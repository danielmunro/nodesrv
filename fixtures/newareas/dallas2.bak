This little courtyard isn't that large, just big enough for a few Ephors
to come out here and get a fresh breath of air. The walls have rain marks
running down them and the ground is covered with flowers and well groomed
grass. The fountain in the middle of the courtyard gives it a nice touch
and the bench makes it very inviting.

A huge pot of some black broth of sort, perhaps a soup, boils over a large
fire in the middle of the room. Bubbles boil and steam rises enabling the 
smell of this liquid to enter your nose. Three torches, one on each wall, 
light the room along with the fire. A bench stands up against the wall for
the cook to rest on, who doesn't appear to be here at the moment.

Gerousia Entranceway~
The Gerousia are the leaders of the city-states that are ran from this
very castle. On the walls are hang wooden blocks with names on them and
their title. Numbering 30, they have been divided up into two groups.
One has only two blocks which are labelled with the names of the current
Spartan kings. The other 28 are the names of the remaining Senate members.
From here you can smell fresh air coming in from the grate above your
head covered with a tiled roof on the outside.

King's Entrance~
The room is decorated with nothing extravagant, torches hanging
from the wall lighting the room, the floor covered with wooden
planks to walk on. In a little hole in the corner of the room, a
small statue of Artemis, the moon God, has been placed here. The
sensation of royalty runs down your spine.

Decorated to please the average Spartan, this room is very much bare.
On the wall are plagues with names of famous Spartan military commanders
with marvelous victories. The floor is covered with wooden planks and

The entranceway has been constructed using a arch. The walls have been
constructed of stone and covered with various descriptions of past

it with a slight smell of smoke and wax.

By far the largest room of all the rooms in the castle. A large pillar
stands in the middle of the room supporting the roof. Many kings stand
around it apparantly talking with each other. The walls have been 
decorated with phalanx spears forming an X. On the far side of the room
is a open window allowing a breeze to enter.

Hoplite's Sanctuary~
Not quite the typical sanctuary. The closest this room gets to comfort
are the bare benches and bunks up against the wall. At most, they're
covered with an inch of padding. In the Centre of the room is a large
firepit surrounded by stone blocks which makes it look like a well.

Several\nreplication of Greek statues line the marble hallways, and solid gold\nframes the fireplace.\n~\n0 0 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30578\nS\n#30580\n1807 Strawberry Lane~\nJust about everything in this house is painted a blinding white. Before the\ninhabitants disappeared, a score of maids would keep this place nice and tidy.\nNow, a substantial layer of dust makes everything gray. Such a waste.\n~\n0 0 0\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30578\nS\n#30581\n1803 Strawberry Lane~\nCertainly one of the richer houses in town, this abode is filled with \ncontemporary artwork. The inhabitants of this household truly appreciate\nwhat is considered to be the most innovative creations of modern society.\nThe picture on the wall of three green dots on a blue background is worth\na year's salary.\n~\n0 0 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30578\nS\n#30582\n1801 Strawberry Lane~\nA more of a modern house, this one has nifty little gadgets here and there\nthat were bought by the sweat of the breadwinner's brow. From the new age\nappliances to the contemporary decorations, this family is quite up to date.\nEven the heating is provided by a circulating hot water system.\n~\n0 0 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30568\nS\n#30583\n1802 Strawberry Lane~\nIt's a very pretty country home with gardens around it. Cozy and comforting,\nyou wouldn't mind staying around here for a while. Through the window, you can\nsee a lovely view of the trees in the backyard, as well as a little pond.\n~\n0 0 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30568\nS\n#30584\n1809 Strawberry Lane~\n1809 is a lovely home that is well-furnished and well-kept. Pictures on the\nwall display that the inhabitants were fairly conservative, middle-class, \nloving family members. You notice a few children's toys scattered across the\nliving room floor.\n~\n0 0 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30569\nS\n#30585\n1804 Strawberry Lane~\nThis home has oak and cherry furnishings for that classic look and warm\nfeeling. It has new carpeting in the family room, and the kitchen has many\nappliances that were probably bought from late night infomercials.\n~\n0 0 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30570\nS\n#30586\n1806 Strawberry Lane~\nWith maintenance-free vinyl siding and efficient easy-to-clean double\nwindows, this home would be great to live in for those who don't care to\nspend too much time keeping house. Inside, there is furniture made from fake\nwood and fabric for even easier clean-up.\n~\n0 0 0\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30570\nS\n#30587\n1808 Strawberry Lane~\nThis home has a comfortable front porch and a deck off the back of the house.\nIt has a fair amount of space in its yards, and flowers dot almost every \nsquare foot of its lot. Inside, there is smooth, gray tile, and a large\nkitchen with an island in the middle of it. Signs of inhabitance, however, \nare non-existent.\n~\n0 0 0\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30571\nS\n#30588\n1811 Strawberry Lane~\nDoilies litter every room. It reeks of cat and medicine in here. You see an\nold, unused chess set, a few porcelain dolls, and several other antiques. A\nglance into the bathroom picks up a set of dentures sitting in a glass. There\nis hair in the shower and the sink.\n~\n0 0 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30571\nS\n#30589\n1810 Strawberry Lane~\nThe house reeks of cats. It's probably one of the oldest houses on this \nstreet, and its conditions, although liveable, aren't exactly top-knotch. You\nglance at the abundance of fantasy paintings on the wall, as well as the many\nodd games lying around. Strange house indeed.\n~\n0 0 0\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30573\nS\n#30590\n1812 Strawberry Lane~\nDefinitely one of the older houses on this street, you suppose that this\nhouse just needs a little bit of imagination and TLC for it to be a winner.\nAfter all, the aesthetically placed holes in the wall provide for a more\nspacious dimension in the living room, and the rotting roof helps to provide\nfor that rustic look. 1812 is most likely the shame of the street.\n~\n0 0 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30573\nS\n#30591\n1813 Strawberry Lane~\nRecently renovated, its new hardwood floors give off a gleam. The paint on \nthe walls is all new, and the bathroom has also been re-done. The owners here\nhave been taking a particular care in keeping this place clean because of its\nrecent make-over, but within a few months, the house will most likely turn \ninto a total mess.\n~\n0 0 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30574\nS\n#30592\n1814 Strawberry Lane~\nThe inhabitants of this household certainly seem to like the color blue. All\nof the walls, furniture, and decorations range from a light powder blue to\nnavy. Off to the side, there is a bubbling aquarium with little fishies that\nadd flickers of color here and there.\n~\n0 0 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30574\nS\n#30593\n1815 Strawberry Lane~\nThis house belongs to a family of dog-lovers. There are pictures of the dogs\nall over the walls, and off to the side, you can see the beds of four \ndifferent canines. Dog toys are strewn about the family room floor, and a\npeek into the laundry room shows you what seems like a lifetime supply of dog\nfood. Odd that the animals have disappeared along with the people.\n~\n0 0 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30575\nS\n#30594\n1816 Strawberry Lane~\nMost of this house is quite bright; if there isn't a lot of sun pouring \nthrough the skylight, then there are a whole lot of lamps to light up the \nroom. It vaguely smells like cleaning spray in here.\n~\n0 0 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30575\nS\n#30595\n1818 Strawberry Lane~\nThe first word that comes to mind when you enter this house is \"excessive.\"\nThere is gold lining everywhere, crystal sculptures, and ornate tapestries\nhanging on the wall. Everything is sparkling clean, just as you would see\nin a well-established, illegal household. Lots of wine and other alcohol\ncan be found in the cabinets.\n~\n0 0 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30576\nS\n#30596\n1820 Strawberry Lane~\nAlthough this house is getting up in its years, the owners have clearly\nattempted to modernize it by putting in new carpeting and wallpaper. The\nrooms are very well-lit due to the overly contemporary light fixtures that\nhang from the ceiling. Sure enough, when you clap your hands, the lights \nwill turn on and off. Many remote controls lie around on the coffee table.\n~\n0 0 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30576\nS\n#30597\n1817 Strawberry Lane~\nYou have entered an average, everyday, middle-class, suburban home. The\nwalls are painted in an off-white that is easy on the eyes, and the \ndecorations are small but tasteful. Pictures of the kids and two dogs line\nthe wall. It is a very charming abode.\n~\n0 0 0\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30577\nS\n#30598\n1822 Strawberry Lane~\nJust about everything in this house is decorated in deep purple velvet. It\nis possible that the owners of this abode have a strange fetish for the\neggplant color, could be color blind, or simply have bad taste, but the\nintensity of furniture's color overwhelms you. You pick up the faint scent\nof lemons. In the middle of the living room is a giant reddish-brown spot\nthat looks like dried vitae.\n~\n0 0 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30577\nS\n#30599\nFront Yard of Sunny Grove Orphanage~\nYou see some dark, crusted, scarlet stains lying in the grass. It smells \nsalty and metallic. You also notice various toys and weapons strewn about\nthe yard in a childish, careless fashion. Up ahead is the Sunny Grove \nOrphanage, from which you can hear some high-pitched sounds. You find it\ndifficult to discern whether they are screams of pain or squeals of delight.\n~\n0 0 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30600\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30564\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nD 0 30500   0 16384\t* Welcome to Fairbridge County north\nM 0 30501   1 30518  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30518   1 16384\t* Maplewood Apartment 203 east\nD 0 30515   2 16384\t* Second Floor of Maplewood Place south\nD 0 30515   3 16384\t* Second Floor of Maplewood Place west\nM 0 30501   3 30512  2\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nM 0 30501   3 30512  2\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30512   1 16384\t* Maplewood Apartment 101 east\nM 0 30501   4 30511  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30511   3 16384\t* First Floor of Maplewood Place west\nM 0 30501   5 30517  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30517   0 16384\t* Second Floor of Maplewood Place north\nD 0 30517   3 16384\t* Second Floor of Maplewood Place west\nM 0 30501   6 30525  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30525   3 16384\t* Whitehall Apartment 102 west\nM 0 30501   7 30526  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30526   3 16384\t* Whitehall Apartment 103 west\nM 0 30501   8 30529  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30529   0 16384\t* Second Floor of Whitehall Apartments north\nD 0 30529   1 16384\t* Second Floor of Whitehall Apartments east\nM 0 30501   9 30532  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30532   3 16384\t* Whitehall Apartment 201 west\nM 0 30501  10 30533  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30533   0 16384\t* First Floor of Roseland Commons north\nD 0 30533   1 16384\t* First Floor of Roseland Commons east\nD 0 30533   3 16384\t* First Floor of Roseland Commons west\nM 0 30501  11 30537  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30537   1 16384\t* Roseland Apartment 102 east\nM 0 30501  12 30538  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30538   1 16384\t* Roseland Apartment 103 east\nM 0 30501  13 30540  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30540   0 16384\t* Second Floor of Roseland Commons north\nD 0 30540   2 16384\t* Second Floor of Roseland Commons south\nD 0 30540   3 16384\t* Second Floor of Roseland Commons west\nM 0 30501  14 30544  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30544   1 16384\t* Roseland Apartment 201 east\nD 0 30534   0 16384\t* First Floor of Roseland Commons north\nD 0 30534   3 16384\t* First Floor of Roseland Commons west\nM 0 30501  15 30546  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30546   0 16384\t* First Floor of Greenwood Ridge north\nD 0 30546   1 16384\t* First Floor of Greenwood Ridge east\nD 0 30546   2 16384\t* First Floor of Greenwood Ridge south\nM 0 30501  17 30547  2\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nM 0 30501  17 30547  2\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30547   1 16384\t* First Floor of Greenwood Ridge east\nD 0 30547   2 16384\t* First Floor of Greenwood Ridge south\nD 0 30547   4 16384\t* First Floor of Greenwood Ridge up\nM 0 30501  18 30555  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30555   3 16384\t* Greenwood Apartment 202 west\nM 0 30501  19 30556  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30556   3 16384\t* Greenwood Apartment 201 west\nM 0 30501  20 30527  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30527   1 16384\t* Second Floor of Whitehall Apartments east\nD 0 30527   2 16384\t* Second Floor of Whitehall Apartments south\nD 0 30527   5 16384\t* Second Floor of Whitehall Apartments down\nM 0 30501  21 30583  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30583   3 16384\t* 1802 Strawberry Lane west\nM 0 30501  23 30579  2\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nM 0 30501  23 30579  2\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30579   3 16384\t* 1805 Strawberry Lane west\nM 0 30501  24 30580  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30580   2 16384\t* 1807 Strawberry Lane south\nM 0 30501  25 30587  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30587   2 16384\t* 1808 Strawberry Lane south\nM 0 30501  26 30588  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30588   0 16384\t* 1811 Strawberry Lane north\nM 0 30501  27 30592  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30592   1 16384\t* 1814 Strawberry Lane east\nM 0 30501  28 30593  1\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30593   3 16384\t* 1815 Strawberry Lane west\nM 0 30501  30 30595  2\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nM 0 30501  30 30595  2\t* a Fairbridge ghost\nD 0 30595   1 16384\t* 1818 Strawberry Lane east\nS\n\n#SHOPS\n0\n\n#SPECIALS\nS\n\n#$\n","position":42700},"values":[{"header":"SPECIALS"}]}]

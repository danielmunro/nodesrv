there....and suddenly all those feelings are gone.

Entrance to the Castle of Critdova.~
You have entered the Castle of Critdova. It's very dark and silent here,
no one seems to be home. Walls of this castle are covered with spider's web.
Under the dust there seems to be a painting of some sort. You are feeling 
strange like someone was watching you, but you cant see anyone...until 
suddenly a man dressed in tailcoat approaches you...

Mythorn's Command Centre~
You stand in the Central Command Station of Mythorn's domain. With
you in the room are several dozen aides and advisors. They all seem
to be running back and forth between various stations and a desk situated
in the corner of the room in such a way that everything in the room can
be taken in at a glance.
The desk itself is a marvel of magic and technology, with more features
than anyone can possibly use in one lifetime. Fortunately, the owner is
immortal so his money was not wasted.

desk~
The desk is made of a curious combination of mahogany, oak and finely
tempered steel. Imbedded within it are numerous screens and readouts,
detailing what is going on in the world. There are so many buttons you
could never hope to press them all. Within the drawers are files on
every person in the SLED, and what Mythorn knows about them.

A gorgeous waterfall~
A lovely waterfall is here, sparkling drops glistening in the sunlight.
Between the trees, you can see a small mountain lake, and the glint of
snow from the peaks of the mountains are all around you.  You spy a quick
glimpse of a deer drinking in a small pool downstream.

South Campus Gate~
This is the southern entrance to the old University. Scattered amongst
the vegetation you can see bones and the odd piece of rusted metal, form
and function now forgotten. Through the trees you can see buildings
crumbling into themselves, covered in vegetation. The remains of a road
lead northward, past a gate, and you can leave to the south.

Ruined store~
You recognize this as having once been a store because of all the
shelves and display cases.  Unfortunately, the entire place has been
stripped of anything even remotely valuable.  Prying back a fallen shelf,
you spy a door.

You haven entered what appears to have once been a storeroom.  Empty
packing crates and discarded wrapping lie all about.  Within the gloom,
you can see something moving.  The stairs lead up behind you.

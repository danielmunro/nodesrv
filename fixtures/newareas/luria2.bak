The Foyer~
This little section hasn't been cleaned in quite a while. A pile of coats and
shoes sits in an apathetic heap, and little shoeprints of mud and blood cover
the linoleum floor. You notice that the closet that is supposed to hold the
cleaning tools is entirely unused. A little framed cross-stitching reads, 
"Home Sweet Home."

The Lobby~
The lobby is but a small collection of couches and chairs that surround a
battered coffee table; you are uncertain of whether the table was bought in
this condition or it had been abused by the residents of the orphanage. The
room seems abandoned, like most other places in Sunny Grove, and the layer 
of dust that has settled on the furniture could be sliced with a knife.

The Dining Hall~
You can't help but pick up the familiar smell of mystery meat. The are long
tables set neatly in rows, with a dozen chairs to each table. The lighting in
here is provided by a set of fluorescent lights on the ceiling, which reflect
against the white walls in a garish manner. You can just picture the children
bowing their heads to say grace before the eat their dinner... wherever the
children are.

First Floor Hallway~
The hallway is plain and simple. The carpet is a dark gray so that most
stains don't show up on it, and the lighting is somewhat dim. You notice
large patches of black, and from the salty-metallic smell here, you presume
it to be blood. How the orphanage came to be such a morbid mess makes you
wonder what happened to the children.

Orphanage Play Room~
The walls are decorated with children's drawings. Although they are all quite
messy, you can still tell what the pictures represent. You can see a clear
progression in the style of the drawings. At first, the pictures are of
mundane things like houses and flowers. The more recently displayed pictures
have lots of black in there as well as bloody weapons. Toys are scattered
about the floor.

Orphanage Office~
The first thing you notice in this room is the door, which has a broken 
window. A long red splash trails down the door in the messy shape of a full-
grown adult. Everything that was once on the desk-- papers, paperweights, 
pens, folders-- now lies scattered across the floor. A file cabinet lies on
its side, looking as if it was used as a ram to get out of the office.

Orphanage Bathroom~
One side of the bathroom is pink and the other side is blue. There are rows
of sinks, toilets, and showers on either side. From the smell of it, the
bathroom hasn't been cleaned in quite a while, but then, your nose picks up
the scent of rot rather than waste. The grout between the tiles has been
thoroughly stained with crimson. What did they use this room for? Storing
dead bodies?... nah.

Orphanage Library~
The orphanage library is full of children's books of all kinds. There are
beanbags and colorful mats here, and it seems to be a fairly happy place.
However, what strikes you as peculiar is the large number of lit candles 
that rest on the bookshelves... it's as if the library has turned into a
shrine of some sort. In the center of a circle of bookshelves is a table
with a book on it. It looks to be some kind of fairy tale book.

Orphanage Stairwell~
The railing on the stairs is scuffed up and chipped. It seems as if there 
have been some aggressive skirmishes here. No one has bothered to clean up
the blood on the floor, which has caked up in the carpet. Are you brave
enough to explore the rest of this building?

Orphanage Living Room~
This seems to be the living room of the orphanage, where children could rest
or talk or watch television. This room has been mainly undisturbed, except
for the bloody corner where they must have stacked bodies. The TV is 
irreparably broken, since there is a giant hole in the screen.

Second Floor Hallway~
Not a living soul resides on this floor. You peek into the bedrooms here and
find them completely empty and messy. Perhaps the children have left to a
safer place, but something tugs at your mind that says otherwise. Every now
and then you hear what may be cries of agony from upstairs.

An Empty Bedroom~
The sheets on the bed are all rumpled up, and the windows have been boarded
up. With how bare the floor and the walls are, this room almost reminds you
of a prison. Torn stuffed animals and broken toys have been left in the
corner, leaving a quiet message of suffering. These kids were most likely
happy living here until whatever it is that happened happened.

Here you find a floor full of screams and moaning. In each of these rooms,
you hear a child's voice that lets out incomprehensible noises. It feels as
if you are in a madhouse... don't let the insanity take hold of you.

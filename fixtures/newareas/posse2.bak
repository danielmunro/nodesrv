The Entrance to the Chateau of the Posse~
It would appear that a small battle happened here.  The door looks as if
it were kicked in and those inside thrown out.  The flower garden looks
as if it had seen better days.  The building itself is rather pleasing to the
eye.  It looks like a quaint and comfortable place.  It also looks like a
nice place to hide out, or plan an ambush....

The Chateau of the Posse~
In the middle of this room is roaring fire.  It is a cozy room.  The place
has been well kept up considering it was taken by force from the
previous owners.  This seems like a nice place to kick back, relax, and
reflect on the day's battles.  Before you is a large pit.  The pit looks
perfect for storing extra equipment or making donations to those in
need.  To the east lies the Bunk House, to the west is the clan store, and
to the south is a nice outdoor garden.

The Specialty Store~
This is a really nice place. There are all kinds interesting things scattered
about the store.  The store has been well decorated and appears to be
quite clean.   I guess the store owner has friends in high places in the
Posse.  You can buy all kinds of things here.  The shop keeper has quite
good taste, but mind you all things you see here are not for sale.

The Bunk House~
It would appear that all the nice beds are in here.  Although all the
bedding has been thrown about the room,  this looks like a nice place to
sleep and heal your wounds.  There are cots, beds, and bunks all over
the room.  Some of the Posse seem to be a bit sloppy, as there are
clothes and bloody weapons strewn all over the place.  For some
strange reason there seems to be something magical about the bunk
house.  It feels as if you just heal faster in here than anywhere else.
This room just gives you a feeling of  goodness, for some that makes
you feel quite at home, but for those members of the Posse that are
more evil, this room tends to make you queasy.

The Garden~
As you step outside the Chateau you are met by the wonderful smell of
beautiful flowers.  Who ever cared for this garden was a master,
because even those with the blackest of hearts could easily find peace
here.  You can hear the singing of birds and the buzzing of bees as they
gather pollen from the flowers.  This seems to be one of the few places
that the Posse has left untouched since their arrival.  You spy a set of 
stairs leading down under a rose bush.

Posse's Portal Room~
This room has an air of anticipation about it, as though it knew you were
about to use one of its portals to hunt an unfortunate soul.  The walls
are hewn out of solid pyrite, and the floor gleams where it has been worn
from the tread of many feet.  A short ivory pillar rises from the floor,
ebony writing inscribed upon it.  Across the room from you, the wall seems
to shimmer slightly, and seems darker than the rest of the room.

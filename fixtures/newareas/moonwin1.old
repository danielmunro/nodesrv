The Other side of the Mirror~
Upon stepping thru the mirror, things become clearer.  The world takes on a more
angular look.  This is no longer real, but you know it's real enough to kill you
if you don't play the game.  The motifs of Chess are emblazoned on the corridors
, guilded for old times sake.

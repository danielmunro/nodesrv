Kathy~
Kathy is here, busing tables for your meager tips.
~
Garbed in the skimpiest and most revealing outfit you've ever seen, a
beautiful, young woman awaits to serve you.  Your eyes continually 
stray to a full bosom, as it bustles eagerly from its confines. The black
leather garter shirt, combined with the skin-tight mini skirt creates a feeling
of desire and ecstasy. She stands straight back, with her thick, auburn hair
spilling over corner straight shoulders. Her eyes are an angry emerald.
 
Just one look at her, and you can tell that she hates her job.

Kevin~
Kevin is here tempting your sweet tooth.
~
With a spotless white apron draped across his potbellied stomach, a sly, oily 
man glances at you with a grin full of yellowed teeth.  His black hair and 
beard seems to have been slicked back with rat grease.  It shinned dully in 
the light. He stands tall, though you'd never notice because of how he stoops 
over the oaken counter that displays his various goods.

A Secluded Corner~
This room is clearly set apart from the rest of the house. The room has 
been painted a somber black, with red mixed in the paint to make walls seem 
to be on fire when the light touches them. to the side of the room, a 
comfortable black leather couch rests against the wall. The couch seems to 
curve around a small, eloquent table.

Within the Coffee House~
The scent of coffee fills the air and invigorates your spirit.  This place is the 
perfect place to sit down and enjoy a cup of java while you read a good book.
Off in the distance you think you can make out what appears to be a stage.

The Confectionary~
Smells of baking bread and delicious pastries fill your nose. Bags of flower 
seem to be strewn about a wooden counter. The counter itself seems to 
made of solid wood, and painted black. Its quite plain, and ordinary, and has 
the stores wares displayed on small trays. Your mouth waters at the scents, 
despite the shopkeepers appearance.

The Stage~
The most dominant feature of the room, a large oaken stage stands
gleaming before you.  Its surface had been lovingly polished, to shine and
dazzle those that will be entertained by its performers.  Stationed around
the stage are several comfortable looking chairs. 
 
The legs on each chair are carved in some mythical creature, ranging from 
banshee to dragon.  When you sit in one of these chairs, your thoughts seem 
to drift, and your mind relaxes as you listen to the poetry.

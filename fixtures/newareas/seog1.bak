Cave entrance~
You stand in the entrance to a cave.  Something ominous can be felt
further into the cave, though no sound can be heard.  It is quite
dark, and your light seems somehow inadequate to dispell the
shadows.  Wisdom tells you to turn back now...

Inside the cave~
Once inside the cave, you begin to realize that the cavern
is truly vast.  The blackness suggests an ominous depth.
In addition to the stifling dark, the presence of things
ancient and forgotten can be felt.

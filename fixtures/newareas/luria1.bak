Fairbridge ghost~
a Fairbridge ghost~
An unhappy ghost lingers on in this world.
~
You can barely see the features that ouline the specter's face. It cries
silently, its long fingers stretching out to touch you. It has a story to tell,
but it cannot speak.

Welcome to Fairbridge County~
Your travels lead you to what looks like a picturesque, modern-day town. A
large white billboard stands in the grass and reads, "Welcome to Fairbridge
County!" in navy blue cursive script. The city looks to be a lovely place
where nothing bad could possibly ever happen.

Madison Avenue~
Madison Avenue takes you into the little town of Fairbridge. Magically clean 
streets are lined with neatly trimmed trees of every variety. You would expect
for there to be children out playing right now, or for someone to be trimming 
the lawn, but there doesn't seem to be anyone out here today. No matter-- you
will most likely meet someone in this town soon enough.

Madison Avenue~
Hm... there still isn't anyone out in the streets. To the west you see the
entrance to Maplewood Place, and to the east, Whitehall Apartments. They both
seem to be fine dwellings, and you wonder if perhaps the Fairbridge citizens
prefer their living rooms to the neatly trimmed yards outside. And yet, some
thing tugs at your mind to tell you that something might be amiss in this 
town... perhaps the citizens are hiding from something?

Madison Avenue brings you further into Fairbridge, but your intuition tells
you to stay on your guard. After all, without any people, vehicles, or even
animals out here, something must be amiss. All you can hear is absolute
silence, and you wonder if perhaps this lovely city has only recently been
deserted. Perhaps it's up to you to find where everyone has gone.

Where on earth have all of the Fairbridge citizens gone? To the west you see
Roseland Commons, and to the east, Greenwood Ridge. The apartments are 
certainly worth searching for any clues. This beautiful city has become a
ghost town, and its glaring emptiness nags at your sense of courage.

Intersection of Madison and Kennedy~
You have reached the not-so-busy intersection of Madison and Kennedy Avenue.
In fact, you can walk along these roads just fine without any worry about
getting hit by cars or even pets on the loose. Everything is eerily quiet, 
just like the rest of the town. To the west, you can see a sign for the 
Fairbridge Public Library, and to the east, you can see all sorts of buildings
that are probably locked up.

Fluorescent lighting provides a cheap, efficient way to light up the hallway.
The carpeting is dark green with a blue flower pattern covering it. The walls
are a moderate beige, and you can see the mailboxes in the wall. A potted
plant sits in the corner, and there are also several windows here. To the 
west is Apartment 101.

The slight scent of cigarettes whiffs under your nose. Perhaps it is the 
nicotine that is contributing to the slight yellowing of the walls, or it
could just be old age. In any case, the apartment hallway still seems to be
quite clean-- no litter around, no cracks in the wall, well-vacuumed carpet.
To the west is Apartment 102.

or, at the very least, a clue as to their whereabouts.

Several lights line this hallway in a yellowish glow. The floor is made of 
white tile with flecks of gray on them. A little bit of dust covers the floor,
but nothing else can really be seen. The mailboxes in the wall probably haven't
been touched for a long time, but it's unapparent as to why the mailman or
citizens never visit them anymore. To the east is Apartment 101.

Hm, they certainly were creative in naming this place. With the exception of
the little gray flecks on the floor, the hallway is completely white. You
wonder if perhaps this building is very new because of how clean it is. The 
only thing that you happen to notice that is out of place is a broken window.
Most of the shattered glass has already been cleaned up. To the east is
Apartment 102.

The hallway is quite plain and boring. White, white, white all around, and
not a single person to be seen. There's a creepy feeling still in the air,
though, and you may want to keep and eye out for anything strange. Stairs
lead up to the second floor, and Apartment 103 is to the east.

The wooden stairs are slightly dusty, but they are without dirt or trash. It

seems to live in them, but the question is where they have all gone. There

to gather on them as well. Perhaps you should investigate this room a little
more thoroughly.

water it someday. You've yet to find any real clues as to what's happened in
Fairbridge, but it's worth it to keep looking. At the moment, you could try
looking in Apartment 103 or going up to the second floor.

Tall hedges surround you. The plants are all attended to with the utmost

The sun shines warmly upon you, and there is a happy peacefulness here. The
willows shift gently with the air currents, and birds chirp in the branches.

There really ought to be rules against poisoning the air for your neighbors
with mothballs. The stench almost makes you gag, but you're at that point
where you can just barely tolerate it. The stairs lead up to, not the third,

there is Apartment 103.

Strawberry Lane continues east and south here. You figure that the only 
reason why Fairbridge decided to make circular roads is because they needed
some kind of excitement in this town. The people here, however, seem to find
extra excitement in their creative mailboxes. To the north, 1810 has a giant
hand that holds its mailbox, and to the west, 1812 has one in the shape of
a dragon.

replication of Greek statues line the marble hallways, and solid gold

house just needs a little bit of imagination and TLC for it to be a winner.
After all, the aesthetically placed holes in the wall provide for a more
spacious dimension in the living room, and the rotting roof helps to provide
for that rustic look. 1812 is most likely the shame of the street.

will turn on and off. Many remote controls lie around on the coffee table.

eggplant color, could be color blind, or simply have bad taste, but the
intensity of furniture's color overwhelms you. You pick up the faint scent
of lemons. In the middle of the living room is a giant reddish-brown spot
that looks like dried vitae.

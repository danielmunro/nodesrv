The South Gate of Northtown~
You have left the dirt road and continue your way to the South gate of
Northtown on a well-kept cobbled road. Massive white walls stretch to
either side of you, broken by the great iron gates up ahead. A bell 
sounds somewhere behind the walls and the gates begin to slide open with
ease, allowing you entrance into the trade city of Northtown.

The Cobbled Road Beneath the Great Gates~
Torches line the walls, allowing you to make your way under the great walls
of Northtown. You emerge out into the open expanse of the gate district.
Two guard posts lie to either side of you. The cobbled road continues north.

A Guardhouse~
You enter a squat stone guardhouse set against the great southern wall.
Guardsmen mill about on their various tasks. A dark wooden desk stands in 
the centre of the room, a man seated behind it, pouring over a dissorganised
array of documents. The only exit lies back to the west.

A Guardhouse~
You enter a squat guardhouse set against the great southern wall. Guardsmen
mill about on various tasks. A small jail has been built against the
western wall. The jail is big enough to fit about two men, and is obviously
used for temporary prisoners, awaiting transfer to a bigger prison. The
only other exit leads back east.

the cathedral style dwelling of deep leather furnishings.\nThe black steel gates tower high into the air before you, barring your exit.\nThrough the huge spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.\nLarge black-tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that\nserve as lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and\ngrey marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Plush deep black\nleather furniture placed sparsely around invites you to sit down and relax.\nThe walls are tastefully decorated with weapons and armour. The ceilings \nare over one hundred feet high, and are covered in scenes of dragon battle. \n~\n0 CDKNT 1\nH 200 M 200\nO ruiner~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 16500   3 16500  2\t* the guard of Matook\nE 1

the world.\n \nLove life when all is calm\nrun and hide when not\nfor fear resides in those that think\nthat anger is not hot.\n \nLove is blind to those you see\nwho wish to live in harmony.\nOne cannot love with anger and hate\nfor fear will always rule one's fate.\n \nFear is a word best described\nas a disease one has caught up inside.\nRun young child run born free\nfor fear is not your destiny.\n \nHealth and happiness are your sword\nfor love and laughter are your goal.\nTo live a life full of peace\nOne must love or see it decrease.\n============================================\nThe Church of Matook was built with help\nfrom too many to name, yet they deserve\ngreat credit for their faithful service\non the path to

the cathedral style dwelling of deep leather furnishings.\nThe black steel gates tower high into the air before you, barring your exit.\nThrough the huge spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.\nLarge black-tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that\nserve as lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and\ngrey marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Plush deep black\nleather furniture placed sparsely around invites you to sit down and relax.\nThe walls are tastefully decorated with weapons and armour. The ceilings \nare over one hundred feet high, and are covered in scenes of dragon battle. \n~\n0 CDKNT 1\nH 200 M 200\nO ruiner~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 16500   3 16500  2\t* the guard of Matook\nE 1

the cathedral style dwelling of deep leather furnishings.\nThe black steel gates tower high into the air before you, barring your exit.\nThrough the huge spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.\nLarge black-tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that\nserve as lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and\ngrey marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Plush deep black\nleather furniture placed sparsely around invites you to sit down and relax.\nThe walls are tastefully decorated with weapons and armour. The ceilings \nare over one hundred feet high, and are covered in scenes of dragon battle. \n~\n0 CDKNT 1\nH 200 M 200\nO ruiner~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 16500   3 16500  2\t* the guard of Matook\nE 1

huge spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.\nLarge black-tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that\nserve as lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and\ngrey marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Plush deep black\nleather furniture placed sparsely around invites you to sit down and relax.\nThe walls are tastefully decorated with weapons and armour.

the cathedral style dwelling of deep leather furnishings.\nThe black steel gates tower high into the air before you, barring your exit.\nThrough the huge spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.\nLarge black-tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that\nserve as lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and\ngrey marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Plush deep black\nleather furniture placed sparsely around invites you to sit down and relax.\nThe walls are tastefully decorated with weapons and armour. The ceilings \nare over one hundred feet high, and are covered in scenes of dragon battle. \n~\n0 CDKNT 1\nH 200 M 200\nO ruiner~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 16500   3 16500  2\t* the guard of Matook\nE 1

the cathedral style dwelling of deep leather furnishings.\nThe black steel gates tower high into the air before you, barring your exit.\nThrough the huge spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.\nLarge black-tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that\nserve as lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and\ngrey marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Plush deep black\nleather furniture placed sparsely around invites you to sit down and relax.\nThe walls are tastefully decorated with weapons and armour. The ceilings \nare over one hundred feet high, and are covered in scenes of dragon battle. \n~\n0 CDKNT 1\nH 200 M 200\nO ruiner~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 16500   3 16500  2\t* the guard of Matook\nE 1

the world.\n \nLove life when all is calm\nrun and hide when not\nfor fear resides in those that think\nthat anger is not hot.\n \nLove is blind to those you see\nwho wish to live in harmony.\nOne cannot love with anger and hate\nfor fear will always rule one's fate.\n \nFear is a word best described\nas a disease one has caught up inside.\nRun young child run born free\nfor fear is not your destiny.\n \nHealth and happiness are your sword\nfor love and laughter are your goal.\nTo live a life full of peace\nOne must love or see it decrease.\n============================================\nThe Church of Matook was built with help\nfrom too many to name, yet they deserve\ngreat credit for their faithful service\non the path to

the cathedral style dwelling of deep leather furnishings.\nThe black steel gates tower high into the air before you, barring your exit.\nThrough the huge spiked bars you can see a Gothic Cathedral style dwelling.\nLarge black-tarnished chains hang from the ceiling, supporting torches that\nserve as lighting to the main hall.  The floor is a highly polished white and\ngrey marble that flawlessly spans the expanse of space.  Plush deep black\nleather furniture placed sparsely around invites you to sit down and relax.\nThe walls are tastefully decorated with weapons and armour. The ceilings \nare over one hundred feet high, and are covered in scenes of dragon battle. \n~\n0 CDKNT 1\nH 200 M 200\nO ruiner~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 16500   3 16500  2\t* the guard of Matook\nE 1

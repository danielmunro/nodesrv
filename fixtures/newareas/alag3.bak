moat sea monster~
a hideous monster~
A monster swims about the moat, attacking anything that moves.
~
You look upon a terribly deformed monster.  You can only imagine what this creature
used to be.  Obviously the toxins from this moat have mutated this creature beyond
recognition.  Hopefully you can sneak past it without it noticing.

Before a Drawbridge~
You stand before an immense drawbridge leading into Nottingham Castle.  Upon the
bridge stands two of Nottingham's most elite guards.  You can spot at least two more
on the walls.  Invasion of such a place will not be easy.  You begin to contemplate
how best to attack the castle.

Upon a Drawbridge~
You stand upon a wooden bridge.  It seems to be the only way into Nottingham Castle.
Well, the only reasonable way.  Below the bridge on either side you can see the
filthy moat that surrounds the castle.  A large iron gate is at the far end of the 
bridge.  It looks as though it could be lowered quickly to keep intruders out, or
perhaps, to keep prevent someone from escaping.

Within the Moat~
You have jumped from the bridge into the moat below.  The cold water of the moat
begins to make you shiver.  While the smell of the stagnated water is almost too much
to stand.  You begin to think there is something moving in the water but you decide
it is just your imagination.  Nothing could live in this putrid hole.

Within the Moat~
You thought the smell was rancid when you first came into the moat but this is even
worse.  You now see the source of the smell though, it looks as though the sewer
from the castle empties out into the moat.  The sewer is covered with a large metal
grate that doesn't even budge.

Within Notthingham's Sewers~
You stand within the sewers of Nottingham.  The smell is far worse than anything you
have ever imagined.  The only source of light other than your own is the light that
is filtering through a large metal grate to the south.  This pipeline leads to the
North where it branches off into other lines.  You can only guess where all those
tunnels may lead.

Within Nottingham's Sewers~
The putrid smell of the sewer is almost overwhelming.  The sewage flows Southward
towards what looks to be a natural source of light.  This large tunnel splits into
three smaller ones to the North, West and East.

Before the Castle Gates~
To the south is the drawbridge that leads into Nottingham Castle.  You stand before
a large iron gate.  There are at least two guard towers here in the front of the
castle.  Patrols of Elite Nottingham Guards pass by every few minutes.  You realize
that if you do not have a good plan for getting in and out of this castle there is a
good chance that you won't make it out alive.

Within the gates of Nottingham Castle~
You have just stepped inside the gates of Nottingham Castle.  You look across a very
large courtyard.  The various towers of the castle loom over you.  To the North is
the Castle main.  To the East you can see the barracks of the Prince's men.  To the
West you can see the field where various festivals are held.  At your back is a large
metal gate.  If the guards close it, then you will have to find a new route out of
the castle.

Nottingham Castle Courtyard~
Just to the East is the guard barracks, to the North you can see the main castle.  You
can see the tournament and festival grounds.  High above you the towers of Nottingham
castle are guarded by the Prince's men.  If the alarm is sounded then you know that
there is a good chance you will not get out alive.

Nottingham Guard Barracks~
The barracks of Nottingham Castle is quite comfortable.  The guards come here to rest
and prepare for another day of defending Prince John.  The room is rather large with
four beds that the guards use.  On the Northern wall of the room you see a door that
leads to the guards' toilet.

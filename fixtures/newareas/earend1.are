and this sod doesn't look any different.  Feeling slighted because he did

Mayor Stan~
Stan the Mayor~
Stan, the Mayor of Wooster, stands here
~
A gawky, balding academic, Stan, the Mayor of Wooster, seems an odd choice for
the leader of such a warlike group of people.  He is, however, a master at
logistics and long-range planning.  Very often he saved the town, not by his
sword, but by his pen.  Stan is beloved by the people of Wooster and is often
seen walking the streets so as not to get out of touch with his people's needs.

The Lord of Kenyon~
The Lord of Kenyon struts around proudly.
~
The Lord of Kenyon stands here.  The House of Kenyon is an old one but one
that has fallen in stature over time.  The Lords of Kenyon are not aware
of this fact however, and their pride is legendary.  This Lord is a vain
and haughty man, he had sworn an oath that he will humble the people of 
Wooster and is assembling a massive army to do so.  His leadership skills
might just be the downfall of his grand ambitions.

The Yeomen of Oberlin are not known for their fighting ability.  In
fact the only reason this poor sap is here is because Lord of Kenyon
threatened to beat him up if he didn't come and fight.  The Yeoman
of Oberlin would much rather be back home reading a book, or enjoying
one of his "herbal cigarettes".

Jackie is a busy lady.  She is the one who is really running Wooster.
Stan may be a wonderful guy, but he really hates paperwork, and he leaves
it for Jackie to do.  Jackie looks a bit frazzled right now, it might not
be a wise idea to ask a favor of here.

The Alleghany Alligator is going to eat you alive!
~
This ferocious beast comes from the swamps of Alleghany.  It took the Lord
of Kenyon an entire company of men to capture this particular specimen.
Alleghany Gators are feared throughout the land for their ferocity, cunning
and deadliness.  This beast could bring about the downfall of Wooster. 
And it looks like it's going to be your downfall as well.

The untamed forest of Wittenberg is home to this evil beast.  The tigers
of Witt are sentient creatures who take great delight in causing mayhem.
It took a company of the Lord of Kenyon's finest troops to corral this
mammoth beast.  A creature like this can level an entire village by itself.

this simple fact then the people of Wooster will not be forced to beat
on you.  Thank you and have a nice day.

The Road to Wooster~
You are standing on the middle of a large plain.  The sky above is blue, and 
the rolling hills are covered with waist high grass.  Stretching north is a

iron affair that seems to have taken a beating in its long lifetime.  Since the
people of Wooster are enjoying a period of peace the gates are open for all to
enter.  Of course you could just go home.

This is Beall Avenue, which in the curious dialect of Wooster is pronounced
"bell".  Beall Avenue is the major roadway in the town of Wooster.  The street
is with brick and the buildings around you also  demonstrate the skill with 
which the inhabitants craft buildings of stone.  To the north lies more of
Beall, while the gates are directly to the south.

organized mess.  Leroy has been providing alchemal services to the town for
for years upon years and he is a beloved figure in the community.  On a desk
you notice a tome labeled "CDC" it looks rather dog-eared, it must contain
Leroy's favorite recipes.

bustle about, seemingly oblivious to the grandiose scene in front of them.
Beall Avenue runs through the square in a north-south direction.  To the east

a map of Wooster and the surrounding area.  There is a staircase leading up
to General Barnes' private office, and a staircase leading down to the Vault,
where the records are kept.

This is the camp of the NCAC...the North Coast Armed Conference.  Ok, so the name
is kind of stupid, but they didn't have much time to come up with a snazzy  
acronym.  Anyway, the NCAC is a loose allegiance of towns, cities, and villages 
dedicated to humbling Wooster, and stealing the treasures contained inside it.
In all honesty they're mostly a bunch of bumblers, but this time they have two
secret weapons...better watch your step.

Liberty Avenue~
More of Liberty Avenue.  Most of the buildings along this street seem to
be storage units.  Nothing that catches your fancy.

Liberty Avenue~
This is Liberty Avenue.  As always the street is paved with brick.  This
section of the road is lined with residential homes, pretty boring really.
The road intersects with Beall Avenue to the east and continues on to the
west.

Bowman Street~
As you stroll down Bowman Street you find that it is really, really boring.
The street is lined with private residences and nothing that holds your 
interest for too long.  Well, except for that large, iron-bound door to
the east, and the road junction to the north.

A Guard Room~
This is one of the guard rooms defending the gates of Wooster.  From here
defenders can slaughter those who manage to break through the outer gates.
Because the town is not under siege the guardroom is only staffed by a lowly
security officer, instead of a member of the Wooster Guard.

Galpin Hall~
Galpin Hall is the administrative nerve center for Wooster.  Stan the Mayor
has his office here, though he is very rarely there.  Galpin is an unassuming 
little building, quite a departure from the grandiose architecture that seems 
so prevalent in the rest of Wooster.  Could it be that the civil servants of so
Wooster believe themselves to be just that, servants of the people?  Seems 
hard to believe.  At any rate Stan's office up that flight of stairs in the back.  
Other than that the only exit is the way you came.

The Vault is a dry, dusty place.  There really isn't much to do here,
unless you are a student of history and wish to look over old battle
reports.  You see several academics doing just that right now.  However,
an active person like yourself would probably be better off going back
upstairs where all the action is.

The Office of General Barnes~
This is the office of General Barnes, the commander of the Wooster Army.
A large table dominates the center of the room.  It is here that Barnes plans
campaigns to defeat the enemies of Wooster.  You could exit from the large 
windows, but the drop would not be fun.  Your best bet is to go down the stair-
case you came up.

To the west you see a pair of large, evil-looking cages, while to the east
you see a collection of tents.

This is where the Lord of Kenyon directs his host.  The tent is huge, in

Gambier.  The throne of the Lord of Kenyon dominates the room.  You are 
left unimpressed with the opulance of the room.

The sounds of the Dave Matthews Band fill the air, sitting next to the CD player
you see cases for not only the Dave Matthews Band, but REM, Jewel, Sarah

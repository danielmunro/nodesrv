Hundreds of tiny bubbles\ndive downwards the burst free, escaping back up to the surface. The rumble\nof the waterfall thrumps through the water. Schools of glowing fish dart\nthrough the water and create a sea of swarming color below the waves. \nColorful pebbles form the lake bottom and glint with reflected light. \nShadowy forms swim within your range of vision, then quickly fade away.\nThey cast flickering shadows across the bumpy lake bottom. The strong       \ncurrent tugs against you and pulls you to the south.\n~\n0 D 6\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 12590\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 12586\nS\n#12599\nA Magelab~\nYou stand in a small magelab. Scrolls and other magical items are \nstacked in neat rows against the back wall. A slight breeze blows through\nan opened stained glass window. Light streams through it and casts \ncolorful patterns around the room. A peaceful aura hangs in the air.

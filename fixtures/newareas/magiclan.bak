The Healer stands here.

The old man smiles curtly and returns your gaze as he stands guard at
the gate.  Those passing by Clan Road may wonder how an old man like him
was hired to guard the gate to the great hall of Honor, but among the
members of Honor it is common knowledge that he was one of the first
adventurers who slew the diamond dragon that threatened the inhabitants
of Midgaard long ago.  He received a handsome reward for his feat, but
rumour has it that he gambled it all away at the casino of Atlantis. In
any case he now spends his days as the gate guard and also sells some
spells on the side.  Through your trained senses you get the feeling that
his magic is still as potent as ever.  Maybe you should buy a spell or two.
Type 'heal' to see a listing of spells.

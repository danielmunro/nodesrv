A dresser and wardrobe\nline the south wall, and on the north wall is a small\nwriting desk and chair.

Lounge \nchairs are evenly placed in a row facing the immense windows.\nThe view from here is incredible.  Instead of lawn for miles,\nall you can see is clouds.

A dresser and wardrobe\nline the south wall, and on the north wall is a small\nwriting desk and chair.

Lounge \nchairs are evenly placed in a row facing the immense windows.\nThe view from here is incredible.  Instead of lawn for miles,\nall you can see is clouds.

Two large and comfortable-\nlooking leather arm-chairs adorn the center of the library together with\na huge oak desk.

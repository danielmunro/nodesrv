The\nroom seems abandoned, like most other places in Sunny Grove, and the layer \nof dust that has settled on the furniture could be sliced with a knife.\n~\n0 0 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30602\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30603\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30600\nS\n#30602\nThe Dining Hall~\nYou can't help but pick up the familiar smell of mystery meat. The are long\ntables set neatly in rows, with a dozen chairs to each table. The lighting in\nhere is provided by a set of fluorescent lights on the ceiling, which reflect\nagainst the white walls in a garish manner.

Although they are all quite\nmessy, you can still tell what the pictures represent. You can see a clear\nprogression in the style of the drawings. At first, the pictures are of\nmundane things like houses and flowers. The more recently displayed pictures\nhave lots of black in there as well as bloody weapons.

A long red splash trails down the door in the messy shape of a full-\ngrown adult. Everything that was once on the desk-- papers, paperweights, \npens, folders-- now lies scattered across the floor.

From the smell of it, the\nbathroom hasn't been cleaned in quite a while, but then, your nose picks up\nthe scent of rot rather than waste. The grout between the tiles has been\nthoroughly stained with crimson. What did they use this room for?

There are\nbeanbags and colorful mats here, and it seems to be a fairly happy place.\nHowever, what strikes you as peculiar is the large number of lit candles \nthat rest on the bookshelves... it's as if the library has turned into a\nshrine of some sort. In the center of a circle of bookshelves is a table\nwith a book on it. It looks to be some kind of fairy tale book.\n~\n0 0 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 30606\nS\n#30609\nFirst Floor Hallway~\nThe hallway is plain and simple.

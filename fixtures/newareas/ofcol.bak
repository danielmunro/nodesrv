Thief guild~
Thieves have build their guildhouse near the wharf in hope
for quick income from drunken sailors. and for quick getaway
into safety. The inside of this place however, looks like 
it's just plain hiding place nothing more. There is no 
marks of anyone living here or actually that anyone has
been here in last ten years. Even the dust is knee thick
at the entrance. However, you can feel someone watching you.

granite rock, its smooth surface showing some text. Another exotic stone
road branches off to your left, where you can see the wharf jutting out 
over the sea. The South will lead you to the alley which leads back to God's

the merchant kept the key for this room that he is in fact in charge of the
distribution of the fish stock. The stench is almost unbearable, but despite
the smell the room is kept clean, the floors spotless, except for straw filled
boxes awaiting their next fishloads. A small window lets in light in the right
corner of the room. The only exit lies to the East.

wall give the room a warm feel. Above the fireplace an oil painting depicting
the Almighty graces the wall. To your left stand a simple bed, and next to it 
a small wooden dressing table. The only light comes from a candle upon the 
mantle above the fireplace. All possible views of the sea are blocked by the

You walk off the stone road onto a bright green patch of grass before an
old Church. Rows of plants line the area to your right, and you guess that
the priests grow their own vegetable to complement the endless supply of
fish. The church is a large single story house, with nothing showing it as
a church, except the small belltower atop the roof. This seems like a humble
place for a humble people. The priests tending their grass and plants have
content expressions on their faces, and they greet you as you enter their
home. There is a door to the East which leads into the old church.

there is alot of activity. A man stand behind an old wooden desk, sawing a 
long length of wood, a boy stand further behind him holding up the other end
of the plank. The back of the house opens out onto the wharf, where you see
wood piled up and tools set up to help the boatbuilder. The sawing continues.
You can head west out onto the wharf through the shop, or you can go back
East onto Fisherman's Way.

your right stretches a patch of grass, which follows Fisherman's Way to the
end, where a small house can be seen before the road seems to end at the
rocks jutting from the ground. To your west you can see the end of the wharf
rocks jutting from the ground. To your west you can see the end of the wharf
jutting out past the food hall. A lone seagull rests atop one of the rocks
up ahead, on closer look you see that the road in fact continues further
between the rocks.

Fisherman's Way~
You have made your way to the end of Fisherman's Way. A small path continues
off the main road to the North between the boulders. To your right is a
small stone house. A wooden awning hangs over the front of the house and an old
lady sits beneath is, in the shade, on a wooden chair. She gives a start as
she notices you, but her surprise turns into a warm smile. A table stands
against the outside wall, displaying packed fish of various species. You can
continue North on the small path between the boulders, or go East into the old
ladies shop.

The Sea's Blessings~
You walk into the small shop and are overwhelmed by the assortment of goods
on display. Shells of various shapes, colour and size are displayed amongst
glowing pearls, and pearl necklaces. Old scrolls line a wooden shelf to your
right, and jars containing unknown liquids rest atop another set of shelves
tucked away in the corner to your left. Old sharks teeth, clean of any meat
hang from the ceiling, some still attached to the jaws. Home-made fishing
poles are stacked below the display counter in front of you. A closed door
leads further into the shop, obviously a part of the house you could not see
from the road.

The Bountiful Harvest~
This small shop is busy with customers haggling for fish. Mounds of fish
are stacked all around you, the fish in different shapes and sizes. A man
stand behind a flat counter to your right, haggling with his customers.
"My fish is caught by me and my men, we are making a living off the
Almighties gift to us", " I dont expect to be out of pocket and food by the
time i am finished here !" A boy stand behind the fish racks, placing the
ordered fish into small leather bags provided by the customers, the less
fortunate customers take the fish by hand. The only exit lies East.

The Fisherman's Praise~
The smell of delicious spices and cooked seafood greet you as you enter a
large house full of people. Table and benches take up most of the space, and
a small food preparation area is set off to one side. Smoke forms from all the
cooking, but is sucked away up a well constructed metal chimnet. People are
seated at their chosen tables, enjoying the meals prepared here. Two large
windows are unshuttered, and show a loves view of the sea. This seems like a
great place to sit and enjoy a meal and praise the fishermen for a fish well
caught. A bell tolls outside and the people around you stop what they are doing
to bow their heads in a moments silence before continuing. The only exit leads
East, back to Fisherman's Way.

Ofcol Wharf~
The wharf underfoot is solid as you step off the main road. The planks
that make up the medium sized wharf are fitted with perfection, and no
trace of fish entrails or any sign that fish were cleaned and gutted 
remains. You hear the lapping of the water up against the wharf supports
below. Currently no boats are moored against the wharf, obviously the
catch is good, and the time is right. A couple wharf workers are ambling
about, possibly waiting for the next boat to arrive before they can begin
their tasks. The wharf continues in all directions, except East.

Ofcol Wharf~
You continue southwards along the wooden deck of the wharf. A crab scuttles
across your path, eyeing you before scutting back under the wharf. It seems
this port teems with sealife, a marvel. A large swell knocks the poles of
the wharf under you, creating a slight spray which moistens your face. A
couple wharf workers are sitting with their feet dangling off the edge of the
wharf, another dozes on the grass to the back of the stockhouse. The wharf
continues south, before coming to an end at a great white wall from one of the
estates. The wall goes straight down and meets with the sea, before being
submerged, its base somewhere beneath the ocean debths.

Ofcol Wharf~
You have walked along the southern part of the wharf and come to an abrubt
end at a great white wall. The wall spams roughly twenty feet high, dwarfing
the surrounding port houses. To your left you see the well, obviously used
to provide fresh water to the port villagers. A boy sits on the edge of the
wharf, wooden rod in his hand, trying his luck for the catch. You can head
back north along the wharf, or east to the well and back onto Fisherman's Way.

Ofcol Wharf~
The Ofcol wharf has been marvelously constructed to allow the wooden deck
to continue out over the sea; A peer of sorts where boats and the larger
vessels can dock without the trouble of rocks, or city walls. In a sudden
rush, people move past you west, firther along the wharf, you can hear
a commotion up ahead, but too many people no block your way. A splash sounds
ahead before being drowned by the "oohs" and "aahs" of the small crowd.
You can try make your way west, or back to the main wharf to your east.

You push your way through the crowd towards the end of the peer. Many people
glance your way, but nothing is said, as their attention is focused on
the water in front of the deck. You make your way further and peer over the
edge. To your surprise you see the most beautiful woman swimming amongst the
swells. Suddenly her head goes underwater and a green shimmering tail whips
water towards you. She giggles and dissapears underwater before re-emerging.
The only exit is east.

this port teems with sealife, a marvel. A large swell knocks the poles of
the wharf under you, creating a slight spray which moistens your face. 
Wharf workers are sitting with their feet dangling off the edge of the wharf,
relaxing before the next boat comes in.The wharf continues north and south.

You make your way further north along the ofcol wharf. There are no workers
along this part of the deck. You notice a small boat moored here, where
previously you could have sworn there was none. You can see the end of the
wharf up ahead to your north, and the expanse of the sea beyond. To you east
stands the bountiful harvest, fish shop, its back door closed.

The end of the ofcol wharf ! Be careful not to trip or you will be smashed
on the barnacled rocks below. A lone seagull perches on the wooden pole
which is bound to the end of the wooden deck. Water hisses and splashes
against the rocks below, causing an everlasting haze of salt water in the
air over the wharf end. To your east you can hear the sounds of many voices
through the windows of the Food hall. You can turn back south along the
wharf.

The Tor~
Tall, knee deep grass rolls and waves in the breeze as you look down
the hill.  The moon overhead gives off an eerie light, making it seem
like shadows play amongst the rippling blades of silver and green.
Behind you, the woods grow tall, branches like fingers reaching up to the
star filled sky, while below the flat plain moves like something alive as
the wind pushes through the fields.  Far off behind you, you hear the
howl of the coyote, and as you turn your head the whisper of an owl's
wings reach your ears as a ghostly form swoops across the clearing.

more cautious.  You wonder if you should rest here to prepare for 
what may be in store, or press onwards.

The wooded path you have been following ends abruptly in a small

it, and as you enter the small area, you notice the entrance to a
cave behind some bushes.  Every creak your armor makes seems
louder than ever as you try to move silently onwards.

As you crouch down through the entrance to the cave, you find it
widens rapidly into a much larger place than you expected.  The
sound of trickling water plays in your ears, and the scuffle of
small feet echos around you.  You squint and hold your light
higher, trying to see into the thick darkness ahead, but to no avail.

entering this miserable cave, its faint light barely filling the

to find another exit.  You know there has to be one somewhere!

A dusty lane through the camp~
You find yourself standing on a dusty pathway winding through a
small camp.  The cave to the north is barely visible behind some
shrubs, while to the south you can hear the sound of a river.

A dusty lane through the camp~
You wander along a dusty path through the camp, wondering where
everybody is hiding.  A small shack is to the north, while the
pathway continues onward.  Perhaps they're all down at the river.

The end of a dusty laneway~
The small, dusty trail you've been following ends here, to your
surprise.  The river can still be heard to the south, but the small
camp continues no further.  Its odd that there's so few people
around...

A dusty lane through the camp~
The dusty trail comes to an end, it seems that the camp isn't
very big after all.  In fact, the whole place doesn't seem to be
of much use to anyone!  Perhaps its worth exploring the tent you
can see to the north, it looks like its in good repair at least.

A small, neat vegetable garden is at the end of the laneway, rows
of assorted plants are neatly labelled and not a weed can be seen.
The plants thrive, someone must take good care of this small patch of
land.  It looks like its ready to be harvested.

The tent is quite tidy inside, everything has its place.  There is
none of the clutter you've seen in the rest of the camp, which makes
you wonder if the occupant is close by.  Rugs cover a wooden floor,
which strikes you as odd, since you are in a tent.

The ceiling in this small storage room is so low you have to

unbelievable amount of muck and clutter in here.  Rough wooden
shelves sag, threatening to cave in, broken jars hold drips of
unknown substances, all in all its quite disgusting in here.

You move swiftly along the river, wondering where it leads.  Its

where you could get ashore not far from the camp.

speed and power for such a small rivulet is.  It looks like you
might be able to bank your boat to the north-west, and to the south
it looks like the river widens.

The stable~
As you enter the stable, several horses look your way and nicker.
Long rows of box stalls are on each side of the barn, most are
occupied, with many of the horses leaning out over their half doors
to watch the world go by.  Large windows set deep in the walls let
you look out across the fields and pastures, without endangering the
horses.  The sun hangs low in the sky, casting a deep red glow across
the landscape, shadows stretching long and sharp across the fields
outside.

Your arms hurt, your hands feel raw as the sharp edges of rock

edges in the cliff face, hoping to find some grip before you fall.
As you inch your way along, you wonder what you were thinking to
put yourself in such a perilous situation.

walk through comfortably, but who would have made this place?

You continue onwards behind the waterfall, its massive weight
making you feel very small.  The low, loud rumble has deafened
you, you can barely hear it or anything else any more.  As you
stare into the water plummeting downwards, you feel oddly drawn
towards it, and you take a slow step...Shaking your head, you
break the spell, realizing it would lead to a very quick death.
Time to move on.

You find yourself standing on a tiny rock ledge, just big enough
for one person to safely stand.  As you look down, you realize you
are still very high indeed, while not far away the waterfall
crashes by.  However, the ledge is dry and solid, and much to
your surprise, you notice iron railings going up the cliff face.
In fact, it looks like an easy climb.

A large ledge provides a safe place to sit and stare at the
massive waterfall that rushes near your feet, a railing makes
a small barrier, just in case you feel that strange desire to
get too close to the rushing water.  A cave behind you strikes
you as unusual, and you're not sure, but there might be a rumble
that is different from the rumble of the waterfall...
Just ever so slightly different...

A cave overlooking the waterfall~
The mouth of the cave opens up into a huge cavern, so large its 
surprising it hasn't collapsed.  The walls glitter and points of
light flash in a multitude of different colours, as you look closer
you realize crystals and gemstones are the source.  The beauty in
here is breathtaking!  Great fires are built within frosted glass
enclosures on the walls, the light transforming the cave into a
flickering realm of shadows pierced by the bright refractions of
the cut gems embedded in the walls.  The only thing at odds with
the place is a strange statue standing in an alcove, you think
perhaps its a mistake, and take a closer look.

alcove statue~
As you peer more closely into the alcove, you realize your first
impressions were right.  A strangely hideous form is sculpted here,
out of some blackened and charred substance.  It isn't a skeleton,
but a statue... strangely enough, of a dragon.  Its wings are
twisted back as though blown by a fierce gale, far more than should
be possible, its grim face is contorted by what looks like anger and
pain.  The eyes glower fiercely from below a deep brow, they are
the only thing not black, but glitter with a deep, silver light.
~

dragon~
As you peer more closely at the blackened, twisted form of
the dragon, you notice an inscription around the pedestal
it stands upon.  You bend closer, and read:
 
  "Betrayer and betrayed, I will fight no more,
   My heart is weary, my soul is lost
   I grieve for the memory of what is past.
 
   I will remain, I will survive, for in me
   the memory lives on.  Betrayer and betrayed,
   I may wish for the freedom of death, but I will live.
 
   As long as I remain, the past will be preserved,
   Ever remembered, never forgotten
   As long as I am here to defend the memory."

The tunnel widens, and an incredible sight stops you in your
tracks.  Massive carved gates flank an impossibly huge opening
in the rock, runes set in silver adorn the walls and floor.  You
cautiously step around the writings, not knowing what they say,
hoping that you do not trigger an unknown trap.
 
A small sign hangs on the door, it reads as follows:
      City closed for renovations.
      Please watch for our re-opening

The Lair~
The glitter of fine gems and gold attracts your attention almost
immediately....almost.  What does attract your immediate attention
is the rather large dragon curled up in the giant cavern.  Great,
sad eyes meet yours, eyes that contain the wisdom of ages, and the
beast seems to bear some distant resemblance to the statue in the
outer cave.  Still, you get the feeling it would not be wise to
remain, it is an unsafe practice to rely on the temperment of a
dragon to be the same from one moment to the next.

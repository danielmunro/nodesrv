he wind here is absolutely quiet and the sun is shining warmly 
upon you. From under the cloud you can hear the faint sounds of 
Midgaard. Right before you to the north lies the gates to the 
grand Mansion of Naris, the residence of the Greater God Redferne.

The Southern end of the hall~
You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
the pleasant feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
looking leather arm-chairs adorn the center of the library together with
a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
west wall.

You see a large world map stretch out on the enormous globe. It has towns
drawn in every spot available for such. In the middle of the map you can
spot a large town with the name 'MIDGAARD' written over it. The rest is
mountains, woods, plains and water.
~
E
midgaard town city~
You see a small speck with woods on the west from it, plains to the east
from it and mountains to the north from it. To the south from it you can
see a thin trail lead to a large castle. Finally you notice a rather large
river pour in from the east and go through Midgaard in the middle.

On the carriage path~
The path beneath your feet consists of two wagon ruts 
running through the clouds.  Looking off the sides of 
the path, you can see through occasional holes in the 
clouds all the way down to Park Road below you.  Be 
careful leaning over the holes though, not many beings 
could survive a fall from this high.

The Mighty Chain of Naris~
This place offers a splendid view of the WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE!!! A magnificent
light shines upon you and the way up through the clouds is opened. Up there
you can now see the Mansion of Naris, Residence of the Greater God Redferne.
The chain beneath you seems to evaporate in the mustering clouds that
surround you by now.

A Right Turn in the Path~
The path makes a lazy turn to the right.  Now the buildings
behind the mansion are easier to see.  The larger of the two
appears to be some sort of hall or theater.  People mill about
in front of the hall, dressed in the finest clothing you've ever
seen.  It's obviously some sort of party.

The closer you get, the more massive this hall appears to be.
White columns support the balconies on the front, where ladies
stand gossiping and waving to people below.  You begin to hear
faint sounds of music, clapping, and laughing.  Yep, its a party
alright, and where there's a party, there's food and wine.

The path makes a circle in front of the hall, before continuing
on behind it.  The front doors of the hall are open, and you can
hear the music very clearly now.  Nearby, a group of men stand
around talking politics and smoking pipes and cigars.  As the
conversation grows louder, you can tell some of the men are
getting a little uncomfortable.  Perhaps they'll let you
join thier conversation?

the Grand Staircase, which leads to an upper loft around the

Two young servants work quickly and dutifully, checking
coats, cloaks, hats, gloves, and weapons.  There are two
closets, one on each side of the room, and each entrance
is blocked by a large curtain embroidered with pictures
telling of Redferne's bravery and power. You wonder how these 
two can keep up with so many guests and their belongings,
as they aren't giving any receipts or writing anything 
down.  There is a sign on the wall.

From its highly varnised hardwood dance floor to the gold 
velvet curtains and overdone crystal chandeliers, you can 
tell Redferne must have a great deal of wealth.  The walls
must be gold plated as they shine so brightly.  Couples whirl
about the dancefloor in time with the orchestra playing in
the far corner of the room.  People mingle up and down the
Grand Staircase, and around the balcony inside the hall.
It looks like their could be rooms up on the second floor.
The music is so sweeping, you catch yourself patting your
foot and swaying in time.

looks much safer.  Or, you could stick around and teach some

Ahh, finally, close to the orchestra.  Somehow, this doesn't
seem like the beautiful music you heard when you first got here.
The string players are madly sawing sawing away on their instruments
with their bows while the brass seem to be in a musical argument 
with the woodwinds.  The percussion decided to take a break a few
minutes ago, and no one is quite sure where they went.  Who on
earth wrote this music?  Someone has got to put a stop to this,
but who to whack first...the conductor?  the principal violinist?
Or maybe you should just move on and get some refreshment from that
waiter over there...

you can admire the entire ballroom in all its splendor.  Now you
can see there are rooms all around the balcony, as well as small
groupings of furniture where party guests have gathered to talk
and drink.  People pass in and out of the rooms, but the doors 
stay closed.  Below you, on the dance floor, all you can see is
a mass of swirling skirts and spinning couples trying to keep
up with the unique music poured out by the orchestra.  Hmmm..

Cigar smoke everwhere!  
Crouching down, you're able to see the reason for all 
the smoke.  Seven men sit around a table playing cards.  
Perhaps they were dressed well when they arrived, but 
its obvious they are serious about the cards. Ties have
been loosened, jackets discarded, and sleeves rolled up.
From the looks of intense concentration, it wouldn't be 
wise to disturb them right now.  Best just to back away 
slowly and quietly close the door.

very private moment for these two, and now you're going

appearance of a gallery.  Some are portraits of 
people, some landscapes, and some are still life
works of art.  The walls are dark wood but it still
feels very bright.  There are doors to the east
and west, or you can continue down the to the North
end of the hall.

The Gaming Room~
A large billiard table stands in the middle of the room.  A rack on the wall
holds at least 30 cues.  Smaller tables are around the perimeter 
with chess boards, cards, cribbage boards, and other games.
A window in the east wall looks out over the clouds.

The North End of the Hall~
The hall continues with the theme of portraits and paintings
on the wall, with the same dark wood behind it all.  Light shines
from under the door to the north, giving you hope that
you wont be in darkness much longer.  There are also doors to the
west and the east, or you can go back the way you came.

The Librarian's Room~
A collection of books like that would need a full
time librarian, and this is his room.  It is sparce but neat.
A small bed is against the west wall, with worn
blankets and a small pillow.  Over the bed is a window
with just simple blinds.  A dresser and wardrobe
line the south wall, and on the north wall is a small
writing desk and chair.  You get the impression
he doesn't spend much time in here, and when he does
it is simply to sleep or dress.

The Solarium~
This room is quite a contrast from the rest of the mansion.
Floor to ceiling windows fill the north wall.Tropical plants, 
palms, and yukka fill large pots and reach to the ceiling 
threatening to break through it they are so tall.  Lounge 
chairs are evenly placed in a row facing the immense windows.
The view from here is incredible.  Instead of lawn for miles,
all you can see is clouds.  The occasional break in them just
shows more of Midgaard below.  In the distance, you can see
the Grand Ballroom.

The Dark Staircase~
You'd better leave the door open a crack, it is pitch black in here.
There is a small landing, then the stairs begin winding down in a spiral.
Halfway down, you cannot see behind you or infront of you.  
Be careful not to trip

On the Dark Stairway~
Dark....very very dark in here.  What little light coming from
your lightsource dies quickly in the opressive
darkness.  It's so dark you can feel it.  The treads of the
steps are very thin, so be careful you don't trip.  It's worse
to fall down in the dark than to just fall down.

At the Bottom of the Dark Stairs~
Finally, you've reached a flat area wide enough for two
people.  You can see light coming through the cracks
around a door to the south.  You hear murmerings of strange
incantations from behind the doors.

Naris' Workroom~
What an evil room.  Down to the bottom of your bowels, you realize
this is no place for any mortal.  Pots of dark red blood
sit around a black table with grooves that drip into
the pots.  A large fireplace, big enough for a person fills every wall
with a large fire blazing in each of them.  Over the fireplaces
are shelves full of jars of insects and plants.  Each one
labled in neat but unreadable script.  A lecturn stands
at the head of the black table, with a book written in the same script
as the jars.

Goodbye cruel world!~
Ooooppsss.  Someone should have told you about that
break-away railing Redferne had installed for theatrical purposes.
Alas, there is no padding awaiting you on the floor. 
You're sure gonna feel that in the morning, if you survive the fall.

A Dead End~
A small dirt path comes to an end here as thick dense thorn bushes
come to a half circle around the end of the path. The forest is far
too dense to move through, and it seems there is nowhere else to go.

A Secret Path~
It seems that a there was a way through those bushes after all! A small
dirt path winds southward here, and in the distance a strange town can
be seen. It appears to have a large overcast above it, and a spire like
castle can bearly be made out. The forest around you is very dense and
cannot be pushed through.

A Small Dirt Path~
A small dirt path has been trampled hard here. It seems to tavel almost
perfect north to south. A Dark overcast is starting to loom above you.
The forest around you sounds very much alive, and seems very dense.
The town south of here is starting to become a little more clear, and
the tall spires of the castle farther down can now be made out.

On a Rolling Hill~
You stand on the top of a rolling hill, overlooking what appears to be
a large dark city. Beyond the city you can now see in full view a large
black spired castle. A heavy cloud cover looms above you and rolling
thunder can be heard from within. The sounds of the city are now quite
loud. You can venture south to the city or back north up the path.

Before the City Gates~
Before you stands two huge ebony gates. A long wall attaches to either
side of the guard post. The clouds are now so thick that you can bearly
tell night from day. No birds or animals can be heard from the forest
now, only the sounds of the bustling city. On the left gate there is
a small golden plaque. You may either enter the city, or go back to
the forest north of here.

Within the City Gate~
The sound of the gates closing behind you echos loudly underneath
the stone archway. The large ebony gates glisten in the dim light.
Underneath the archway it is almost totally dark. The lights of the
city let off a dull glow before you.

Inside Ravencroft~
Before you is the magestic and magical city of Ravencroft. A dark 
overcast hangs in the sky here and the only true light is that of the
city lights. Center Way is to your south and Cobble St. runs east and
west through here. The large spire-like castle can now be seen in all
of it's glory from here.

Town Square~
Before you is town square. Main St. and Center Way intersect here.
Several citizens of Ravencroft mull about here. A large fountain gushes
loudly in the center, and a few merchants stand around it, trying to
sell their wears. The grand tower can be seen once again in it's entirity
looming high above you. Center Way runs north and south through here,
while Main St. runs east and west.

Inside a Guard Station~
Stepping inside the Guardstation your eyes take a momment to adjust.
Torches and weapon wacks line both walls. Two single slit windows are on
either side of you. Only a small curtain partitions the doors behind and
infront of you. It would be best to keep on the move before the guards wake

You are standing in the main guard tower above the northern gate of
Ravencroft. Several slit windows for archers line both sides of the 
walls Several weapon racks hang on the wall or stand in the corner.
The soft light of torches shines an eerie glow over the inside of the
room. A small hatch leads down to the main gate. It appears as though
the guards have been preparing for battle. All the weapons have been
readied for the field.

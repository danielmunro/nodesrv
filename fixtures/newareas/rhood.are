The box is made of iron, and is very old.  It is firmly attached to the floor
by unknown and unseen means.  The mists are so thick that you cannot see it,
regardless of how close you get to it.  Bending over a box doesn't feel very
safe in these caverns anyway.

A few strategically placed lanterns keep this place well-lit in the 
absence of any windows.  The room is surprisingly well appointed with  
tapestries hanging on the walls.  You'd wager your life the moneylender's
guards are behind them, as there are none here.  The moneylender himself
works from behind a large desk, no doubt holding a fortune in gold and silver.
A smallish sign hangs on the wall, lettered in common.

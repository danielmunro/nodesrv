Climbing The Knotted Rope~
Bravely you climb the knotted rope and hope you don't fall. The leaves
above you conceal wherever this rope leads to. Higher and higher you climb
with the ground getting further and further away. The rope groans slightly
from your weight. It doesn't seem like it has been used for quite awhile.
If you think your strength and bravery will hold out till you reach the top
keep climbing up or you can chicken out and go back down before gravity 
helps you down.

Apparently not many children brave the climb from the looks of it.
Nettles off the trees are scattered over the floor and undisturbed
dirt lightly spread about. The floor creaks as you walk around the
room exploring but it seems perfectly safe. A large opening in the
wall for a window is perfect to peruse the scenery. Looking out you
can see all around the zoo through a large opening in the branches.

You walk down the road at a very slight decline. The path twists and
turns around trees and small natural waterfalls. They took great care
when building this zoo not to disturb the natural beauty of the area.
Small bridges cross sparkling streams. Every twist and turn in the path
bring new surprises. It's a good thing there are signs to help you on
your way or you might end up where you shouldn't be. The beauty of the
place is profound but it is hard to see what is around the next bend.

You walk down the road at a very slight decline. The path twists and
turns around trees and small natural waterfalls. They took great care
when building this zoo not to disturb the natural beauty of the area.
Small bridges cross sparkling streams. Every twist and turn in the path
bring new surprises. It's a good thing there are signs to help you on
your way or you might end up where you shouldn't be. The beauty of the
place is profound but it is hard to see what is around the next bend.

Table and benches take up most of the space, and\na small food preparation area is set off to one side. Smoke forms from all the\ncooking, but is sucked away up a well constructed metal chimnet. People are\nseated at their chosen tables, enjoying the meals prepared here. Two large\nwindows are unshuttered, and show a loves view of the sea. This seems like a\ngreat place to sit and enjoy a meal and praise the fishermen for a fish well\ncaught. A bell tolls outside and the people around you stop what they are doing\nto bow their heads in a moments silence before continuing. The only exit leads\nEast, back to Fisherman's Way.\n~\n0 0 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5632\nS\n#5638\nOfcol Wharf~\nThe wharf underfoot is solid as you step off the main road. The planks\nthat make up the medium sized wharf are fitted with perfection, and no\ntrace of fish entrails or any sign that fish were cleaned and gutted \nremains. You hear the lapping of the water up against the wharf supports\nbelow. Currently no boats are moored against the wharf, obviously the\ncatch is good, and the time is right. A couple wharf workers are ambling\nabout, possibly waiting for the next boat to arrive before they can begin\ntheir tasks.

A crab scuttles\nacross your path, eyeing you before scutting back under the wharf. It seems\nthis port teems with sealife, a marvel. A large swell knocks the poles of\nthe wharf under you, creating a slight spray which moistens your face. A\ncouple wharf workers are sitting with their feet dangling off the edge of the\nwharf, another dozes on the grass to the back of the stockhouse. The wharf\ncontinues south, before coming to an end at a great white wall from one of the\nestates. The wall goes straight down and meets with the sea, before being\nsubmerged, its base somewhere beneath the ocean debths.\n~\n0 0 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5638\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5640\nS\n#5640\nOfcol Wharf~\nYou have walked along the southern part of the wharf and come to an abrubt\nend at a great white wall. The wall spams roughly twenty feet high, dwarfing\nthe surrounding port houses. To your left you see the well, obviously used\nto provide fresh water to the port villagers. A boy sits on the edge of the\nwharf, wooden rod in his hand, trying his luck for the catch.

In a sudden\nrush, people move past you west, firther along the wharf, you can hear\na commotion up ahead, but too many people no block your way.

To your surprise you see the most beautiful woman swimming amongst the\nswells. Suddenly her head goes underwater and a green shimmering tail whips\nwater towards you. She giggles and dissapears underwater before re-emerging.\nThe only exit is east.\n~\n0 0 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5641\nS\n#5643\nOfcol Wharf~\nYou continue northwards along the wooden deck of the wharf.

Water hisses and splashes\nagainst the rocks below, causing an everlasting haze of salt water in the\nair over the wharf end.

All the fish that\nhas been salted and packed for travelling is here. You imagine that since\nthe merchant kept the key for this room that he is in fact in charge of the\ndistribution of the fish stock. The stench is almost unbearable, but despite\nthe smell the room is kept clean, the floors spotless, except for straw filled\nboxes awaiting their next fishloads.

A homespun rug underfoot and a fireplace set against the far\nwall give the room a warm feel. Above the fireplace an oil painting depicting\nthe Almighty graces the wall. To your left stand a simple bed, and next to it \na small wooden dressing table. The only light comes from a candle upon the \nmantle above the fireplace.

Rows of plants line the area to your right, and you guess that\nthe priests grow their own vegetable to complement the endless supply of\nfish. The church is a large single story house, with nothing showing it as\na church, except the small belltower atop the roof. This seems like a humble\nplace for a humble people. The priests tending their grass and plants have\ncontent expressions on their faces, and they greet you as you enter their\nhome.

A man stand behind an old wooden desk, sawing a \nlong length of wood, a boy stand further behind him holding up the other end\nof the plank. The back of the house opens out onto the wharf, where you see\nwood piled up and tools set up to help the boatbuilder.

Old scrolls line a wooden shelf to your\nright, and jars containing unknown liquids rest atop another set of shelves\ntucked away in the corner to your left. Old sharks teeth, clean of any meat\nhang from the ceiling, some still attached to the jaws. Home-made fishing\npoles are stacked below the display counter in front of you.

People are\nseated at their chosen tables, enjoying the meals prepared here. Two large\nwindows are unshuttered, and show a loves view of the sea. This seems like a\ngreat place to sit and enjoy a meal and praise the fishermen for a fish well\ncaught. A bell tolls outside and the people around you stop what they are doing\nto bow their heads in a moments silence before continuing.

You hear the lapping of the water up against the wharf supports\nbelow. Currently no boats are moored against the wharf, obviously the\ncatch is good, and the time is right.

A homespun rug underfoot and a fireplace set against the far\nwall give the room a warm feel. Above the fireplace an oil painting depicting\nthe Almighty graces the wall. To your left stand a simple bed, and next to it \na small wooden dressing table. The only light comes from a candle upon the \nmantle above the fireplace.

Rows of plants line the area to your right, and you guess that\nthe priests grow their own vegetable to complement the endless supply of\nfish. The church is a large single story house, with nothing showing it as\na church, except the small belltower atop the roof. This seems like a humble\nplace for a humble people. The priests tending their grass and plants have\ncontent expressions on their faces, and they greet you as you enter their\nhome. There is a door to the East which leads into the old church.\n~\n0 0 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5622\nS\n#5630\nThe Mending Way~\nFollowing the sounds of sawing, you make your way into a medium sized house.\nThe walls are white like the rest of the houses you have seen, but in here\nthere is alot of activity. A man stand behind an old wooden desk, sawing a \nlong length of wood, a boy stand further behind him holding up the other end\nof the plank. The back of the house opens out onto the wharf, where you see\nwood piled up and tools set up to help the boatbuilder. The sawing continues.\nYou can head west out onto the wharf through the shop, or you can go back\nEast onto Fisherman's Way.\n~\n0 0 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5625\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5646\nS\n#5631\nFisherman's Way~\nThe exotic stone road takes you further along Fisherman's Way.

To\nyour right stretches a patch of grass, which follows Fisherman's Way to the\nend, where a small house can be seen before the road seems to end at the\nrocks jutting from the ground.

A wooden awning hangs over the front of the house and an old\nlady sits beneath is, in the shade, on a wooden chair. She gives a start as\nshe notices you, but her surprise turns into a warm smile. A table stands\nagainst the outside wall, displaying packed fish of various species.

Shells of various shapes, colour and size are displayed amongst\nglowing pearls, and pearl necklaces. Old scrolls line a wooden shelf to your\nright, and jars containing unknown liquids rest atop another set of shelves\ntucked away in the corner to your left. Old sharks teeth, clean of any meat\nhang from the ceiling, some still attached to the jaws. Home-made fishing\npoles are stacked below the display counter in front of you.

Table and benches take up most of the space, and\na small food preparation area is set off to one side. Smoke forms from all the\ncooking, but is sucked away up a well constructed metal chimnet. People are\nseated at their chosen tables, enjoying the meals prepared here. Two large\nwindows are unshuttered, and show a loves view of the sea. This seems like a\ngreat place to sit and enjoy a meal and praise the fishermen for a fish well\ncaught. A bell tolls outside and the people around you stop what they are doing\nto bow their heads in a moments silence before continuing.

You hear the lapping of the water up against the wharf supports\nbelow. Currently no boats are moored against the wharf, obviously the\ncatch is good, and the time is right. A couple wharf workers are ambling\nabout, possibly waiting for the next boat to arrive before they can begin\ntheir tasks.

A\ncouple wharf workers are sitting with their feet dangling off the edge of the\nwharf, another dozes on the grass to the back of the stockhouse.

The planks\nthat make up the medium sized wharf are fitted with perfection, and no\ntrace of fish entrails or any sign that fish were cleaned and gutted \nremains. You hear the lapping of the water up against the wharf supports\nbelow. Currently no boats are moored against the wharf, obviously the\ncatch is good, and the time is right. A couple wharf workers are ambling\nabout, possibly waiting for the next boat to arrive before they can begin\ntheir tasks. The wharf continues in all directions, except East.\n~\n0 0 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5643\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5626\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5639\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5641\nS\n#5639\nOfcol Wharf~\nYou continue southwards along the wooden deck of the wharf. A crab scuttles\nacross your path, eyeing you before scutting back under the wharf. It seems\nthis port teems with sealife, a marvel. A large swell knocks the poles of\nthe wharf under you, creating a slight spray which moistens your face. A\ncouple wharf workers are sitting with their feet dangling off the edge of the\nwharf, another dozes on the grass to the back of the stockhouse. The wharf\ncontinues south, before coming to an end at a great white wall from one of the\nestates. The wall goes straight down and meets with the sea, before being\nsubmerged, its base somewhere beneath the ocean debths.\n~\n0 0 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5638\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5640\nS\n#5640\nOfcol Wharf~\nYou have walked along the southern part of the wharf and come to an abrubt\nend at a great white wall. The wall spams roughly twenty feet high, dwarfing\nthe surrounding port houses. To your left you see the well, obviously used\nto provide fresh water to the port villagers. A boy sits on the edge of the\nwharf, wooden rod in his hand, trying his luck for the catch.

In a sudden\nrush, people move past you west, firther along the wharf, you can hear\na commotion up ahead, but too many people no block your way.

To your surprise you see the most beautiful woman swimming amongst the\nswells. Suddenly her head goes underwater and a green shimmering tail whips\nwater towards you. She giggles and dissapears underwater before re-emerging.\nThe only exit is east.\n~\n0 0 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5641\nS\n#5643\nOfcol Wharf~\nYou continue northwards along the wooden deck of the wharf.

Water hisses and splashes\nagainst the rocks below, causing an everlasting haze of salt water in the\nair over the wharf end.

Table and benches take up most of the space, and\na small food preparation area is set off to one side. Smoke forms from all the\ncooking, but is sucked away up a well constructed metal chimnet. People are\nseated at their chosen tables, enjoying the meals prepared here. Two large\nwindows are unshuttered, and show a loves view of the sea. This seems like a\ngreat place to sit and enjoy a meal and praise the fishermen for a fish well\ncaught. A bell tolls outside and the people around you stop what they are doing\nto bow their heads in a moments silence before continuing. The only exit leads\nEast, back to Fisherman's Way.\n~\n0 0 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 5632\nS\n#5638\nOfcol Wharf~\nThe wharf underfoot is solid as you step off the main road. The planks\nthat make up the medium sized wharf are fitted with perfection, and no\ntrace of fish entrails or any sign that fish were cleaned and gutted \nremains. You hear the lapping of the water up against the wharf supports\nbelow. Currently no boats are moored against the wharf, obviously the\ncatch is good, and the time is right. A couple wharf workers are ambling\nabout, possibly waiting for the next boat to arrive before they can begin\ntheir tasks.

A crab scuttles\nacross your path, eyeing you before scutting back under the wharf. It seems\nthis port teems with sealife, a marvel. A large swell knocks the poles of\nthe wharf under you, creating a slight spray which moistens your face. A\ncouple wharf workers are sitting with their feet dangling off the edge of the\nwharf, another dozes on the grass to the back of the stockhouse. The wharf\ncontinues south, before coming to an end at a great white wall from one of the\nestates.

A boy sits on the edge of the\nwharf, wooden rod in his hand, trying his luck for the catch.

In a sudden\nrush, people move past you west, firther along the wharf, you can hear\na commotion up ahead, but too many people no block your way.

To your surprise you see the most beautiful woman swimming amongst the\nswells. Suddenly her head goes underwater and a green shimmering tail whips\nwater towards you.

All the fish that\nhas been salted and packed for travelling is here. You imagine that since\nthe merchant kept the key for this room that he is in fact in charge of the\ndistribution of the fish stock. The stench is almost unbearable, but despite\nthe smell the room is kept clean, the floors spotless, except for straw filled\nboxes awaiting their next fishloads.

A homespun rug underfoot and a fireplace set against the far\nwall give the room a warm feel. Above the fireplace an oil painting depicting\nthe Almighty graces the wall. To your left stand a simple bed, and next to it \na small wooden dressing table. The only light comes from a candle upon the \nmantle above the fireplace.

Rows of plants line the area to your right, and you guess that\nthe priests grow their own vegetable to complement the endless supply of\nfish. The church is a large single story house, with nothing showing it as\na church, except the small belltower atop the roof. This seems like a humble\nplace for a humble people. The priests tending their grass and plants have\ncontent expressions on their faces, and they greet you as you enter their\nhome.

A man stand behind an old wooden desk, sawing a \nlong length of wood, a boy stand further behind him holding up the other end\nof the plank. The back of the house opens out onto the wharf, where you see\nwood piled up and tools set up to help the boatbuilder.

Old scrolls line a wooden shelf to your\nright, and jars containing unknown liquids rest atop another set of shelves\ntucked away in the corner to your left. Old sharks teeth, clean of any meat\nhang from the ceiling, some still attached to the jaws. Home-made fishing\npoles are stacked below the display counter in front of you.

People are\nseated at their chosen tables, enjoying the meals prepared here. Two large\nwindows are unshuttered, and show a loves view of the sea. This seems like a\ngreat place to sit and enjoy a meal and praise the fishermen for a fish well\ncaught. A bell tolls outside and the people around you stop what they are doing\nto bow their heads in a moments silence before continuing.

You hear the lapping of the water up against the wharf supports\nbelow. Currently no boats are moored against the wharf, obviously the\ncatch is good, and the time is right.

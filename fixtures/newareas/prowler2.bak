High Above Emerald Forest~
Tranquil sounds of trickling streams, birds chirping and the
russeling of leaves encourages you to scurry down the tree to
explore this new found paradise.

Top Of The Tree~
From the top of this tree the view is breathtaking.  To the
north you see a forest rich in color.  A small funnel of smoke
is rising from within the forest, perhaps a campfire.  From one
branch you see a very thin vine, stretched across to the next
tree.  And it looks like theres a pathway at the bottom of that
tree.

Bottom Of The Big Tree~
Through the dense bush, you hear twigs snaping and giggles in
the distance.  Squinting your eyes trying to focus on the figures
you think you see in the distance proves futile.  As you search 
around for an easier way into the bush, you decide you need a
better view.

A Shady Forest~
Birds chirp and a light breeze ruffles the leaves on the trees.
The Maple, Oak and Birch trees make great homes for the local
wildlife. Squirrels, rabbits and who knows what else could live
here quite happily.

web~
A huge cobweb is strung between two trees to the east.  It must
be 8 feet wide by 10 feet high.  Skeletons of dead squirrels and
other rodents are stuck to the web.  Your skin crawls at the thought
of what must have made such a spectacle.

A Path In The Shady Forest~
A path of sorts is clearly marked, but the overhanging branches
force you to hunch over.  Whoever or whatever uses this path is
obviously not very tall.  You're surrounded by dense bush and can
see little more than ten feet down the path.

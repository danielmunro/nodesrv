Before the Temple of Arachnos~
A chill runs down your spine as you look at the structure before you. It is 
obviously a great temple of some sort. You quickly notice that four legs run down 
the building on both sides. You stare at the awkward-shaped front and a cold chill
runs down your back. This temple is shaped like a spider. You suddenly become weak 
and wonder if you should continue. You notice a sign at your feet held up by various
bones. You READ THIS SIGN.

Entrance to the Temple~
You find yourself in a dark, clammy area. Your only source of light comes from the 
north and filters through a massive web constructed between 2 columns. The top disappears
above you. Peering to the left and right, you notice what looks to be a room on 
either side.  The darkness keeps you from seeing what lies within. You turn to
leave and cannot find the door. Your hand sweeps the wall. You find it difficult to remove
your hand from the wall's cold, sticky surface. Something moves behind you.

Sticky, sticky, sticky!  The ground is cluttered with leaves, decayed
remains of webbed crickets, beetle, rats, dogs (?), and even humans.
You begin to wonder about what lies ahead.  The air is damp here,
and even the little light that shines through the canopy seems
absorbed into the webbing.

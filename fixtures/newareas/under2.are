and stick-like.  It has four arm/claw appendages, with reasonably
developed pincer-hands on the two uppermost and dagger-like claws on
the two lower ones.

Chamber of Silence~
You are standing in Silence's relaxation room.  The walls are pitch black
while the floor flows from one colour to another causing weird shadows
and colours to bounce off the walls.  Against the wall is a large map.  On
the south wall stands a large window.

There are no exits from Silence's Chamber.

Corner of Wyrm Street and Sunset~
You stand in the north western corner of the Underdark.  The bustling
streets sound distant and the hum of people moving and talking barely
reaches your ears.  The only light in this section of the city comes from
your light source.  You stands against the huge cavern's walls.  Water
glints in the light on the walls.

Worm Street goes east, and Sunset goes south

North east corner on Wrym and Sunrise~
You stand in the north east corner of the city.  There is an eerie calm here,
muffled echoes bounce off the cavern walls and into your ear.  You can
hear the screams of the slave, the talking of adventurers.  The cavern walls
loom up to the east and north of you.  You light doesn't even illuminate up
to the ceiling.  Darkness surrounds you.  The ground is hard and grey.  The
walls are grey, and glint with wetness.  You wish you could recall to
Midgaard, but alas, that is impossible.

You stand on Moonlight avenue, thinking the name is a cruel joke on
surface dwellers for you wish you could see the moon, not the continuous
darkness that lives in this city.  Everywhere darkness creeps, even with the
lights that adorn some of the streets, it is still dark. To your east lies the
entrance to a dark building and it see to just disappear into the night.  The
door seems to be rusted shut.

North and south moonlight continues, east is the door.

North end of sunset~
You stand almost in the very north west corner of the city.  The streets up
here are not as used as those towards the centre of the city.  To the south
you see some of the dwellings of the creatures that inhabit this gloomy
city.  There is nothing of note that you can see here, but then again it could
just be the darkness that lies just beyond your insignificant circle of light.

Sunset~
You wonder who it was that named these dreadful streets such cheery
names.  The street upon which you stand is nothing like sunset, the only
reason you can even think up is the fact that sunset if on the west side of
the city.  Screams echo towards you from all sides assaulting your senses. 
You eyes hurt from trying to pierce the darkness that lies everywhere.  The
ground is rough through your boots.  The air is cool, and the cavern wall to
your west glints with wetness.

orb flickers on and off.

dark blue rock.  The house, if that is what it is, seems to be very dark with
no windows.  The house stretches to the east and west.  The walls are very
smooth and glint in your light.  The entrance is to the north.

Ruby Street~
You stand on Ruby street, one of the streets of gems.  You heard a voice
while walking through the Underdark that these streets were named so
because they were once veins of gems.  The were hollowed out after years
of struggle leaving tunnels all over this area, a mage cast a very powerful
spell and created this section of the cavern.  The air is stuffy and moist
here.

You stand on sapphire street just before a tavern.  A ball of light floats out
of your reach above you.  It illuminates a sign that says 'The Gemstone.' 
The door has been painted many different colours, you figure they were
trying to catch the colours of all the gems.  From behind the door you can
make out bits and pieces of conversation.

that there are little glowing balls of light above your head illuminating the
street somewhat.

that you know fills the whole cavern seems to press down on you.  The
street sparkles in the vague light.

heard that these streets got their names because they were once large veins
of gems in the cavern.  You don't know if this is true, but the floor glitters
as if it were covered in diamonds.

really fear of being attacked from the east, but some of the shadows on
your western side seem menacing, anything could be hiding in them.

these famous stones.  It was along this road that the city was made. 
Without the slave trade, the city would not have expanded as fast as it did
when the city was first built.  The Underdark has since become a trade
centre where those who dwell beneath the ground and those above can
interact in relative safety.

true by all the screams of pain and horror that seem to come from all

themselves.  Above your head are small floating orbs that bathe the street
with a dim light.

is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people. but also agonized screams.  The shadows seems to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark.

of the shadows.  Somehow the sounds of the city do not invade this place
so it is quiet enough to discuss without shouting.  The square is basically
clear but the dimness makes it impossible to see farther than 10 feet, thus
making it perfect for meetings of a discrete manner.  It seems as if some
orbs have stopped working.

North is the Slaver's Route, the meeting place continues east and south

The Gathering Place~
You stand at the north east corner of the gathering place.  Around you is a
mist that seems to come from nothing.  The mist limits your vision to
about 7 feet in any direction.  The only sounds that reach you ears are
muffled and distorted making it impossible to understand them.  Dark
forms wander at the edge of your vision, you can't tell if it your
imagination or reality.

North is the Slaver's route, west and south the gathering place lies

this area for discrete meetings.

You are in the south east corner of the gathering place.  There are no lights
here.  The only illumination is from your light source.  No sounds reach
your ears only your breathing and the blood gushing through your body. 
Everything seems to be distance, nothing looks real.  You feel isolated
from society as a whole, ignored, worthless.  There is nothing to live for,
people whisper in the shadows, plotting the downfall of the world. 
Nothing can stop it, there is no point.  How can you as an individual make
a difference?  For a moment, these words form in the air "Welcome to the
darkside" you feel empty and drained.  No life stirs within, a chill
threatens to overcome your entire being.

The gathering place continues north and west.  To the south lies the street
of the Gods

The Slave's Square~
You are in one of the most oppressed regions of the Underdark.  It is here
that the capitalist dream has become totally realised.  The oppression and
repression of those who should be free is evident in everything that stands
in this square.  Stocks to hold the bad slaves, a guillotine to kill the slaves
that stand up for their rights.  The slaves are reduced to animals in this
square.

To the north is the Slaver's route, east and south lies the square

You are in the north east corner the slave's square.  The name is a cruel
slavers joke, they have given the slaves this square.  The square is the only
thing the slaves have, and it is used for their maiming, sentencing and
execution.  The ground is clean, with dark brown spots here and there. 
The dark brown stains are stains of blood.

future.  Some twisted mage made it possible to hear these screams.  The
smell of decaying corpses reaches your nostrils every now and then.  The
ground has dark brown stains on it.  The cruel reality of slavery can be felt
by your soul, causing is to ache to own and manipulate other beings.  You
can realise this desire to the west.

The slave's square continues north and east.  South is the street of the Gods

Sunrise~
You stand on sunrise the eastern most street in the Underdark.  The street
name is a joke on those surface dwellers who may crave the sun.  Sunrise
travels along the eastern cavern wall.  The Underdark is a huge city
compared to midgaard.  The city that was founded has grown to fill the
cavern and thrives in the dark.  Over half the people who live here can see
in the dark, the floating orbs were placed for the surface dwellers so they
could kinda see.

sounds of the city bounce of the cavern wall to the east and find their way
into your ears.  The smell of sweat engages your nose.  A dark forbidding
enters your head, the shadows begin to come alive.  Always, just out of
your sight, a shape flits in and out of the shadows.

agonized cries and the hum of thousands talking indicate that this is a huge
city.  Built in the recent past, the city has undergone major growth and
now is about 2 times larger than Midgaard.  This is the meeting place of
the rogues and thieves from the world of sun and moon and those who
dwell beneath the earth.

fighting on the streets.  The only reason there is no fighting is that fact that
huge guardian eyes float through the city preventing open fights.  Glowing
orbs float in the air, casting their dim glow on all around.  Illuminating
basically nothing but giving some light.

their lives.  You wonder if the voices you hear are from the past, the
present or the future.  Some mages in this city have twisted tastes and have
cast spells to allow you to hear the past, the present and the future.

Street of the Gods, Silence~
You are standing at the western edge of the city just before the cavern
wall.  The buzz of the people is almost non-existent here.  This part of the
city like most of the city isn't very well lit.  A solitary glowing orb floats
casting a thin circle of light on the ground.  As with all sections of this
street, this part has been dedicated to a god, Silence.  As soon as you
realise this, you understand why this section of the city is so quiet. A statue
of a githzerai seems to be kneeling to a statue of Silence.

To the North lies an entrance to a house, east the street goes onwards

were enslaved by the mind flayers, there they were scarred for all eternity.
The githzerai is human in height and weight.  Most githzerai are strong,
and very capable with mental powers.  This statue is very lifelike, and it's
eyes seem to glow in the weird lighting of the orb.~ 
E
statue silence~
This is a statue of the god of agility and speed.  He is dressed totally in a
black ninja outfit.  In one hand he wields a tiger's claw the other hand
seems to glow.  You tap the hand and no sound comes out.  On pedestal
there is a note that reads

    Silence is both provider and destroyer, to be blessed by him is to           
be blessed indeed.

You take one final look at this impressive almost life like representation of
Silence and notice that it's eyes glow purple and seem to be watching your
every move.

night.  On the ground are seem to be  a series of confusing symbols which
you presume are mystic symbols of some sort.

is clean, the shadows are darker than they should be and whisper of
assassins.  The lighting cast from the orbs is not white, it's cobalt blue.

it was crafted for.  The blackness of the obsidian is so deep that it
causes your light to be absorded dimming the street.

Street of the Gods, Garth~
You stand along the street of the gods.  This section has been dedicated to
Garth.  The road here has been polished so it shines as you pass by.  The
glowing orbs seem to flicker on and off here.  You've heard stories about
Garth's love for the day lit world, maybe this space provides the access?

Street of the Gods, Varcel, before the prisons~
You are walking along the street of the gods.  It is here that the citizens of
the Underdark present their worship.  The gods of the realms have blessed
the Underdark as a whole with great karma for this ingenious way of
showing their devotion.

The street continues south and north.  To the east is the entrance to the
guardian prisons.

dedicated to the many gods of different realms of mud.  The road here has

Although different then having a temple in the city to worship the gods in,
the gods have come to accept the street.

water.  There are glowing orbs floating in the air every ten feet or so,
casting everything in a dim light, like the light of the predawn.

different precious stones.  Azurite has left it's mark on the street.  The
street still seems to be blue in colour.  The glowing orbs illuminate next to
nothing.

Road of Shadows at Sunset~
You are standing at the beginning of the road of Shadows.  The reason for
this name is very obvious.  All around you more shadows then there should
be form.  Everything seems to be cloaked in it's own shadow.  The light of
the orbs and from your light source does nothing to illuminate the area. 

Sunset goes north and south.  The road of shadows heads east. ~

you fail miserably.  The road of shadows allows straight passage from the
east side of the city to the west.  Very little lives along this street, but from

blue road of azurite is covered by a layer of shadow.  The shadows deepen
to the east and west, north and south they seem to clear up some. 

To the north and south Azurite runs, to the east and west the road of

would wander a road like this, but down here, many of the denizens of the
Underdark like the shadows thus they walk this road frequently.

East the road of shadows goes on.  West the road of shadows meet Azurite.

the light itself seems to give off shadows.  Perhaps some deranged mage
cast a huge spell along this road to give it this affect.  Whatever the reason
is, you can barely see anything around you.

You have heard rumours that a very strong group of worshippers live in
the Underdark, and you also heard that they attack any who enter their

grey, the lighting is that of being in a shadow.  The darkness here seems to
be so thick that even the noise of the city does not penetrate it.  To the
north, the darkness clears up considerably.

North is the beginning of the street of Gods.  East and west the road of
shadows stretches onwards.

entire cavern was filled with veins of gems and precious metals.  It was
first mined by the duergar who lost it to the drow.  Much later a mighty
wizard came to the area and created a huge cavern from the many tunnels. 
Where the mighty veins once were now only roads exist.

different precious stones.  Azurite has left it's mark on the street.  The

Traveller's Crescent~
You head down traveller's crescent.  No shadows lie off to the side of the
road, so there is no hidden threat (unless invisible).  The glowing orbs here
seems to flicker on and off, but even with this inconsistent lighting, the
street seems to glow with life.

of life rather than death.  Death is a part of the Underdark no matter where

Dark Tunnel~
You stand in a dark tunnel.   You light source illuminates a cleanly cut
tunnel.  You seem to be standing where it ends. On the wall you see
scribbled in blood:

Progress only if thee canst be seen or if thou art powerful 
The air is dry but cold.  The floor is even without any marks of tools.  The
walls are straight without any indication that mining tools have carved this
tunnel, only to the north are there any marks at all.

This whole section of the tunnel has been destroyed.  The ground lies in

standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks. You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals it's surface counterpart,
Midgaard.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the Underdark.  A
dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten levels of
experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a series of 
markings that you can't make out at this distance.

This is the city named the Underdark.  It was created by a crazy mage
years ago, and has prospered here below Midgaard.  For some reason, the
mage cast a mighty spell that cursed the entire city preventing people from
recalling out of it.  This makes it a perfect place to sell slaves and buy
slaves.  Although most think it as being lawless, there is a code and this
code is enforced by huge floating eyes.

Good luck,

Entry Hall~
You are standing in a large spacious hallway.  The floor is made of a
polished black marble that catches the light and disperses it around.  The
walls are made of what you think is jade, but it could just be a thin layer of
jade.  The green seems to fade to black as it goes lower to the ground. 
There is a large fur skin that lies right next to the door.  The west wall has
a small closet in it.

This is a spacious closet, with hooks and hangers to clothing.  There are

which would explain the colour.  The soft glint of your light plays on the
floor.  The floor is clean and so are the walls.  Everything is neat.  The hall
is about twenty feet wide and stretches above your head about twenty feet.

wide.  He holds a huge silver sword that glows red.  On the pedestal you

          of the githzerai.  We will win against all odds. ~

walls that seem to spring out of nowhere.  You keep hearing a knocking

while the floor remains black.  The assassins in this guild believe that their
guild home is a place of work, not for recreation and thus leave it devoid
of any decorations.  Most assassins do not live in this building, and a
bunch do not even live in the Underdark.

the head ranger~
The Head Ranger is here.
~
The Head Ranger flashes a toothed grin at you. He asks you if he can help you
with anything. You tell him that the sword he holds is awfully big for a park
ranger to have. What does he do with it, fight trees? He tells you it has a
strong protective aura about it. You decide you'd do good to have this and a
small scuffle breaks out.

park ranger~
the park ranger~
The Park Ranger welcomes you to the campgrounds.
~
A cleanly groomed woman nods in your direction. She asks you to purchase your
pass and enjoy your stay. She notices your glinting arms and informs you that
weapons are not permitted within the park due to game hunters. If you would
leave the weapons with her than she won't be forced to prohibit your entrance
and make you leave empty-handed. Angrily, you attack this woman in a fit of
rage so that you might go about your way hunting deer.

An ornery raccoon stares deep into your soul.

A rather big raccoon is here. He is extremely furry and irritated. His masked
face is wrinkled into an angry expression. He must have accidently wandered
into the restroom and decided he might as well put his paw prints all over
and rip up as much toilet paper as he can. Despite all this, he still isn't
having any fun. Perhaps you could come to his aid?

A wasted kender staggers about blindly.

This kender is pretty short. He is completly drunk to the point that he can't
recognize the fact that he should be stealing from you. At least his idea to
go camping and take a break from the kender village was a good idea. The
fresh mountain air has allowed him to build the energy to grow significantly.
He might actually pose a threat to your life flailing wildly in his drunken
stupor.

you think you sense some disdain. An extreme strength is hidden under her
innocence. You can only hope you aren't here when she snaps.

death follows this creature. He smells terrible and he doesn't look much

a yinn pack~
A pack of yinns lie here, subserviantly obeying the alpha male.
~
This group seems to be geared to do whatever their leader says. For now, they
simply avoid contact and howl at the moon. A few seem to be oddly cynical and
talkative. Reminds you of a champagne supernova.

protective of whatever he is searching for, especially for something he

Being loud and talking about a normal conversational tone may be plausible

yourself deserves any recognition is an idiot. Enough is enough.

This is the plainest and least interesting looking of all the sites around.
The ground is blackened due to ash from excessive fires. It's probably for
late entrances because it's so close to the gate. About the only good thing
this place is good for is sitting down a couple of otherwise boring people

On The C Loop~
The plants seem to sing to you as the cool winds sweep through their rustling
leaves. The C loop, continuing on to the east, is such a nice place you wish
you could just lay down and go to sleep. There's plenty more to explore, so
you better get a move on before it gets to dark.

Campsite C3~
A march of stone golems shakes the ground all around. Huge statues walk about
in a fearsome ritual dance. Just the sight makes your knees quiver. They
appear to be a deadly, dastardly bunch. Their features are great and very
chiseled. Though, the mention of a chisel might send them away in fear. For
the greatest fear of these unliving creatures seems to be their undoing.

The sound of metal clanging against metal can be heard from far off. Reaching

blacksmith is working in seclusion behind a bush while his apprentice helps

This hill is practically a nights climb, it seems to go on forever. Your
weary limbs keep pressing on however, against this steep grade. You hope this
tiring journey will be worth it when you reach the top. Did you just pass the
tree line? Uh oh, it's starting to snow at this altitude.

A Path To A Cabin~
The hill has finally levelled out. As you walk you come to a beautiful
clearing. Short grass bends beneath your feet as you walk, making you feel
as if you're walking on a cloud. Through the bushes to the south you see a
small looking cabin. The only people authorized to live up here are the park
rangers, but then again plenty of people have escaped from insane asylums
with shotgun in hand to run up to the wilderness and build a cabin to live in
as they argue with their left hand whether or not to consume or simply murder
the first living creature they see to enter their cabin.

Inside The Head Ranger's Cabin~
This room is where the Head Ranger lives. Everything he needs is right here
or can be grabbed quickly at the nearby shop. Rugs scatter the floor and
fine paintings cover the walls. The cabin has a thick woodsy feeling, as it's
built entirely of wood. You feel like sitting down on a rug and sipping some
wine. However, this isn't your home and you wouldn't want to intrude.

This campsite is somewhere inbetween a normal mid-sized human campsite and a
upscale yuppie elven campsite. The decor seems somewhat caught in the middle
of the two styles as well. A sense of magical power seems to settle all about
the sight, yet it is yin to the yang of plainness. A very unsettling feeling
fills you every where you go.

Confidently you stroll to the center of the camp circle and sway to the tunes
merrily. Suddenly your ears begin to burn incessantly. You cry out in pain
but there is nothing you can do. You try to run but the place seems to go on
forever. You can't escape the foul noise emitting from the ranger's guitar.
You look around to see that everyone else here is in the same predicament.
It seems as if time has stopped, your wounds remain and your head aches.

Tall trees surroud this private site. The fact that the site is so enclosed
swirls up the wind as it whips smells through the site. One of the more
unpleasant smell emenates from the bases of the trees all around the site.
In fact, the smell is rather familiar from the bathroom in the mud factory
back in the dregs of business life in Midgaard. A long whining howl pulls you

you can't seem to make heads or tails of them. This is probably due to the
fact that there are no clues and there is no importance to this room.

The design of this bear trap seems to be that the bear is baited in and than
trapped inside. Unfortunately for you, it seems to work too well. The trap
is quite bleak with metal showing on all sides. Scratches appear all over
the trap, especially on the door you just opened. You get one last glimpse of
the floor before you get some of those scratches on yourself. Covering the
ground is various odds and ends that the bear seems to have coughed up while
trying to escape.

the rocks abound and just take everything in. Or you can continue travelling
to the east and west along the river or head back to your site to the north.

perfect place for one to stay at night and go out hiking during the day. In
fact a trail leads directly out of this site to the west along with its
entrance from the B loop. It seems this site is very much taken as there is
a half put up tent and a table cloth in the site, but it's also very much
empty. You decide that the people that have this site went hiking off to the
west and decide that would be a pleasant thing for you to do as well.

Campsite B4~
This site is an extremely small one. It's also not very crowded. Taking up
most of the room are various odds and ends strewn about the floor, especially
alcoholic products. Unfortunetly for you, the alcohol has previously been
consumed. Perhaps, you'll get lucky and find some and then you can join the
rather dull looking party.

On The C Loop~
The plants seem to sing to you as the cool winds sweep through their rustling
leaves. The C loop, continuing on to the east, is such a nice place you wish
you could just lay down and go to sleep. There's plenty more to explore, so
you better get a move on before it gets to dark.

This site seems like a regular hang out for this guy. He must practically 
live here. His wears are actually quite good and you should take a good look
at what he's selling. You might find something for that friend's birthday
that's coming up that you may have forgotten about. Don't even think about
attempting to kill this good-natured man. The shopkeeper wouldn't like that
at all.

Campsite C5.5~
A bit wet you find yourself on land inside a nice little campsite. It seems
not too different from any other campsite except that the fireplace is oddly
smoking profusely. Wait, is it possible? Could it be? You have finally found
you campsite! Stay as long as you want, but make sure to pay for each day and
then checkout before noon. Hope you've had a pleasant trip thus far.

Campsite C7~
This campsite looks for luxurious. The dinner table is extremely clean and
new looking. The space is mind-boggling. One could easily fit as much as five
tents in this single space. It must have cost extra and gone very quickly for
this week. The fire place is expecially large. You could cook a whole meal 
for Thanksgiving in it. A huge grating sits atop the fire place. You whistle
in appreciation for this amazing site. Oddly, the grilling on the fire shakes
a bit for a while as if the sound from your whistle was amplified through it.
This site wasn't opened to stay in or else the park ranger at the entrance
would have mentioned it. Strangely, it looks quite abandoned and barren. You
wish you could put it to good use. When you're done revelling in its splendor
you can return to the west and continue searching.

In The Fire Place~
You have entered a place so hot and frightening you fear you may have taken a
wrong turn and ended up in hell. The temperature here is scalding as you
begin to melt away before your eyes. You flesh begins to drip and you cry out
in pain. Flames lick all about your body and heat radiates through every inch
of your being. It seems that a family of lashers could find some comfort here
among the heat.

Campsite C5~
This site is a rather barren place. Whoever occupies this space must not
spend too much time here as barely any of the necessary camping equipment is
stored here. A couple of broken arrow heads and flint stones litter the
ground, but beyond that, there really isn't much here. Whoever's site this is
must sure be an interesting person to meet because what ever they do, they're
devoted to it.

There's a group of them at any given time at any given campgrounds: the noisy
campers. These guys just won't shut up and you can hear them half way across
the grounds. Maybe they need to be taught a lesson in civility.

As you enter this site a rich silence envelops you. Not a whisper of leaves
lightly stirred by the wind breaks the peace. The site is as dead as the
statues which litter it. All at once the quiet is broken by the thick beat of
heavy wings against the air. Evil lurks here, powerful evil.

A Private Stall~
You have entered the private stall of the bathroom. It appears to be designed
for you to do your greatest ponderings and to promote the ideas behind
original inventions. Perhaps it has one or two other uses as well. The
storage of fine jewelry seems to be a good additional option.

Along The River~
You are on a trail alongside a beautiful and turbulent river. It swirls and
twists to the south, far too powerful for you to wade into. Grass is matted
down among the smoothed stones. The walk is very peaceful and tiring. You 
like laying down right here and going to sleep. What a sweet little river.

Just as your legs become more weary then every before your ray of light comes
to your rescue. The river to the south becomes very complacent and shallow
here. It's the perfect time the enter it and take a look around. Just as you
roll up your clothing and prepare for a dip a rough sound bellows out from
the north. It sounds like stone grinding against stone.

Below The Landslide~
The path seems to be blocked off here by a huge landslide. Rocks and boulders
surround you. You're about to turn around and head back to the river to the
south when you hear a low rumbling sound come through the rocks above. The
sound is very muffled but it remotely seems to resemble a voice. Perhaps
someone was trapped in the rocks and needs to be rescued? You should probably
go check it out.

On The River~
You are in the middle of a powerful river flowing west to east. You need to
strain every muscle in your body just to keep from plummeting down to the
east and drowning. You are getting soaked to the bone and beginning to feel
thoroughly miserable overall. It might be a good idea to go back to the nice
dry bank to the north. If you do, you can sit on a nice big mossy rock.

the river. A huge cliff to the west blocks off any passage as a waterfall
spills down. This river must be the product of melted snow as a beautifully
pristine ice blue mountain touches the sky to the west.

The view of the waterfall is even better when you're in the middle of it.
Glistening water flows rapidly all about you, explaining why the current is
not full of slow-pids. The force of the water is pulling to over the cliff,
but if you wish, you could manage to swim back against the current.

Tranquillity is at a peak here. Soft grass wafts sweet smells that blend with
the rich fragrances of wildflowers in the air here. Sounds of a beautiful
waterfall spill down from the south. You would dive right in, but you would
probably break your neck. You should probably go find a part of the river
that is safer to wade into.

The beds rest in a state of complete \nshambles, ripped to pieces by the creatures that seem to have been through\nthis house.  It is truely a desolate sight.

The rooms white marble walls are adorned with elegant\ntapestries, and a ebony and sapphire Persian rug covers the floor.\nTo the right, rays of sunlight stream through an oval stained glass\nwindow casting various shades of blue around the room. There is a\nblack marble fireplace here, in it the embers of a dying fire glow\nand hiss. An overstuffed couch sits to the left, its ebony leather\nmarbled with sapphire. It looks quite comfortable and you should\nrest for awhile.\n~\n0 CDJNPTU 0\nE\nup down north south east west~\nNothing........................\n~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 22000  15 22003  1\t* A bog

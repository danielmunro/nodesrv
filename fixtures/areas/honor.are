If it escalates, either take it  *\n*      to tells, or sit down & discuss it in the War Room.                *\n*                                                                         *\n* 4. Take time to help others.  Your clanmates, allies, and newbies are   *\n \n*      often in need.                                                     *\n*                                                                         *\n* 5. Be constructive.  If you see a problem, offer a solution.

Not only can you not\nsee but a wave of calm is passing over you, it makes you feel a little\nlight headed but still stable. Walking further into the blackness it\nslowly fades to a dim red light and you can now visualize your\nsurroundings.  The room looks carved from a single block of black marble,\nthe walls are adorned by various weapons and pieces of armour.  The room\nis lit by mystical red torches flickering in a small but cold breeze.\nAt the center of the room is a coffin made from a strange pitch black\nmetal fit with finely crafted jewels.  Around the coffin are candles that\nburn never ending and the wax drys in thick pools on the ground.  The \ncoffin and the candles sit at the center of a large blood red pentagram.\nThe room seems empty after that except for a large desk that holds many\nbooks from ages past.\n~\n0 CK 0\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 4319\nS\n#4324\nCorridors of Honor, Level 2~\nThe mazelike corridors of Honor continue on here.\nTo the South you see Tas and MoonAngels room.\n~\n0 CK 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4325\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4319\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 4327\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 4328\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4326\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 4329\nE\nwest~\nNothing special there.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nNothing special there.\n~\nS\n#4325\nSleeth's Hideout~\nYou have entered a dark room, with the ever so faint smell of\ncigarette smoke.

From the wear\nand tear you can tell that it has been used quite often.  \nYou notice an open chest of pictures and letters from Tas's past, \nsuch as his parents BloodMoon and Alucard.

From your low viewpoint, you can see an old picture\nof five people lying on the floor under the bed.  Who could they be?\nOne of them you assume to be Alanza, and the older man and woman to be her\nparents, but you can't figure out who the two boys are...\nYou decide they must be her brothers, even though you have never heard her\nspeak of them.

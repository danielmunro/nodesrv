The walls and matching\ncurtains are done in earth tones of reds and beiges.  A single, picture\nwindow reveils the breath-taking rocky rapids of the lower Ottawa river.\nYou see a single desk tucked neatly against one wall with a matching, small\nand unobtrusive book shelf beside it.  The sweet hidden flow of Beethoven's\n\"Moonlight Sonata,\" fills you with waves of harmony.\n~\n0 ACDJPSTU 0\nO bloodmoon~\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16451 0 10000\nE\nbookshelf~\nAmong the many volumes found on BloodMoon's book shelf, you find a wide\nvariety of selection.

The night sky, beautiful in it's brilliant blackness, is\nlittered with the uncountable stars and constellations above.  Fish swim in\nan antiquated fountain. The walls are covered with fine art, and the floor\ncovered with a finely woven rug, it's intricacies unimaginable.  The room\nis also full of plants.  Vines and palms of all types crowd the corners of\nthe room, growing over one another.  On one of the walls, however, there is\nno flora.  Instead, a great library, it's books arranged and covering every\ninch of the shelves.  There are tremendously old books, older than the art\nand plant life covering the other walls.  Greek, Latin, English, writings\nof every language known to man and even some that are no longer known cover\nthe shelf.  The room is nothing short of incredible.\n~\n0 CDT 0\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nO 0 10005 100 10018\t* a hole in the wall\nP 1 10008  -1 10005  1\t*   a golden heart-shaped locket\nM 0 10009   1 10077  1\t*

The smells of fresh-brewed coffee and stale cigarette smoke\nthickly in the air.  As you walk toward the long counter, your shoes stick\nslightly to the gaudy yellow and green linoleum floor.  Behind the counter\nlie racks and racks of donuts, muffins, and other wonderful treats.\nIn front of the counter are several stools, all occupied by the regular\npatrons of the shop.  Each of them has a large cup of steaming, black\ncoffee and an over-flowing ashtray in front of them.\n \nThe largest booth lies in the only dark corner.  The red vinyl covering is \nalmost completely gone.  The seats seem to be composed almost entirely of\nsilver duct tape.  The biggest cup of coffee you've ever seen sits atop the\nwobbly table.

The only donuts that\nseem even remotely fresh are the jelly-filled ones.  Perhaps someone\noccasionally buys and, if they are really brave, actually eats one.\n~\nE\nsquirrel~\nYep.. it is definately a squirrel.  However, upos closer inspection, you \nrealize it is not dead.  Its fur is singed in a few places from having \ncigarettes butted out on it, but, otherewize, it is in remarkably good\nshape.  The real question, though, is how it got there, and what reason\ncould it possibly have for taking up resisdence in an ashtray?\n~\nE\nstool patron booth~\nAll the booths and stools are covered with torn red vinyl.  Some of the \nlarger tears are repaired with sticky, silver duct tape.  The patrons\nseated on the stools are almost impossible to tell apart.  Each is clothed\nin faded blue jeans, a T-shirt, and a ratty old leather jacket.

Except for the constant lapping of the waves, and the\noccasional night creature, all is silent.  Several piles of boat house\nnecessaties are strewn about, as well as a single white carpet in the \nmiddle of the room.  You find this place incredibly soothing, and are quite\nrelaxed as you sit down on the sleeping bag that is perfectly placed in \norder to get the best, night sky view.\n~\n0 ACDJT 0\nO rage khira bloodmoon~\nD1\nExit ~\nportal~\n16451 0 10089\nD3\nExit ~\nportal~\n16451 0 10091\nE\nnight sky stars~\nFrom beyond the glass of the boat house windows, the blackness of the night\nis filled with thousands of tiny stars.  The milky way weaves its fuzzy \ntrail in a wavy fashion across the top of the sky.\nIt is very dark, as no moon can be seen.\n~\nE\nwindows~\nIn the distance behind the boat house, one can see a small, well lit\ncottage; the sounds of laughter, and card playing echo from within.  The\nbeautiful night sky, covered in a blanket of endless stars stretches out\nbeyond the glass.  Only footsteps away, one can see the darkened waters of\nthe river, as the lights from near by cottages glitter and sparkle in the\nwaves.\n~\nS\n#10091\nBloodMoon and Mythorn's Hall of Souls~\nIn this room, BloodMoon and Mythorn share their deepest secrets,\nre-affirming their true friendship for each other.\n~\n0 ACDNPT 0\nO bloodmoon mythorn~\nD1\nExit ~\nportal~\n16451 0 10090\nD3\nExit ~\nportal~\n16451 0 10038\nS\n#10092\nThe Temporal Vortex~\nTumbling through the mists of time, you find yourself at the center\nof Creation.

The walls and matching\ncurtains are done in earth tones of reds and beiges.  A single, picture\nwindow reveils the breath-taking rocky rapids of the lower Ottawa river.\nYou see a single desk tucked neatly against one wall with a matching, small\nand unobtrusive book shelf beside it.

The night sky, beautiful in it's brilliant blackness, is\nlittered with the uncountable stars and constellations above.  Fish swim in\nan antiquated fountain. The walls are covered with fine art, and the floor\ncovered with a finely woven rug, it's intricacies unimaginable.  The room\nis also full of plants.  Vines and palms of all types crowd the corners of\nthe room, growing over one another.  On one of the walls, however, there is\nno flora.  Instead, a great library, it's books arranged and covering every\ninch of the shelves.  There are tremendously old books, older than the art\nand plant life covering the other walls.  Greek, Latin, English, writings\nof every language known to man and even some that are no longer known cover\nthe shelf.  The room is nothing short of incredible.\n~\n0 CDT 0\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nO 0 10005 100 10018\t* a hole in the wall\nP 1 10008  -1 10005  1\t*   a golden heart-shaped locket\nM 0 10009   1 10077  1\t*

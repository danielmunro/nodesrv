The armor and dress of\nthe soldiers is highly unusual. Unlike the common warriors of the\nrest of Boinga, these men wear armor that seems almost ridiculously\nlight, as if it would scarcely protect them from a single blow.\nJudging from the behavior of the soldiers, it's obvious they have\ncomplete faith in their abilities, however. Near the soldiers\nstands a sorry-looking man, evidently a spellcaster of some sort.\n  Looking at the wall, it is high, very solid-looking, and\npractically impenetrable, you decide.

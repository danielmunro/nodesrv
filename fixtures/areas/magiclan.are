The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n \nThe Southern gates of the ancient city of Ofcol had now fallen below the\nhorizon.  A place to rest her weary feet was all that Zelaca could think about.\nIt was only a day ago that Naczar, Usurper of Ofcol, had banished Zelaca and\nher three score of brethren, The {YZealots{x, out of Ofcol.  Now, the wanderers\nwere without any place to wander to: already having been exiled from every\nknown settlement in Boinga, just for claiming to have had visions of more\npowerful an entity than the ruling kings had ever seen with their own eyes:\nThe {WAlmighty{x.\n \nBut, The {WAlmighty{x would not let his chosen be without shelter, for only they\nwere gifted with the knowledge of the celestial secrets binding the heavens and\nthe earth.  They were not ready to die off after all they had labored for.  Up\nto this point, the Order of {YZealot{x has never ceased to exist, not for a moment.\nAnd after Zelaca we find an uninterupted sequence of prophets of the Order down\nto our own time, and if the name and seat of the true ruling prophet who guides\nits sublime labors remain a mystery today, an impenetrable secret known only to\nthe true believers, it is because the hour of the Order has not struck and the\ntime is not ripe.\n \ncontinued.......type look 1  (one...not an \"l\")\n \n~\nE\n1~\nWith the help of the elven monks from the Valley to the northeast, a great\nstone altar of sacrifice was born at the base of Mount Olympus.  Arrayed in\nwhite linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of\nthe altar making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the {WAlmighty{x:\nand when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and\ninstruments of music, and praised the {WAlmighty{x, singing:\n \n.     For He is good.\n.     For His mercy endureth forever.\n.     Rise Ye {WAlmighty{x, come hither to thine altar.\n.     Ye and thy ark of power.\n.     Thy priests, {WAlmighty{x God, are vested in salvation,\n.     Thy faithful rejoice in prosperity.\n \nAnd their songs were heard.  A grand pillar of {rfire{x descended from atop the\ngreat mountain to heed their prayers, and The {WAlmighty{x spoketh:\n \n.     Rest thy weary feet, Believers,\n.     For here you will rest,\n.     And worship thy lord for eternity.\n.     Guided by my eternal {WLight{x,\n.     Thy children, and their children\n.     Who follow will be granted purity\n.

It is on this site\n.     Of this holy of the holiest,\n.     At this altar you have built before me,\n.     That I command you to erect a tower of worship,\n.     A bridge to the heavens.\n.     Made of {yacacia wood{x,\n.     Plated, inside and out, with pure {Ygold{x:\n.     One hundred cubits wide, by\n.     Ten thousand cubits high\n.     And fifty cubits in diameter.\n \nAnd with the word of The {WAlmighty{x, it was done.  A {ygolden{x archway to the\nheavens, built with the architectural splendor and grandeur that the secrets of\nthe Order contain.  For this tower tells the story and struggles of a people\nwho are truly enlightened, and true believers.  It is the {WLight{x and {RHand{x of The\n{WAlmighty{x that has given his children a home.  A home which used to be a place\nof exile.\n \n(continued)....type look 2 \n \n~\nE\n2~\nIt is the {WLight{x, for the tower shone with a radiance not of this world. Men and\nbeasts alike were drawn to its holy splendor by a force unknown to them. But\nThe {WAlmighty{x knew what power lay in that tower, and the heavenly light from\nit filled the Believers with hope, courage, and devotion.\n \nAnd it is the {RHand{x, for housed inside the pillar of heaven were the noble\nwarriors, crusaders devoted to His cause, and courageous through His blessing.\nAnd the {RHand{x, with His unspoken word, descended mightily upon those who defied\nHim and defended His honor and glory with each and every finger.\n \n \n~\nE\nexpansion~\n.                         Growth and Expansion\n \nThe tower was constructed close to Ofcol, a monument of defiance that bore no\nless strength than Captain Jacklyn, whose liberating army marched on Ofcol and\noverthew Nazcar but one calendar year later. And on that day there was much\ncelebration banquets, festivals, music, and gaity reigned. In the halls of the\n{YZealots{x much praying took place, and devotees thanked The {WAlmighty{x for granting\nthe power to vanquish the evil usurper.\n \n.     O heavenly lord!\n.     Upon this great day we thank thee\n.     For Ye hath given us strength\n.     And Ye hath given us courage\n.     And Ye hath shown us the way to truth\n.     Through thineself.\n \n(continued) .....type look 3\n \n~\nE\n3~\nAnd hearing these prayers, He answered through a young disciple, Soreca, who\nhad seemed to Him especially devoted:\n \n.     Tis true, my children,\n.     My chosen ones,\n.     That I will forever watch over you\n.     As I have this time.\n.     But go now,\n.     And show others my {WLight{x,\n.     And build upon our already strong family,\n.     So that our future victories will be\n.     Even more numerous and glorious\n.     Than they are now.\n \nThus He spake unto His children through His chosen priest, Soreca. And thus\nSoreca was chosen to go forth from that radiant tower to the farthest reaches\nof Boinga, enlightening others to His cause.\n \nAnd with time, their numbers grew strong. Soreca returned to the tower within\ntwo years, with a following of worshippers for His cause. Together they all\nlived and grew together, and bound themselves tightly to each other and to Him.\nTheir family lived and prospered in peace, until one day, when the Great Evil\nentered their home.\n \n~\nE\ndark~\n.                         The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n \nIndeed, the {DPlague{x had been there for some time, lying latent, rising in power\nslowly but surely. Insidously, he beguiled the leaders into giving higher rank\nthan he deserved. At first, to the loyal worshippers, he seemed harmless\nenough, he fought well in battle, and spoke kindly to his brothers.\n \nBut he lusted for power, he desired to change of the trusted ways of the\n{YZealots{x. The interrogations began: debates lasting hours on end, so bitter that\neven the bravest of warriors closed their ears and hoped for end. The\nquestioners were few, but strong. They relentlessly persisted, prying into the\nevil's {Mmind{x, {Rheart{x, and {Wsoul{x.\n \nAnd in this period, which is called the {DDark Age{x of {YZealot{x, there was so much\ndiscord sown within the clan that the very heavens, disturbed by the great\nturmoil struck down all the leaders. But The {WAlmighty{x calmed the {YZealots{x'\nfears, and filled them with hope again:\n \n(continued) ...type look 4\n \n~\nE\n4~\n.     My children,\n.     See now this living falsehood.\n.     Let it not reside inside your walls.\n.     I have seen the strength in you,\n.     To purify and believe\n.     Now purify this evil,\n.     Rid thyself of this sinister being.\n \nAnd so interrogations continued, and finally they purged the Great Evil,\nbranding him an infidel.\n \n.     Thank ye, O {WAlmighty{x\n.     Thou hast given us strength once more\n.     To fight off the {DPlague{x\n.     And show us the way\n.     To {WLight{x, once more.\n \nThus they purged the {DPlague{x which had seeped into their veins and tried to\ncorrupt their hearts. The {WAlmighty{x administered the medicine of truth and\n{WLight{x, and the disease shriveled and withered under its strength.\n \n~\nE\ngolden~\n.                      The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \nWith the fall of the Great Evil, a new leader was born. He was fair and just,\nand introduced changes with the greatest clarity. It was he who divided the\nBelievers into the {WLight{x, the {RHand{x, and the {DInquisitors{x. All forms of rank and\nstatus were done away with, and all lived in peace and equality, troubled not\nby the competition for higher rank.\n \nAnd now, in the {YGolden Age{x: we are prosperous, and our enemies trouble us\nnot. Our warriors are strong and valiant in battle, our priests carry forth His\nword to the farthest reaches of the land. Our tower is constantly expanding\nand stretching farther into the heavens. It is our stronghold, our temple, and\nour gateway into other worlds. From the top of it shines a bright {WLight{x, a\nbeacon to all the lands surrounding it, attracting Believers and followers from\nall around. We are thriving under His protection and guidance. We are His\nfuture and bear it into the future with great vigor and loyalty.\n \n.     May He watch you\n.     And save you\n.     And guide you\n.     And you will surely prosper.\n \n~\nE\ntable~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\ncontent~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\nlost~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nbible~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nZealot~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nholy~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nscripture~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\n#31811\nplaque zealot month~\nA plaque of ivory and gold hangs here.~\nA plaque of gold and ivory hangs here.~\nplaque~\nfurniture 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nE\nplaque zealot month~\nApril, 2000:  \nKing Poet, for his heart of GOLD.\nMay, 2000: \n[30  Elf  Sam] [Zealot/4] Halo Head Inquisitor of the Almighty for his \n                          dedication to the Zealot cause.\nJune, 2000: \n[26  Yinn  Ass] [Zealot /2] Apathy.................\n                            His undying loyalty to the Almighty is a beacon \n                            for us all to follow. \n~\n#31812\nfountain water~\na fountain~\nA small drinking fountain is here.~\nivory~\nfountain 0 0\n0 0 'milk' 0 0\n0 0 0 G\n#31813\nempty can of whup-ass~\nan empty can of whup-ass~\nAn empty can, marked with the label \"Whup-Ass\", lays on the ground before you, reminding you of your recent defeat.~\nwhup-ass~\ntrash BNT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 10 100 P\n#31814\nnt new thalos~\na swirling black mist~\n~\n~\nportal R P\n0 0 0 9506 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31815\nblood pool~\na pool of blood~\nA sanctified pool of blood is here.~\nblood~\nfountain AOY 0\n0 0 'blood' 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31816\npew empty space third row~\nan empty space in the third row~\nA row of intricately carved wooden pews are here.~\nwood~\nfurniture OY 0\n5 0 CFIL 100 100\n0 10000 0 P\n#31817\nholy forge~\nThe Holy Forge~\nYou stare in awe at the magnificent, Holy Forge.~\nmetal~\ntrash Y 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31818\ncot~\na swirling black mist~\n~\nmist~\nportal RTY P\n0 0 0 6023 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31819\nthrone gold~\na Throne of Gold~\nA Throne of Gold resides here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31820\nthrone black diamonds~\na Throne of Black Diamonds~\nA Throne of Black Diamonds collects energy here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31821\nThrone Silk Jewels~\na Throne of Silk and Jewels~\nA Throne of Silk and Jewels exists here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31822\nPit of useful stuff~\nA Pit of useful stuff~\nA pit of useful stuff for clanmates is here.~\nMarble~\ncontainer Y 0\n10000 0 0 1000 100\n0 0 0 P\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#31800\nEntrance to the Almighty's Church~\nThose having gained the favor of The Almighty are permitted\nentrance into His grand Church.

The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n \nThe Southern gates of the ancient city of Ofcol had now fallen below the\nhorizon.  A place to rest her weary feet was all that Zelaca could think about.\nIt was only a day ago that Naczar, Usurper of Ofcol, had banished Zelaca and\nher three score of brethren, The {YZealots{x, out of Ofcol.  Now, the wanderers\nwere without any place to wander to: already having been exiled from every\nknown settlement in Boinga, just for claiming to have had visions of more\npowerful an entity than the ruling kings had ever seen with their own eyes:\nThe {WAlmighty{x.\n \nBut, The {WAlmighty{x would not let his chosen be without shelter, for only they\nwere gifted with the knowledge of the celestial secrets binding the heavens and\nthe earth.  They were not ready to die off after all they had labored for.  Up\nto this point, the Order of {YZealot{x has never ceased to exist, not for a moment.\nAnd after Zelaca we find an uninterupted sequence of prophets of the Order down\nto our own time, and if the name and seat of the true ruling prophet who guides\nits sublime labors remain a mystery today, an impenetrable secret known only to\nthe true believers, it is because the hour of the Order has not struck and the\ntime is not ripe.\n \ncontinued.......type look 1  (one...not an \"l\")\n \n~\nE\n1~\nWith the help of the elven monks from the Valley to the northeast, a great\nstone altar of sacrifice was born at the base of Mount Olympus.  Arrayed in\nwhite linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of\nthe altar making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the {WAlmighty{x:\nand when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and\ninstruments of music, and praised the {WAlmighty{x, singing:\n \n.     For He is good.\n.     For His mercy endureth forever.\n.     Rise Ye {WAlmighty{x, come hither to thine altar.\n.     Ye and thy ark of power.\n.     Thy priests, {WAlmighty{x God, are vested in salvation,\n.     Thy faithful rejoice in prosperity.\n \nAnd their songs were heard.  A grand pillar of {rfire{x descended from atop the\ngreat mountain to heed their prayers, and The {WAlmighty{x spoketh:\n \n.     Rest thy weary feet, Believers,\n.     For here you will rest,\n.

A {ygolden{x archway to the\nheavens, built with the architectural splendor and grandeur that the secrets of\nthe Order contain.  For this tower tells the story and struggles of a people\nwho are truly enlightened, and true believers.  It is the {WLight{x and {RHand{x of The\n{WAlmighty{x that has given his children a home.  A home which used to be a place\nof exile.\n \n(continued)....type look 2 \n \n~\nE\n2~\nIt is the {WLight{x, for the tower shone with a radiance not of this world. Men and\nbeasts alike were drawn to its holy splendor by a force unknown to them. But\nThe {WAlmighty{x knew what power lay in that tower, and the heavenly light from\nit filled the Believers with hope, courage, and devotion.\n \nAnd it is the {RHand{x, for housed inside the pillar of heaven were the noble\nwarriors, crusaders devoted to His cause, and courageous through His blessing.\nAnd the {RHand{x, with His unspoken word, descended mightily upon those who defied\nHim and defended His honor and glory with each and every finger.\n \n \n~\nE\nexpansion~\n.                         Growth and Expansion\n \nThe tower was constructed close to Ofcol, a monument of defiance that bore no\nless strength than Captain Jacklyn, whose liberating army marched on Ofcol and\noverthew Nazcar but one calendar year later. And on that day there was much\ncelebration banquets, festivals, music, and gaity reigned. In the halls of the\n{YZealots{x much praying took place, and devotees thanked The {WAlmighty{x for granting\nthe power to vanquish the evil usurper.\n \n.     O heavenly lord!\n.     Upon this great day we thank thee\n.     For Ye hath given us strength\n.     And Ye hath given us courage\n.     And Ye hath shown us the way to truth\n.     Through thineself.\n \n(continued) .....type look 3\n \n~\nE\n3~\nAnd hearing these prayers, He answered through a young disciple, Soreca, who\nhad seemed to Him especially devoted:\n \n.     Tis true, my children,\n.     My chosen ones,\n.     That I will forever watch over you\n.     As I have this time.\n.     But go now,\n.     And show others my {WLight{x,\n.     And build upon our already strong family,\n.     So that our future victories will be\n.     Even more numerous and glorious\n.     Than they are now.\n \nThus He spake unto His children through His chosen priest, Soreca. And thus\nSoreca was chosen to go forth from that radiant tower to the farthest reaches\nof Boinga, enlightening others to His cause.\n \nAnd with time, their numbers grew strong. Soreca returned to the tower within\ntwo years, with a following of worshippers for His cause. Together they all\nlived and grew together, and bound themselves tightly to each other and to Him.\nTheir family lived and prospered in peace, until one day, when the Great Evil\nentered their home.\n \n~\nE\ndark~\n.                         The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n \nIndeed, the {DPlague{x had been there for some time, lying latent, rising in power\nslowly but surely. Insidously, he beguiled the leaders into giving higher rank\nthan he deserved. At first, to the loyal worshippers, he seemed harmless\nenough, he fought well in battle, and spoke kindly to his brothers.\n \nBut he lusted for power, he desired to change of the trusted ways of the\n{YZealots{x. The interrogations began: debates lasting hours on end, so bitter that\neven the bravest of warriors closed their ears and hoped for end. The\nquestioners were few, but strong. They relentlessly persisted, prying into the\nevil's {Mmind{x, {Rheart{x, and {Wsoul{x.\n \nAnd in this period, which is called the {DDark Age{x of {YZealot{x, there was so much\ndiscord sown within the clan that the very heavens, disturbed by the great\nturmoil struck down all the leaders. But The {WAlmighty{x calmed the {YZealots{x'\nfears, and filled them with hope again:\n \n(continued) ...type look 4\n \n~\nE\n4~\n.     My children,\n.     See now this living falsehood.\n.     Let it not reside inside your walls.\n.     I have seen the strength in you,\n.     To purify and believe\n.     Now purify this evil,\n.     Rid thyself of this sinister being.\n \nAnd so interrogations continued, and finally they purged the Great Evil,\nbranding him an infidel.\n \n.     Thank ye, O {WAlmighty{x\n.     Thou hast given us strength once more\n.     To fight off the {DPlague{x\n.     And show us the way\n.     To {WLight{x, once more.\n \nThus they purged the {DPlague{x which had seeped into their veins and tried to\ncorrupt their hearts. The {WAlmighty{x administered the medicine of truth and\n{WLight{x, and the disease shriveled and withered under its strength.\n \n~\nE\ngolden~\n.                      The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \nWith the fall of the Great Evil, a new leader was born. He was fair and just,\nand introduced changes with the greatest clarity. It was he who divided the\nBelievers into the {WLight{x, the {RHand{x, and the {DInquisitors{x. All forms of rank and\nstatus were done away with, and all lived in peace and equality, troubled not\nby the competition for higher rank.\n \nAnd now, in the {YGolden Age{x: we are prosperous, and our enemies trouble us\nnot. Our warriors are strong and valiant in battle, our priests carry forth His\nword to the farthest reaches of the land. Our tower is constantly expanding\nand stretching farther into the heavens. It is our stronghold, our temple, and\nour gateway into other worlds. From the top of it shines a bright {WLight{x, a\nbeacon to all the lands surrounding it, attracting Believers and followers from\nall around. We are thriving under His protection and guidance. We are His\nfuture and bear it into the future with great vigor and loyalty.\n \n.     May He watch you\n.     And save you\n.     And guide you\n.     And you will surely prosper.\n \n~\nE\ntable~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\ncontent~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\nlost~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nbible~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nZealot~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nholy~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nscripture~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\n#31811\nplaque zealot month~\nA plaque of ivory and gold hangs here.~\nA plaque of gold and ivory hangs here.~\nplaque~\nfurniture 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nE\nplaque zealot month~\nApril, 2000:  \nKing Poet, for his heart of GOLD.\nMay, 2000: \n[30  Elf  Sam] [Zealot/4] Halo Head Inquisitor of the Almighty for his \n                          dedication to the Zealot cause.\nJune, 2000: \n[26  Yinn  Ass] [Zealot /2] Apathy.................\n                            His undying loyalty to the Almighty is a beacon \n                            for us all to follow. \n~\n#31812\nfountain water~\na fountain~\nA small drinking fountain is here.~\nivory~\nfountain 0 0\n0 0 'milk' 0 0\n0 0 0 G\n#31813\nempty can of whup-ass~\nan empty can of whup-ass~\nAn empty can, marked with the label \"Whup-Ass\", lays on the ground before you, reminding you of your recent defeat.~\nwhup-ass~\ntrash BNT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 10 100 P\n#31814\nnt new thalos~\na swirling black mist~\n~\n~\nportal R P\n0 0 0 9506 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31815\nblood pool~\na pool of blood~\nA sanctified pool of blood is here.~\nblood~\nfountain AOY 0\n0 0 'blood' 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31816\npew empty space third row~\nan empty space in the third row~\nA row of intricately carved wooden pews are here.~\nwood~\nfurniture OY 0\n5 0 CFIL 100 100\n0 10000 0 P\n#31817\nholy forge~\nThe Holy Forge~\nYou stare in awe at the magnificent, Holy Forge.~\nmetal~\ntrash Y 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31818\ncot~\na swirling black mist~\n~\nmist~\nportal RTY P\n0 0 0 6023 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31819\nthrone gold~\na Throne of Gold~\nA Throne of Gold resides here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31820\nthrone black diamonds~\na Throne of Black Diamonds~\nA Throne of Black Diamonds collects energy here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31821\nThrone Silk Jewels~\na Throne of Silk and Jewels~\nA Throne of Silk and Jewels exists here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31822\nPit of useful stuff~\nA Pit of useful stuff~\nA pit of useful stuff for clanmates is here.~\nMarble~\ncontainer Y 0\n10000 0 0 1000 100\n0 0 0 P\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#31800\nEntrance to the Almighty's Church~\nThose having gained the favor of The Almighty are permitted\nentrance into His grand Church.

The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n \nThe Southern gates of the ancient city of Ofcol had now fallen below the\nhorizon.  A place to rest her weary feet was all that Zelaca could think about.\nIt was only a day ago that Naczar, Usurper of Ofcol, had banished Zelaca and\nher three score of brethren, The {YZealots{x, out of Ofcol.  Now, the wanderers\nwere without any place to wander to: already having been exiled from every\nknown settlement in Boinga, just for claiming to have had visions of more\npowerful an entity than the ruling kings had ever seen with their own eyes:\nThe {WAlmighty{x.\n \nBut, The {WAlmighty{x would not let his chosen be without shelter, for only they\nwere gifted with the knowledge of the celestial secrets binding the heavens and\nthe earth.  They were not ready to die off after all they had labored for.  Up\nto this point, the Order of {YZealot{x has never ceased to exist, not for a moment.\nAnd after Zelaca we find an uninterupted sequence of prophets of the Order down\nto our own time, and if the name and seat of the true ruling prophet who guides\nits sublime labors remain a mystery today, an impenetrable secret known only to\nthe true believers, it is because the hour of the Order has not struck and the\ntime is not ripe.\n \ncontinued.......type look 1  (one...not an \"l\")\n \n~\nE\n1~\nWith the help of the elven monks from the Valley to the northeast, a great\nstone altar of sacrifice was born at the base of Mount Olympus.  Arrayed in\nwhite linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of\nthe altar making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the {WAlmighty{x:\nand when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and\ninstruments of music, and praised the {WAlmighty{x, singing:\n \n.     For He is good.\n.     For His mercy endureth forever.\n.     Rise Ye {WAlmighty{x, come hither to thine altar.\n.     Ye and thy ark of power.\n.     Thy priests, {WAlmighty{x God, are vested in salvation,\n.     Thy faithful rejoice in prosperity.\n \nAnd their songs were heard.  A grand pillar of {rfire{x descended from atop the\ngreat mountain to heed their prayers, and The {WAlmighty{x spoketh:\n \n.     Rest thy weary feet, Believers,\n.     For here you will rest,\n.     And worship thy lord for eternity.\n.     Guided by my eternal {WLight{x,\n.     Thy children, and their children\n.     Who follow will be granted purity\n.     To hear my voice, for I am thy lord,\n.     The {WAlmighty{x, and they are my\n.     Children as well, the chosen.\n \n~\nE\ntower~\n.                          The Building of the Tower\n \n.     It is on this site\n.     Of this holy of the holiest,\n.     At this altar you have built before me,\n.     That I command you to erect a tower of worship,\n.     A bridge to the heavens.\n.     Made of {yacacia wood{x,\n.     Plated, inside and out, with pure {Ygold{x:\n.     One hundred cubits wide, by\n.     Ten thousand cubits high\n.     And fifty cubits in diameter.\n \nAnd with the word of The {WAlmighty{x, it was done.  A {ygolden{x archway to the\nheavens, built with the architectural splendor and grandeur that the secrets of\nthe Order contain.  For this tower tells the story and struggles of a people\nwho are truly enlightened, and true believers.  It is the {WLight{x and {RHand{x of The\n{WAlmighty{x that has given his children a home.  A home which used to be a place\nof exile.\n \n(continued)....type look 2 \n \n~\nE\n2~\nIt is the {WLight{x, for the tower shone with a radiance not of this world. Men and\nbeasts alike were drawn to its holy splendor by a force unknown to them. But\nThe {WAlmighty{x knew what power lay in that tower, and the heavenly light from\nit filled the Believers with hope, courage, and devotion.\n \nAnd it is the {RHand{x, for housed inside the pillar of heaven were the noble\nwarriors, crusaders devoted to His cause, and courageous through His blessing.\nAnd the {RHand{x, with His unspoken word, descended mightily upon those who defied\nHim and defended His honor and glory with each and every finger.\n \n \n~\nE\nexpansion~\n.                         Growth and Expansion\n \nThe tower was constructed close to Ofcol, a monument of defiance that bore no\nless strength than Captain Jacklyn, whose liberating army marched on Ofcol and\noverthew Nazcar but one calendar year later. And on that day there was much\ncelebration banquets, festivals, music, and gaity reigned. In the halls of the\n{YZealots{x much praying took place, and devotees thanked The {WAlmighty{x for granting\nthe power to vanquish the evil usurper.\n \n.     O heavenly lord!\n.     Upon this great day we thank thee\n.     For Ye hath given us strength\n.     And Ye hath given us courage\n.     And Ye hath shown us the way to truth\n.     Through thineself.\n \n(continued) .....type look 3\n \n~\nE\n3~\nAnd hearing these prayers, He answered through a young disciple, Soreca, who\nhad seemed to Him especially devoted:\n \n.     Tis true, my children,\n.     My chosen ones,\n.     That I will forever watch over you\n.     As I have this time.\n.     But go now,\n.     And show others my {WLight{x,\n.     And build upon our already strong family,\n.     So that our future victories will be\n.     Even more numerous and glorious\n.     Than they are now.\n \nThus He spake unto His children through His chosen priest, Soreca. And thus\nSoreca was chosen to go forth from that radiant tower to the farthest reaches\nof Boinga, enlightening others to His cause.\n \nAnd with time, their numbers grew strong. Soreca returned to the tower within\ntwo years, with a following of worshippers for His cause. Together they all\nlived and grew together, and bound themselves tightly to each other and to Him.\nTheir family lived and prospered in peace, until one day, when the Great Evil\nentered their home.\n \n~\nE\ndark~\n.                         The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n \nIndeed, the {DPlague{x had been there for some time, lying latent, rising in power\nslowly but surely. Insidously, he beguiled the leaders into giving higher rank\nthan he deserved. At first, to the loyal worshippers, he seemed harmless\nenough, he fought well in battle, and spoke kindly to his brothers.\n \nBut he lusted for power, he desired to change of the trusted ways of the\n{YZealots{x. The interrogations began: debates lasting hours on end, so bitter that\neven the bravest of warriors closed their ears and hoped for end. The\nquestioners were few, but strong. They relentlessly persisted, prying into the\nevil's {Mmind{x, {Rheart{x, and {Wsoul{x.\n \nAnd in this period, which is called the {DDark Age{x of {YZealot{x, there was so much\ndiscord sown within the clan that the very heavens, disturbed by the great\nturmoil struck down all the leaders. But The {WAlmighty{x calmed the {YZealots{x'\nfears, and filled them with hope again:\n \n(continued) ...type look 4\n \n~\nE\n4~\n.     My children,\n.     See now this living falsehood.\n.     Let it not reside inside your walls.\n.     I have seen the strength in you,\n.     To purify and believe\n.     Now purify this evil,\n.

They were not ready to die off after all they had labored for.  Up\nto this point, the Order of {YZealot{x has never ceased to exist, not for a moment.\nAnd after Zelaca we find an uninterupted sequence of prophets of the Order down\nto our own time, and if the name and seat of the true ruling prophet who guides\nits sublime labors remain a mystery today, an impenetrable secret known only to\nthe true believers, it is because the hour of the Order has not struck and the\ntime is not ripe.\n \ncontinued.......type look 1  (one...not an \"l\")","With the help of the elven monks from the Valley to the northeast, a great\nstone altar of sacrifice was born at the base of Mount Olympus.  Arrayed in\nwhite linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of\nthe altar making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the {WAlmighty{x:\nand when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and\ninstruments of music, and praised the {WAlmighty{x, singing:\n \n.

And fifty cubits in diameter.\n \nAnd with the word of The {WAlmighty{x, it was done.  A {ygolden{x archway to the\nheavens, built with the architectural splendor and grandeur that the secrets of\nthe Order contain.  For this tower tells the story and struggles of a people\nwho are truly enlightened, and true believers.  It is the {WLight{x and {RHand{x of The\n{WAlmighty{x that has given his children a home.  A home which used to be a place\nof exile.\n \n(continued)....type look 2","It is the {WLight{x, for the tower shone with a radiance not of this world.

But\nThe {WAlmighty{x knew what power lay in that tower, and the heavenly light from\nit filled the Believers with hope, courage, and devotion.\n \nAnd it is the {RHand{x, for housed inside the pillar of heaven were the noble\nwarriors, crusaders devoted to His cause, and courageous through His blessing.\nAnd the {RHand{x, with His unspoken word, descended mightily upon those who defied\nHim and defended His honor and glory with each and every finger.",".                         Growth and Expansion\n \nThe tower was constructed close to Ofcol, a monument of defiance that bore no\nless strength than Captain Jacklyn, whose liberating army marched on Ofcol and\noverthew Nazcar but one calendar year later. And on that day there was much\ncelebration banquets, festivals, music, and gaity reigned. In the halls of the\n{YZealots{x much praying took place, and devotees thanked The {WAlmighty{x for granting\nthe power to vanquish the evil usurper.\n \n.     O heavenly lord!\n.

Than they are now.\n \nThus He spake unto His children through His chosen priest, Soreca. And thus\nSoreca was chosen to go forth from that radiant tower to the farthest reaches\nof Boinga, enlightening others to His cause.\n \nAnd with time, their numbers grew strong. Soreca returned to the tower within\ntwo years, with a following of worshippers for His cause. Together they all\nlived and grew together, and bound themselves tightly to each other and to Him.\nTheir family lived and prospered in peace, until one day, when the Great Evil\nentered their home.",".                         The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n \nIndeed, the {DPlague{x had been there for some time, lying latent, rising in power\nslowly but surely. Insidously, he beguiled the leaders into giving higher rank\nthan he deserved. At first, to the loyal worshippers, he seemed harmless\nenough, he fought well in battle, and spoke kindly to his brothers.\n \nBut he lusted for power, he desired to change of the trusted ways of the\n{YZealots{x. The interrogations began: debates lasting hours on end, so bitter that\neven the bravest of warriors closed their ears and hoped for end. The\nquestioners were few, but strong. They relentlessly persisted, prying into the\nevil's {Mmind{x, {Rheart{x, and {Wsoul{x.\n \nAnd in this period, which is called the {DDark Age{x of {YZealot{x, there was so much\ndiscord sown within the clan that the very heavens, disturbed by the great\nturmoil struck down all the leaders. But The {WAlmighty{x calmed the {YZealots{x'\nfears, and filled them with hope again:\n \n(continued) ...type look 4",".     My children,\n.     See now this living falsehood.\n.     Let it not reside inside your walls.\n.     I have seen the strength in you,\n.     To purify and believe\n.     Now purify this evil,\n.     Rid thyself of this sinister being.\n \nAnd so interrogations continued, and finally they purged the Great Evil,\nbranding him an infidel.\n \n.     Thank ye, O {WAlmighty{x\n.     Thou hast given us strength once more\n.     To fight off the {DPlague{x\n.     And show us the way\n.     To {WLight{x, once more.\n \nThus they purged the {DPlague{x which had seeped into their veins and tried to\ncorrupt their hearts. The {WAlmighty{x administered the medicine of truth and\n{WLight{x, and the disease shriveled and withered under its strength.",".                      The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \nWith the fall of the Great Evil, a new leader was born. He was fair and just,\nand introduced changes with the greatest clarity. It was he who divided the\nBelievers into the {WLight{x, the {RHand{x, and the {DInquisitors{x. All forms of rank and\nstatus were done away with, and all lived in peace and equality, troubled not\nby the competition for higher rank.\n \nAnd now, in the {YGolden Age{x: we are prosperous, and our enemies trouble us\nnot. Our warriors are strong and valiant in battle, our priests carry forth His\nword to the farthest reaches of the land. Our tower is constantly expanding\nand stretching farther into the heavens. It is our stronghold, our temple, and\nour gateway into other worlds. From the top of it shines a bright {WLight{x, a\nbeacon to all the lands surrounding it, attracting Believers and followers from\nall around. We are thriving under His protection and guidance. We are His\nfuture and bear it into the future with great vigor and loyalty.\n \n.     May He watch you\n.     And save you\n.     And guide you\n.

Up\nto this point, the Order of {YZealot{x has never ceased to exist, not for a moment.\nAnd after Zelaca we find an uninterupted sequence of prophets of the Order down\nto our own time, and if the name and seat of the true ruling prophet who guides\nits sublime labors remain a mystery today, an impenetrable secret known only to\nthe true believers, it is because the hour of the Order has not struck and the\ntime is not ripe.\n \ncontinued.......type look 1  (one...not an \"l\")\n \n~\nE\n1~\nWith the help of the elven monks from the Valley to the northeast, a great\nstone altar of sacrifice was born at the base of Mount Olympus.  Arrayed in\nwhite linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of\nthe altar making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the {WAlmighty{x:\nand when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and\ninstruments of music, and praised the {WAlmighty{x, singing:\n \n.     For He is good.\n.     For His mercy endureth forever.\n.     Rise Ye {WAlmighty{x, come hither to thine altar.\n.     Ye and thy ark of power.\n.     Thy priests, {WAlmighty{x God, are vested in salvation,\n.     Thy faithful rejoice in prosperity.\n \nAnd their songs were heard.  A grand pillar of {rfire{x descended from atop the\ngreat mountain to heed their prayers, and The {WAlmighty{x spoketh:\n \n.     Rest thy weary feet, Believers,\n.     For here you will rest,\n.     And worship thy lord for eternity.\n.     Guided by my eternal {WLight{x,\n.     Thy children, and their children\n.     Who follow will be granted purity\n.

It is on this site\n.     Of this holy of the holiest,\n.     At this altar you have built before me,\n.     That I command you to erect a tower of worship,\n.     A bridge to the heavens.\n.     Made of {yacacia wood{x,\n.     Plated, inside and out, with pure {Ygold{x:\n.     One hundred cubits wide, by\n.     Ten thousand cubits high\n.     And fifty cubits in diameter.\n \nAnd with the word of The {WAlmighty{x, it was done.  A {ygolden{x archway to the\nheavens, built with the architectural splendor and grandeur that the secrets of\nthe Order contain.  For this tower tells the story and struggles of a people\nwho are truly enlightened, and true believers.  It is the {WLight{x and {RHand{x of The\n{WAlmighty{x that has given his children a home.  A home which used to be a place\nof exile.\n \n(continued)....type look 2 \n \n~\nE\n2~\nIt is the {WLight{x, for the tower shone with a radiance not of this world. Men and\nbeasts alike were drawn to its holy splendor by a force unknown to them. But\nThe {WAlmighty{x knew what power lay in that tower, and the heavenly light from\nit filled the Believers with hope, courage, and devotion.\n \nAnd it is the {RHand{x, for housed inside the pillar of heaven were the noble\nwarriors, crusaders devoted to His cause, and courageous through His blessing.\nAnd the {RHand{x, with His unspoken word, descended mightily upon those who defied\nHim and defended His honor and glory with each and every finger.\n \n \n~\nE\nexpansion~\n.                         Growth and Expansion\n \nThe tower was constructed close to Ofcol, a monument of defiance that bore no\nless strength than Captain Jacklyn, whose liberating army marched on Ofcol and\noverthew Nazcar but one calendar year later. And on that day there was much\ncelebration banquets, festivals, music, and gaity reigned. In the halls of the\n{YZealots{x much praying took place, and devotees thanked The {WAlmighty{x for granting\nthe power to vanquish the evil usurper.\n \n.     O heavenly lord!\n.     Upon this great day we thank thee\n.     For Ye hath given us strength\n.     And Ye hath given us courage\n.     And Ye hath shown us the way to truth\n.     Through thineself.\n \n(continued) .....type look 3\n \n~\nE\n3~\nAnd hearing these prayers, He answered through a young disciple, Soreca, who\nhad seemed to Him especially devoted:\n \n.     Tis true, my children,\n.     My chosen ones,\n.     That I will forever watch over you\n.     As I have this time.\n.     But go now,\n.     And show others my {WLight{x,\n.     And build upon our already strong family,\n.     So that our future victories will be\n.     Even more numerous and glorious\n.     Than they are now.\n \nThus He spake unto His children through His chosen priest, Soreca. And thus\nSoreca was chosen to go forth from that radiant tower to the farthest reaches\nof Boinga, enlightening others to His cause.\n \nAnd with time, their numbers grew strong. Soreca returned to the tower within\ntwo years, with a following of worshippers for His cause. Together they all\nlived and grew together, and bound themselves tightly to each other and to Him.\nTheir family lived and prospered in peace, until one day, when the Great Evil\nentered their home.\n \n~\nE\ndark~\n.                         The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n \nIndeed, the {DPlague{x had been there for some time, lying latent, rising in power\nslowly but surely. Insidously, he beguiled the leaders into giving higher rank\nthan he deserved. At first, to the loyal worshippers, he seemed harmless\nenough, he fought well in battle, and spoke kindly to his brothers.\n \nBut he lusted for power, he desired to change of the trusted ways of the\n{YZealots{x. The interrogations began: debates lasting hours on end, so bitter that\neven the bravest of warriors closed their ears and hoped for end. The\nquestioners were few, but strong. They relentlessly persisted, prying into the\nevil's {Mmind{x, {Rheart{x, and {Wsoul{x.\n \nAnd in this period, which is called the {DDark Age{x of {YZealot{x, there was so much\ndiscord sown within the clan that the very heavens, disturbed by the great\nturmoil struck down all the leaders. But The {WAlmighty{x calmed the {YZealots{x'\nfears, and filled them with hope again:\n \n(continued) ...type look 4\n \n~\nE\n4~\n.     My children,\n.     See now this living falsehood.\n.     Let it not reside inside your walls.\n.     I have seen the strength in you,\n.     To purify and believe\n.     Now purify this evil,\n.     Rid thyself of this sinister being.\n \nAnd so interrogations continued, and finally they purged the Great Evil,\nbranding him an infidel.\n \n.     Thank ye, O {WAlmighty{x\n.     Thou hast given us strength once more\n.     To fight off the {DPlague{x\n.     And show us the way\n.     To {WLight{x, once more.\n \nThus they purged the {DPlague{x which had seeped into their veins and tried to\ncorrupt their hearts. The {WAlmighty{x administered the medicine of truth and\n{WLight{x, and the disease shriveled and withered under its strength.\n \n~\nE\ngolden~\n.                      The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \nWith the fall of the Great Evil, a new leader was born. He was fair and just,\nand introduced changes with the greatest clarity. It was he who divided the\nBelievers into the {WLight{x, the {RHand{x, and the {DInquisitors{x. All forms of rank and\nstatus were done away with, and all lived in peace and equality, troubled not\nby the competition for higher rank.\n \nAnd now, in the {YGolden Age{x: we are prosperous, and our enemies trouble us\nnot. Our warriors are strong and valiant in battle, our priests carry forth His\nword to the farthest reaches of the land. Our tower is constantly expanding\nand stretching farther into the heavens. It is our stronghold, our temple, and\nour gateway into other worlds. From the top of it shines a bright {WLight{x, a\nbeacon to all the lands surrounding it, attracting Believers and followers from\nall around. We are thriving under His protection and guidance. We are His\nfuture and bear it into the future with great vigor and loyalty.\n \n.     May He watch you\n.     And save you\n.     And guide you\n.     And you will surely prosper.\n \n~\nE\ntable~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\ncontent~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\nlost~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nbible~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nZealot~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nholy~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nscripture~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\n#31811\nplaque zealot month~\nA plaque of ivory and gold hangs here.~\nA plaque of gold and ivory hangs here.~\nplaque~\nfurniture 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nE\nplaque zealot month~\nApril, 2000:  \nKing Poet, for his heart of GOLD.\nMay, 2000: \n[30  Elf  Sam] [Zealot/4] Halo Head Inquisitor of the Almighty for his \n                          dedication to the Zealot cause.\nJune, 2000: \n[26  Yinn  Ass] [Zealot /2] Apathy.................\n                            His undying loyalty to the Almighty is a beacon \n                            for us all to follow. \n~\n#31812\nfountain water~\na fountain~\nA small drinking fountain is here.~\nivory~\nfountain 0 0\n0 0 'milk' 0 0\n0 0 0 G\n#31813\nempty can of whup-ass~\nan empty can of whup-ass~\nAn empty can, marked with the label \"Whup-Ass\", lays on the ground before you, reminding you of your recent defeat.~\nwhup-ass~\ntrash BNT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 10 100 P\n#31814\nnt new thalos~\na swirling black mist~\n~\n~\nportal R P\n0 0 0 9506 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31815\nblood pool~\na pool of blood~\nA sanctified pool of blood is here.~\nblood~\nfountain AOY 0\n0 0 'blood' 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31816\npew empty space third row~\nan empty space in the third row~\nA row of intricately carved wooden pews are here.~\nwood~\nfurniture OY 0\n5 0 CFIL 100 100\n0 10000 0 P\n#31817\nholy forge~\nThe Holy Forge~\nYou stare in awe at the magnificent, Holy Forge.~\nmetal~\ntrash Y 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31818\ncot~\na swirling black mist~\n~\nmist~\nportal RTY P\n0 0 0 6023 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31819\nthrone gold~\na Throne of Gold~\nA Throne of Gold resides here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31820\nthrone black diamonds~\na Throne of Black Diamonds~\nA Throne of Black Diamonds collects energy here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31821\nThrone Silk Jewels~\na Throne of Silk and Jewels~\nA Throne of Silk and Jewels exists here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31822\nPit of useful stuff~\nA Pit of useful stuff~\nA pit of useful stuff for clanmates is here.~\nMarble~\ncontainer Y 0\n10000 0 0 1000 100\n0 0 0 P\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#31800\nEntrance to the Almighty's Church~\nThose having gained the favor of The Almighty are permitted\nentrance into His grand Church.

The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n \nThe Southern gates of the ancient city of Ofcol had now fallen below the\nhorizon.  A place to rest her weary feet was all that Zelaca could think about.\nIt was only a day ago that Naczar, Usurper of Ofcol, had banished Zelaca and\nher three score of brethren, The {YZealots{x, out of Ofcol.  Now, the wanderers\nwere without any place to wander to: already having been exiled from every\nknown settlement in Boinga, just for claiming to have had visions of more\npowerful an entity than the ruling kings had ever seen with their own eyes:\nThe {WAlmighty{x.\n \nBut, The {WAlmighty{x would not let his chosen be without shelter, for only they\nwere gifted with the knowledge of the celestial secrets binding the heavens and\nthe earth.  They were not ready to die off after all they had labored for.  Up\nto this point, the Order of {YZealot{x has never ceased to exist, not for a moment.\nAnd after Zelaca we find an uninterupted sequence of prophets of the Order down\nto our own time, and if the name and seat of the true ruling prophet who guides\nits sublime labors remain a mystery today, an impenetrable secret known only to\nthe true believers, it is because the hour of the Order has not struck and the\ntime is not ripe.\n \ncontinued.......type look 1  (one...not an \"l\")\n \n~\nE\n1~\nWith the help of the elven monks from the Valley to the northeast, a great\nstone altar of sacrifice was born at the base of Mount Olympus.  Arrayed in\nwhite linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of\nthe altar making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the {WAlmighty{x:\nand when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and\ninstruments of music, and praised the {WAlmighty{x, singing:\n \n.     For He is good.\n.     For His mercy endureth forever.\n.     Rise Ye {WAlmighty{x, come hither to thine altar.\n.     Ye and thy ark of power.\n.     Thy priests, {WAlmighty{x God, are vested in salvation,\n.     Thy faithful rejoice in prosperity.\n \nAnd their songs were heard.  A grand pillar of {rfire{x descended from atop the\ngreat mountain to heed their prayers, and The {WAlmighty{x spoketh:\n \n.     Rest thy weary feet, Believers,\n.     For here you will rest,\n.     And worship thy lord for eternity.\n.     Guided by my eternal {WLight{x,\n.     Thy children, and their children\n.     Who follow will be granted purity\n.

And fifty cubits in diameter.\n \nAnd with the word of The {WAlmighty{x, it was done.  A {ygolden{x archway to the\nheavens, built with the architectural splendor and grandeur that the secrets of\nthe Order contain.  For this tower tells the story and struggles of a people\nwho are truly enlightened, and true believers.  It is the {WLight{x and {RHand{x of The\n{WAlmighty{x that has given his children a home.  A home which used to be a place\nof exile.\n \n(continued)....type look 2 \n \n~\nE\n2~\nIt is the {WLight{x, for the tower shone with a radiance not of this world. Men and\nbeasts alike were drawn to its holy splendor by a force unknown to them. But\nThe {WAlmighty{x knew what power lay in that tower, and the heavenly light from\nit filled the Believers with hope, courage, and devotion.\n \nAnd it is the {RHand{x, for housed inside the pillar of heaven were the noble\nwarriors, crusaders devoted to His cause, and courageous through His blessing.\nAnd the {RHand{x, with His unspoken word, descended mightily upon those who defied\nHim and defended His honor and glory with each and every finger.\n \n \n~\nE\nexpansion~\n.                         Growth and Expansion\n \nThe tower was constructed close to Ofcol, a monument of defiance that bore no\nless strength than Captain Jacklyn, whose liberating army marched on Ofcol and\noverthew Nazcar but one calendar year later. And on that day there was much\ncelebration banquets, festivals, music, and gaity reigned. In the halls of the\n{YZealots{x much praying took place, and devotees thanked The {WAlmighty{x for granting\nthe power to vanquish the evil usurper.\n \n.     O heavenly lord!\n.     Upon this great day we thank thee\n.     For Ye hath given us strength\n.     And Ye hath given us courage\n.     And Ye hath shown us the way to truth\n.     Through thineself.\n \n(continued) .....type look 3\n \n~\nE\n3~\nAnd hearing these prayers, He answered through a young disciple, Soreca, who\nhad seemed to Him especially devoted:\n \n.     Tis true, my children,\n.     My chosen ones,\n.     That I will forever watch over you\n.     As I have this time.\n.     But go now,\n.     And show others my {WLight{x,\n.     And build upon our already strong family,\n.     So that our future victories will be\n.     Even more numerous and glorious\n.     Than they are now.\n \nThus He spake unto His children through His chosen priest, Soreca. And thus\nSoreca was chosen to go forth from that radiant tower to the farthest reaches\nof Boinga, enlightening others to His cause.\n \nAnd with time, their numbers grew strong. Soreca returned to the tower within\ntwo years, with a following of worshippers for His cause. Together they all\nlived and grew together, and bound themselves tightly to each other and to Him.\nTheir family lived and prospered in peace, until one day, when the Great Evil\nentered their home.\n \n~\nE\ndark~\n.                         The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n \nIndeed, the {DPlague{x had been there for some time, lying latent, rising in power\nslowly but surely. Insidously, he beguiled the leaders into giving higher rank\nthan he deserved. At first, to the loyal worshippers, he seemed harmless\nenough, he fought well in battle, and spoke kindly to his brothers.\n \nBut he lusted for power, he desired to change of the trusted ways of the\n{YZealots{x. The interrogations began: debates lasting hours on end, so bitter that\neven the bravest of warriors closed their ears and hoped for end. The\nquestioners were few, but strong. They relentlessly persisted, prying into the\nevil's {Mmind{x, {Rheart{x, and {Wsoul{x.\n \nAnd in this period, which is called the {DDark Age{x of {YZealot{x, there was so much\ndiscord sown within the clan that the very heavens, disturbed by the great\nturmoil struck down all the leaders. But The {WAlmighty{x calmed the {YZealots{x'\nfears, and filled them with hope again:\n \n(continued) ...type look 4\n \n~\nE\n4~\n.     My children,\n.     See now this living falsehood.\n.     Let it not reside inside your walls.\n.     I have seen the strength in you,\n.     To purify and believe\n.     Now purify this evil,\n.     Rid thyself of this sinister being.\n \nAnd so interrogations continued, and finally they purged the Great Evil,\nbranding him an infidel.\n \n.     Thank ye, O {WAlmighty{x\n.     Thou hast given us strength once more\n.     To fight off the {DPlague{x\n.     And show us the way\n.     To {WLight{x, once more.\n \nThus they purged the {DPlague{x which had seeped into their veins and tried to\ncorrupt their hearts. The {WAlmighty{x administered the medicine of truth and\n{WLight{x, and the disease shriveled and withered under its strength.\n \n~\nE\ngolden~\n.                      The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \nWith the fall of the Great Evil, a new leader was born. He was fair and just,\nand introduced changes with the greatest clarity. It was he who divided the\nBelievers into the {WLight{x, the {RHand{x, and the {DInquisitors{x. All forms of rank and\nstatus were done away with, and all lived in peace and equality, troubled not\nby the competition for higher rank.\n \nAnd now, in the {YGolden Age{x: we are prosperous, and our enemies trouble us\nnot. Our warriors are strong and valiant in battle, our priests carry forth His\nword to the farthest reaches of the land. Our tower is constantly expanding\nand stretching farther into the heavens. It is our stronghold, our temple, and\nour gateway into other worlds. From the top of it shines a bright {WLight{x, a\nbeacon to all the lands surrounding it, attracting Believers and followers from\nall around. We are thriving under His protection and guidance. We are His\nfuture and bear it into the future with great vigor and loyalty.\n \n.     May He watch you\n.     And save you\n.     And guide you\n.     And you will surely prosper.\n \n~\nE\ntable~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\ncontent~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\nlost~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nbible~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nZealot~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nholy~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nscripture~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\n#31811\nplaque zealot month~\nA plaque of ivory and gold hangs here.~\nA plaque of gold and ivory hangs here.~\nplaque~\nfurniture 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nE\nplaque zealot month~\nApril, 2000:  \nKing Poet, for his heart of GOLD.\nMay, 2000: \n[30  Elf  Sam] [Zealot/4] Halo Head Inquisitor of the Almighty for his \n                          dedication to the Zealot cause.\nJune, 2000: \n[26  Yinn  Ass] [Zealot /2] Apathy.................\n                            His undying loyalty to the Almighty is a beacon \n                            for us all to follow. \n~\n#31812\nfountain water~\na fountain~\nA small drinking fountain is here.~\nivory~\nfountain 0 0\n0 0 'milk' 0 0\n0 0 0 G\n#31813\nempty can of whup-ass~\nan empty can of whup-ass~\nAn empty can, marked with the label \"Whup-Ass\", lays on the ground before you, reminding you of your recent defeat.~\nwhup-ass~\ntrash BNT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 10 100 P\n#31814\nnt new thalos~\na swirling black mist~\n~\n~\nportal R P\n0 0 0 9506 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31815\nblood pool~\na pool of blood~\nA sanctified pool of blood is here.~\nblood~\nfountain AOY 0\n0 0 'blood' 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31816\npew empty space third row~\nan empty space in the third row~\nA row of intricately carved wooden pews are here.~\nwood~\nfurniture OY 0\n5 0 CFIL 100 100\n0 10000 0 P\n#31817\nholy forge~\nThe Holy Forge~\nYou stare in awe at the magnificent, Holy Forge.~\nmetal~\ntrash Y 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31818\ncot~\na swirling black mist~\n~\nmist~\nportal RTY P\n0 0 0 6023 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31819\nthrone gold~\na Throne of Gold~\nA Throne of Gold resides here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31820\nthrone black diamonds~\na Throne of Black Diamonds~\nA Throne of Black Diamonds collects energy here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31821\nThrone Silk Jewels~\na Throne of Silk and Jewels~\nA Throne of Silk and Jewels exists here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31822\nPit of useful stuff~\nA Pit of useful stuff~\nA pit of useful stuff for clanmates is here.~\nMarble~\ncontainer Y 0\n10000 0 0 1000 100\n0 0 0 P\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#31800\nEntrance to the Almighty's Church~\nThose having gained the favor of The Almighty are permitted\nentrance into His grand Church.

Now, the wanderers\nwere without any place to wander to: already having been exiled from every\nknown settlement in Boinga, just for claiming to have had visions of more\npowerful an entity than the ruling kings had ever seen with their own eyes:\nThe {WAlmighty{x.\n \nBut, The {WAlmighty{x would not let his chosen be without shelter, for only they\nwere gifted with the knowledge of the celestial secrets binding the heavens and\nthe earth.  They were not ready to die off after all they had labored for.  Up\nto this point, the Order of {YZealot{x has never ceased to exist, not for a moment.\nAnd after Zelaca we find an uninterupted sequence of prophets of the Order down\nto our own time, and if the name and seat of the true ruling prophet who guides\nits sublime labors remain a mystery today, an impenetrable secret known only to\nthe true believers, it is because the hour of the Order has not struck and the\ntime is not ripe.\n \ncontinued.......type look 1  (one...not an \"l\")\n \n~\nE\n1~\nWith the help of the elven monks from the Valley to the northeast, a great\nstone altar of sacrifice was born at the base of Mount Olympus.  Arrayed in\nwhite linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of\nthe altar making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the {WAlmighty{x:\nand when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and\ninstruments of music, and praised the {WAlmighty{x, singing:\n \n.     For He is good.\n.     For His mercy endureth forever.\n.     Rise Ye {WAlmighty{x, come hither to thine altar.\n.     Ye and thy ark of power.\n.     Thy priests, {WAlmighty{x God, are vested in salvation,\n.     Thy faithful rejoice in prosperity.\n \nAnd their songs were heard.  A grand pillar of {rfire{x descended from atop the\ngreat mountain to heed their prayers, and The {WAlmighty{x spoketh:\n \n.     Rest thy weary feet, Believers,\n.     For here you will rest,\n.     And worship thy lord for eternity.\n.     Guided by my eternal {WLight{x,\n.     Thy children, and their children\n.     Who follow will be granted purity\n.     To hear my voice, for I am thy lord,\n.     The {WAlmighty{x, and they are my\n.     Children as well, the chosen.\n \n~\nE\ntower~\n.                          The Building of the Tower\n \n.     It is on this site\n.     Of this holy of the holiest,\n.     At this altar you have built before me,\n.     That I command you to erect a tower of worship,\n.     A bridge to the heavens.\n.     Made of {yacacia wood{x,\n.     Plated, inside and out, with pure {Ygold{x:\n.     One hundred cubits wide, by\n.     Ten thousand cubits high\n.     And fifty cubits in diameter.\n \nAnd with the word of The {WAlmighty{x, it was done.  A {ygolden{x archway to the\nheavens, built with the architectural splendor and grandeur that the secrets of\nthe Order contain.  For this tower tells the story and struggles of a people\nwho are truly enlightened, and true believers.  It is the {WLight{x and {RHand{x of The\n{WAlmighty{x that has given his children a home.  A home which used to be a place\nof exile.\n \n(continued)....type look 2 \n \n~\nE\n2~\nIt is the {WLight{x, for the tower shone with a radiance not of this world. Men and\nbeasts alike were drawn to its holy splendor by a force unknown to them. But\nThe {WAlmighty{x knew what power lay in that tower, and the heavenly light from\nit filled the Believers with hope, courage, and devotion.\n \nAnd it is the {RHand{x, for housed inside the pillar of heaven were the noble\nwarriors, crusaders devoted to His cause, and courageous through His blessing.\nAnd the {RHand{x, with His unspoken word, descended mightily upon those who defied\nHim and defended His honor and glory with each and every finger.\n \n \n~\nE\nexpansion~\n.                         Growth and Expansion\n \nThe tower was constructed close to Ofcol, a monument of defiance that bore no\nless strength than Captain Jacklyn, whose liberating army marched on Ofcol and\noverthew Nazcar but one calendar year later. And on that day there was much\ncelebration banquets, festivals, music, and gaity reigned. In the halls of the\n{YZealots{x much praying took place, and devotees thanked The {WAlmighty{x for granting\nthe power to vanquish the evil usurper.\n \n.     O heavenly lord!\n.     Upon this great day we thank thee\n.     For Ye hath given us strength\n.     And Ye hath given us courage\n.     And Ye hath shown us the way to truth\n.     Through thineself.\n \n(continued) .....type look 3\n \n~\nE\n3~\nAnd hearing these prayers, He answered through a young disciple, Soreca, who\nhad seemed to Him especially devoted:\n \n.     Tis true, my children,\n.     My chosen ones,\n.     That I will forever watch over you\n.     As I have this time.\n.     But go now,\n.     And show others my {WLight{x,\n.     And build upon our already strong family,\n.     So that our future victories will be\n.     Even more numerous and glorious\n.     Than they are now.\n \nThus He spake unto His children through His chosen priest, Soreca. And thus\nSoreca was chosen to go forth from that radiant tower to the farthest reaches\nof Boinga, enlightening others to His cause.\n \nAnd with time, their numbers grew strong. Soreca returned to the tower within\ntwo years, with a following of worshippers for His cause. Together they all\nlived and grew together, and bound themselves tightly to each other and to Him.\nTheir family lived and prospered in peace, until one day, when the Great Evil\nentered their home.\n \n~\nE\ndark~\n.                         The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n \nIndeed, the {DPlague{x had been there for some time, lying latent, rising in power\nslowly but surely. Insidously, he beguiled the leaders into giving higher rank\nthan he deserved. At first, to the loyal worshippers, he seemed harmless\nenough, he fought well in battle, and spoke kindly to his brothers.\n \nBut he lusted for power, he desired to change of the trusted ways of the\n{YZealots{x. The interrogations began: debates lasting hours on end, so bitter that\neven the bravest of warriors closed their ears and hoped for end. The\nquestioners were few, but strong. They relentlessly persisted, prying into the\nevil's {Mmind{x, {Rheart{x, and {Wsoul{x.\n \nAnd in this period, which is called the {DDark Age{x of {YZealot{x, there was so much\ndiscord sown within the clan that the very heavens, disturbed by the great\nturmoil struck down all the leaders. But The {WAlmighty{x calmed the {YZealots{x'\nfears, and filled them with hope again:\n \n(continued) ...type look 4\n \n~\nE\n4~\n.     My children,\n.     See now this living falsehood.\n.     Let it not reside inside your walls.\n.     I have seen the strength in you,\n.     To purify and believe\n.     Now purify this evil,\n.     Rid thyself of this sinister being.\n \nAnd so interrogations continued, and finally they purged the Great Evil,\nbranding him an infidel.\n \n.     Thank ye, O {WAlmighty{x\n.     Thou hast given us strength once more\n.     To fight off the {DPlague{x\n.     And show us the way\n.     To {WLight{x, once more.\n \nThus they purged the {DPlague{x which had seeped into their veins and tried to\ncorrupt their hearts. The {WAlmighty{x administered the medicine of truth and\n{WLight{x, and the disease shriveled and withered under its strength.\n \n~\nE\ngolden~\n.                      The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \nWith the fall of the Great Evil, a new leader was born. He was fair and just,\nand introduced changes with the greatest clarity. It was he who divided the\nBelievers into the {WLight{x, the {RHand{x, and the {DInquisitors{x. All forms of rank and\nstatus were done away with, and all lived in peace and equality, troubled not\nby the competition for higher rank.\n \nAnd now, in the {YGolden Age{x: we are prosperous, and our enemies trouble us\nnot. Our warriors are strong and valiant in battle, our priests carry forth His\nword to the farthest reaches of the land. Our tower is constantly expanding\nand stretching farther into the heavens. It is our stronghold, our temple, and\nour gateway into other worlds. From the top of it shines a bright {WLight{x, a\nbeacon to all the lands surrounding it, attracting Believers and followers from\nall around. We are thriving under His protection and guidance. We are His\nfuture and bear it into the future with great vigor and loyalty.\n \n.     May He watch you\n.     And save you\n.     And guide you\n.     And you will surely prosper.\n \n~\nE\ntable~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\ncontent~\nThe Lost Scripture\n \nBook of Prophets\n(Look origin)    Chapter 1   The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n(look 1)         Chapter 1   continued\n(look tower)     Chapter 2   The Building of the Tower\n(look 2)         Chapter 2   continued\n(Look expansion) Chapter 3   Growth and Expansion\n(look 3)         Chapter 3   continued\n(look dark)      Chapter 4   The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n(look 4)         Chapter 4   continued\n \nBook of Kings\n(look golden)    Chapter 1   The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \ntype look ***** to read the appropriate sections\n \n~\nE\nlost~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nbible~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nZealot~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nholy~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\nE\nscripture~\nYou should look at the table of contents.\ntype look table or look content\n \n~\n#31811\nplaque zealot month~\nA plaque of ivory and gold hangs here.~\nA plaque of gold and ivory hangs here.~\nplaque~\nfurniture 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nE\nplaque zealot month~\nApril, 2000:  \nKing Poet, for his heart of GOLD.\nMay, 2000: \n[30  Elf  Sam] [Zealot/4] Halo Head Inquisitor of the Almighty for his \n                          dedication to the Zealot cause.\nJune, 2000: \n[26  Yinn  Ass] [Zealot /2] Apathy.................\n                            His undying loyalty to the Almighty is a beacon \n                            for us all to follow. \n~\n#31812\nfountain water~\na fountain~\nA small drinking fountain is here.~\nivory~\nfountain 0 0\n0 0 'milk' 0 0\n0 0 0 G\n#31813\nempty can of whup-ass~\nan empty can of whup-ass~\nAn empty can, marked with the label \"Whup-Ass\", lays on the ground before you, reminding you of your recent defeat.~\nwhup-ass~\ntrash BNT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 10 100 P\n#31814\nnt new thalos~\na swirling black mist~\n~\n~\nportal R P\n0 0 0 9506 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31815\nblood pool~\na pool of blood~\nA sanctified pool of blood is here.~\nblood~\nfountain AOY 0\n0 0 'blood' 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31816\npew empty space third row~\nan empty space in the third row~\nA row of intricately carved wooden pews are here.~\nwood~\nfurniture OY 0\n5 0 CFIL 100 100\n0 10000 0 P\n#31817\nholy forge~\nThe Holy Forge~\nYou stare in awe at the magnificent, Holy Forge.~\nmetal~\ntrash Y 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31818\ncot~\na swirling black mist~\n~\nmist~\nportal RTY P\n0 0 0 6023 0\n0 10000 0 P\n#31819\nthrone gold~\na Throne of Gold~\nA Throne of Gold resides here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31820\nthrone black diamonds~\na Throne of Black Diamonds~\nA Throne of Black Diamonds collects energy here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31821\nThrone Silk Jewels~\na Throne of Silk and Jewels~\nA Throne of Silk and Jewels exists here.~\ngold~\nfurniture R 0\n1 0 BEHK 0 0\n0 100 0 P\n#31822\nPit of useful stuff~\nA Pit of useful stuff~\nA pit of useful stuff for clanmates is here.~\nMarble~\ncontainer Y 0\n10000 0 0 1000 100\n0 0 0 P\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#31800\nEntrance to the Almighty's Church~\nThose having gained the favor of The Almighty are permitted\nentrance into His grand Church.

The Origin of the {YZealots{x\n \nThe Southern gates of the ancient city of Ofcol had now fallen below the\nhorizon.  A place to rest her weary feet was all that Zelaca could think about.\nIt was only a day ago that Naczar, Usurper of Ofcol, had banished Zelaca and\nher three score of brethren, The {YZealots{x, out of Ofcol.  Now, the wanderers\nwere without any place to wander to: already having been exiled from every\nknown settlement in Boinga, just for claiming to have had visions of more\npowerful an entity than the ruling kings had ever seen with their own eyes:\nThe {WAlmighty{x.\n \nBut, The {WAlmighty{x would not let his chosen be without shelter, for only they\nwere gifted with the knowledge of the celestial secrets binding the heavens and\nthe earth.  They were not ready to die off after all they had labored for.  Up\nto this point, the Order of {YZealot{x has never ceased to exist, not for a moment.\nAnd after Zelaca we find an uninterupted sequence of prophets of the Order down\nto our own time, and if the name and seat of the true ruling prophet who guides\nits sublime labors remain a mystery today, an impenetrable secret known only to\nthe true believers, it is because the hour of the Order has not struck and the\ntime is not ripe.\n \ncontinued.......type look 1  (one...not an \"l\")\n \n~\nE\n1~\nWith the help of the elven monks from the Valley to the northeast, a great\nstone altar of sacrifice was born at the base of Mount Olympus.  Arrayed in\nwhite linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of\nthe altar making one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the {WAlmighty{x:\nand when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and\ninstruments of music, and praised the {WAlmighty{x, singing:\n \n.     For He is good.\n.     For His mercy endureth forever.\n.     Rise Ye {WAlmighty{x, come hither to thine altar.\n.     Ye and thy ark of power.\n.     Thy priests, {WAlmighty{x God, are vested in salvation,\n.     Thy faithful rejoice in prosperity.\n \nAnd their songs were heard.  A grand pillar of {rfire{x descended from atop the\ngreat mountain to heed their prayers, and The {WAlmighty{x spoketh:\n \n.     Rest thy weary feet, Believers,\n.     For here you will rest,\n.     And worship thy lord for eternity.\n.     Guided by my eternal {WLight{x,\n.     Thy children, and their children\n.     Who follow will be granted purity\n.     To hear my voice, for I am thy lord,\n.     The {WAlmighty{x, and they are my\n.     Children as well, the chosen.\n \n~\nE\ntower~\n.                          The Building of the Tower\n \n.     It is on this site\n.     Of this holy of the holiest,\n.     At this altar you have built before me,\n.     That I command you to erect a tower of worship,\n.     A bridge to the heavens.\n.     Made of {yacacia wood{x,\n.     Plated, inside and out, with pure {Ygold{x:\n.     One hundred cubits wide, by\n.     Ten thousand cubits high\n.     And fifty cubits in diameter.\n \nAnd with the word of The {WAlmighty{x, it was done.  A {ygolden{x archway to the\nheavens, built with the architectural splendor and grandeur that the secrets of\nthe Order contain.  For this tower tells the story and struggles of a people\nwho are truly enlightened, and true believers.  It is the {WLight{x and {RHand{x of The\n{WAlmighty{x that has given his children a home.  A home which used to be a place\nof exile.\n \n(continued)....type look 2 \n \n~\nE\n2~\nIt is the {WLight{x, for the tower shone with a radiance not of this world. Men and\nbeasts alike were drawn to its holy splendor by a force unknown to them. But\nThe {WAlmighty{x knew what power lay in that tower, and the heavenly light from\nit filled the Believers with hope, courage, and devotion.\n \nAnd it is the {RHand{x, for housed inside the pillar of heaven were the noble\nwarriors, crusaders devoted to His cause, and courageous through His blessing.\nAnd the {RHand{x, with His unspoken word, descended mightily upon those who defied\nHim and defended His honor and glory with each and every finger.\n \n \n~\nE\nexpansion~\n.                         Growth and Expansion\n \nThe tower was constructed close to Ofcol, a monument of defiance that bore no\nless strength than Captain Jacklyn, whose liberating army marched on Ofcol and\noverthew Nazcar but one calendar year later. And on that day there was much\ncelebration banquets, festivals, music, and gaity reigned. In the halls of the\n{YZealots{x much praying took place, and devotees thanked The {WAlmighty{x for granting\nthe power to vanquish the evil usurper.\n \n.     O heavenly lord!\n.     Upon this great day we thank thee\n.     For Ye hath given us strength\n.     And Ye hath given us courage\n.     And Ye hath shown us the way to truth\n.     Through thineself.\n \n(continued) .....type look 3\n \n~\nE\n3~\nAnd hearing these prayers, He answered through a young disciple, Soreca, who\nhad seemed to Him especially devoted:\n \n.     Tis true, my children,\n.     My chosen ones,\n.     That I will forever watch over you\n.     As I have this time.\n.     But go now,\n.     And show others my {WLight{x,\n.     And build upon our already strong family,\n.     So that our future victories will be\n.     Even more numerous and glorious\n.     Than they are now.\n \nThus He spake unto His children through His chosen priest, Soreca. And thus\nSoreca was chosen to go forth from that radiant tower to the farthest reaches\nof Boinga, enlightening others to His cause.\n \nAnd with time, their numbers grew strong. Soreca returned to the tower within\ntwo years, with a following of worshippers for His cause. Together they all\nlived and grew together, and bound themselves tightly to each other and to Him.\nTheir family lived and prospered in peace, until one day, when the Great Evil\nentered their home.\n \n~\nE\ndark~\n.                         The {DPlague{x and the {DDark Age{x\n \nIndeed, the {DPlague{x had been there for some time, lying latent, rising in power\nslowly but surely. Insidously, he beguiled the leaders into giving higher rank\nthan he deserved. At first, to the loyal worshippers, he seemed harmless\nenough, he fought well in battle, and spoke kindly to his brothers.\n \nBut he lusted for power, he desired to change of the trusted ways of the\n{YZealots{x. The interrogations began: debates lasting hours on end, so bitter that\neven the bravest of warriors closed their ears and hoped for end. The\nquestioners were few, but strong. They relentlessly persisted, prying into the\nevil's {Mmind{x, {Rheart{x, and {Wsoul{x.\n \nAnd in this period, which is called the {DDark Age{x of {YZealot{x, there was so much\ndiscord sown within the clan that the very heavens, disturbed by the great\nturmoil struck down all the leaders. But The {WAlmighty{x calmed the {YZealots{x'\nfears, and filled them with hope again:\n \n(continued) ...type look 4\n \n~\nE\n4~\n.     My children,\n.     See now this living falsehood.\n.     Let it not reside inside your walls.\n.     I have seen the strength in you,\n.     To purify and believe\n.     Now purify this evil,\n.     Rid thyself of this sinister being.\n \nAnd so interrogations continued, and finally they purged the Great Evil,\nbranding him an infidel.\n \n.     Thank ye, O {WAlmighty{x\n.     Thou hast given us strength once more\n.     To fight off the {DPlague{x\n.     And show us the way\n.     To {WLight{x, once more.\n \nThus they purged the {DPlague{x which had seeped into their veins and tried to\ncorrupt their hearts. The {WAlmighty{x administered the medicine of truth and\n{WLight{x, and the disease shriveled and withered under its strength.\n \n~\nE\ngolden~\n.                      The {YGolden Age{x of {YZealot{x\n \nWith the fall of the Great Evil, a new leader was born. He was fair and just,\nand introduced changes with the greatest clarity. It was he who divided the\nBelievers into the {WLight{x, the {RHand{x, and the {DInquisitors{x. All forms of rank and\nstatus were done away with, and all lived in peace and equality, troubled not\nby the competition for higher rank.\n \nAnd now, in the {YGolden Age{x: we are prosperous, and our enemies trouble us\nnot. Our warriors are strong and valiant in battle, our priests carry forth His\nword to the farthest reaches of the land. Our tower is constantly expanding\nand stretching farther into the heavens. It is our stronghold, our temple, and\nour gateway into other worlds.

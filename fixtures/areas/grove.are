There are three\nempty frames labeled 'The Chimerical', 'The Mythical' and 'The Hypothetical',\nA panoramic picture of Strabo flying between the worlds dominate one wall, \nwhile a dragons-eye view of Pern (with dragons in the foreground, of course) \nfills another. There even are a few rare medieval renditions of the great \nbeast of the Revelation. Over the head of the table hangs a rather modest \nportrait of a silver Dragon, sparkling with blue lightening, looking amused.\n~\nS\n#8919\nThe terrace~\nYou are standing on a sunlit terrace in front of Dragon's mansion. To the\nwest, there is a splendid view over the field down over the lake. To the north\nis the greenhouse, its large windowpanes shimmering with weird and wonderful\ncolors, while a double door leads into the house proper to the east. It is\nwarm and calm here. There is a white-painted table with a parasol here,\ntogether with a matched set of chairs.\n~\n0 CD 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 -1 8917\nD1\nExit ~\ndouble door~\n16387 -1 8918\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 8908\nS\n#8950\nAt the edge of the grove~\nYou are standing at the entrace of a beautiful grove of trees, and your\nheart is filled with pure, peaceful thoughts.

You feel seasons of\nremembered happiness and joy taking Your sorrows and worries away from You,\nleaving You calm and invigorated, ready for the world. Paths lead into the\nholy grove to the east, north and west, while to the south a wide, sunny field\nslopes down to a sparkling lake.  Above you is a strange shimmering, almost\nlike something from another world....\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 8902\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 8906\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 8908\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 8904\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 9000\nS\n#8906\nThe holy grove~\nYou are standing amidst the ancient oaks and poplars in the holy grove.

There is a\nfragrance of spring in the air, a sound of summer and a feeling of eternal\nSaturday afternoon. To the south is a clear, sparkling lake, and to the north\nand west is the holy grove. In the wood's edge, to the east, is a stately man-\nsion, shimmering softly through the colors of the rainbow. You feel as if You\ncould spend the rest of your life here, lying on your back and looking at the\npatterns of the clouds as they gently drift across the sky.\n~\n0 D 2\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 8905\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 8919\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 8907\nE\nmansion~\nThe mansion is a sprawling, two-story affair with three wings, where the top\nof one wing serves as balcony.

There is a winding stone path leading\nfrom the wood's edge to the north, to the softly shimmering, rainbow-colored\nmansion to the south.

The\nwalls are (surprise!) blue, and the rest of the room is decorated in similar\nshades, producing a very nice, cool effect.

Contrary to popular\nbelief, He *doesn't* eat virgins, which is amply demonstrated by the large\nvariety of foodstuffs found here on the shelves. There are numerous cans of\ntomatoes, peas, corn etc., vines of garlic, a *Huge* array of small spice jars\nalong several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and\nstove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less\nthan meticulous housekeeper...

Green light filters in slantwise through the\nplants, giving the room a subtropical ambience. It is not really hot in here,\nthough, rather a pleasantly warm temperature. The walls are all windows, except \nthe eastern one joining the greenhouse to the main building, but it is hard to \nsee out for all the greenery here.

There are three\nempty frames labeled 'The Chimerical', 'The Mythical' and 'The Hypothetical',\nA panoramic picture of Strabo flying between the worlds dominate one wall, \nwhile a dragons-eye view of Pern (with dragons in the foreground, of course) \nfills another. There even are a few rare medieval renditions of the great \nbeast of the Revelation. Over the head of the table hangs a rather modest \nportrait of a silver Dragon, sparkling with blue lightening, looking amused.\n~\nS\n#8919\nThe terrace~\nYou are standing on a sunlit terrace in front of Dragon's mansion. To the\nwest, there is a splendid view over the field down over the lake. To the north\nis the greenhouse, its large windowpanes shimmering with weird and wonderful\ncolors, while a double door leads into the house proper to the east. It is\nwarm and calm here.

Strange blue algae gives off enough\nillumination to light the area.  The first thing that catches your eye is\na large tapestry on the north wall.  It depicts a terrible rat-like face\nwith huge, blood-stained teeth and glaring, beady little eyes.  It is more\nthan a little disturbing.  Set into the wall, under the tapestry, is what\nappears to be some sort of altar.  It too looks blood stained.\nThe only other exit seems to have been blocked by a rock fall.

Overstuffed chairs and couches clutter the floor.  Brass oil\nlamps illuminate, tapestries and oil paintings hanging on the walls.\nA large fireplace burns specially scented logs.  The logs never seem to\nbe consumed by the flames.\n~\n0 D 0\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23028\nS\n#23030\nFront Hall~\nThis was once a magnificent entry hall.  It is in need of some repair now.\nCobwebs cover the ceiling, mud cakes the floor and large grooves mark the\nwalls.

Now, it is a huge pile\nof firewood (although it is nice firewood).  The rest of the room is \ndecorated with tapestries and pictures of various woodland scenes.  The\naffect is, or would have been, quite nice if it wasn't for the blood\nstains covering most of the art.

Darkly stained\nwooden panels line the walls.  A matching wooden desk dominates the centre\nof the room.  Crystal glass windows give you a view of part of the city\nand the surrounding woods.  Whoever owns this office must be very powerful.\nHe might be here so you can find out for yourself.\nThe only obvious exit is south.\n~\n0 D 0\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23034\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16487 23010 23045\nE\ndoor~\nThe door looks a little strange.

Huge, gleaming white\npillars line the entrance. Inside, banks of computer screens cover the\nwalls, apparently to monitor world crime. Right now, however, all the\nscreens seem to be showing various cartoons.\nYanni, Barney and other known evil-doers hang from ropes suspended from\nthe ceiling.

There is some dry ground\naround the edges of the cave.  It looks like someone (or something) has\nmade this their home.  Perhaps you shouldn't linger here too long in\ncase they come back.  From the middle of the water you can see some sort of\nbox lying on the rocks to the south.  The only other way out seems to be\ndiving back underwater and swimming back up the tunnel.\n~\n0 D 7\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23044\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23040\nS\n#23042\nOut to Sea~\nVenturing farther out to sea you have almost lost sight of the docks to\nthe north.

There is a small, iron-bound chest here.

The white marble\nwalls glisten softly in the candle light.  The candles are held by \ngargoyle wall sconces.  Their eyes glitter and their wings appear to \nflutter as if they are trying to escape the polished, black basalt\nwhich lines the centre of the walls.  Marble benches form rows to each\nside of the room.  A golden chandelier casts halos accross the walls. \nAn ornate altar of gold sits at the end of the room.  A chalice burning\nincense sits on each side.  Wisps of smoke drift up to the majestic\nimage of Mojo.  A gurgling fountain springs from each of Mojo's open \npalms.  His left hand cradles one of pure clean water, the other hand\nholds a fountain of wine.

The walls are\nlined with bookshelves containing tomes of arcane magicks.  In the centre\nof the room, you see an orchestral pit with instruments hovering in \nmid-air.  On the north wall, a black marble fireplace is blazing with a \nlarge fire, heating Handel's entire study.  On the mantle, you see a \nfluffy white cat that hisses at you when you look in her direction.\nA mahogany couch is located in front of the fireplace, beckoning\nyou to rest you weary feet.\n~\n0 CDKPS 0\nH 500 M 500\nS\n#23050\nOn the Road~\nAn old dirt road winds it's way through the forest.

Darkly stained\nwooden panels line the walls.  A matching wooden desk dominates the centre\nof the room.  Crystal glass windows give you a view of part of the city\nand the surrounding woods.  Whoever owns this office must be very powerful.\nHe might be here so you can find out for yourself.\nThe only obvious exit is south.\n~\n0 D 0\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23034\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16487 23010 23045\nE\ndoor~\nThe door looks a little strange.  It seems to glow slightly and there\nis a mysterious ruin or ward carved into the frame.\n~\nS\n#23036\nWine Cellar~\nMaking your way down the narrow, rickety stairs you find yourself in a \nsmall dry cellar.  Casks and wine racks line the walls.  The casks have\nall been smashed open and only a couple of bottles are left intact on\nthe racks.  The only exit appears to be the stairs you came down.\n~\n0 ADJ 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23031\nS\n#23037\nJustice League of America~\nYou have arrived at the Justice League of America. Huge, gleaming white\npillars line the entrance. Inside, banks of computer screens cover the\nwalls, apparently to monitor world crime. Right now, however, all the\nscreens seem to be showing various cartoons.\nYanni, Barney and other known evil-doers hang from ropes suspended from\nthe ceiling.  A small sign saying \"Let this be a lesson to you all\"\nis posted near by.\n~\n0 CDPT 0\nM 600\nS\n#23038\nUnder the Dock~\nYou enter the dark, murky water with a splash.  It looks like there may\nbe some kind of tunnel entrance into the stone the docks are built\nupon.  It looks kind of dangerous to go deeper into the water though.\nPerhaps you should return to the dock.\n~\n0 0 7\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23039\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23042\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23008\nS\n#23039\nUnderwater Tunnel~\nSwimming further into the tunnel the water closes completely about you.\nFrom here you can go back towards the, relative, safety of the docks or\ncontinue deeper into the tunnel.

Up ahead it seems to widen\ninto some sort of cavern.  It looks like there are several large shapes \nmoving around in the cavern.  It might be safer to swim back to the surface.\n~\n0 D 7\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23039\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23041\nS\n#23041\nUnderwater Cavern~\nYou have entered into a large underground cavern.  There is some dry ground\naround the edges of the cave.  It looks like someone (or something) has\nmade this their home.  Perhaps you shouldn't linger here too long in\ncase they come back.  From the middle of the water you can see some sort of\nbox lying on the rocks to the south.  The only other way out seems to be\ndiving back underwater and swimming back up the tunnel.\n~\n0 D 7\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23044\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23040\nS\n#23042\nOut to Sea~\nVenturing farther out to sea you have almost lost sight of the docks to\nthe north.  Looking south you see some kind of large swirling whirlpool.\nIn fact it feels like you are being pulled towards the south.  Perhaps\nyou should swim back to the docks.\n~\n0 0 7\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23038\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23043\nS\n#23043\nSpinning in the Whirlpool~\nYou have lost control of your movements as you get caught up in the huge,\nswirling whirlpool.

There is a small, iron-bound chest here.  Though\nthe iron bands look somewhat rusted, the lock appears to be in good\ncondition still.\nThe only exit is north, back into the pool.\n~\n0 0 7\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 23041\nS\n#23045\nLord Boarish's Treasure Room~\nThis small secret room seems to contain Lord Boarish's treasure hoard.\n(Not much of a hoard really.

The white marble\nwalls glisten softly in the candle light.  The candles are held by \ngargoyle wall sconces.  Their eyes glitter and their wings appear to \nflutter as if they are trying to escape the polished, black basalt\nwhich lines the centre of the walls.  Marble benches form rows to each\nside of the room.  A golden chandelier casts halos accross the walls. \nAn ornate altar of gold sits at the end of the room.  A chalice burning\nincense sits on each side.  Wisps of smoke drift up to the majestic\nimage of Mojo.  A gurgling fountain springs from each of Mojo's open \npalms.  His left hand cradles one of pure clean water, the other hand\nholds a fountain of wine.  This room is filled with his presence and\nhis blessing.\n~\n0 CDKU 0\nS\n#23048\nTesting Arena~\nThis is a place that MObs get tested, before they end up in the game.\n~\n0 CDP 0\nS\n#23049\nHandel's Study~\nYou are encompased by a beam of light!\n \nWhen it dissipates, and your vision returns, you are in a large study.\nYou quickly survey the vast room and find no visible exits.  The walls are\nlined with bookshelves containing tomes of arcane magicks.  In the centre\nof the room, you see an orchestral pit with instruments hovering in \nmid-air.  On the north wall, a black marble fireplace is blazing with a \nlarge fire, heating Handel's entire study.  On the mantle, you see a \nfluffy white cat that hisses at you when you look in her direction.\nA mahogany couch is located in front of the fireplace, beckoning\nyou to rest you weary feet.\n~\n0 CDKPS 0\nH 500 M 500\nS\n#23050\nOn the Road~\nAn old dirt road winds it's way through the forest.

Strange blue algae gives off enough\nillumination to light the area.  The first thing that catches your eye is\na large tapestry on the north wall.  It depicts a terrible rat-like face\nwith huge, blood-stained teeth and glaring, beady little eyes.  It is more\nthan a little disturbing.  Set into the wall, under the tapestry, is what\nappears to be some sort of altar.  It too looks blood stained.\nThe only other exit seems to have been blocked by a rock fall.

Marble benches form rows to each\nside of the room.  A golden chandelier casts halos accross the walls. \nAn ornate altar of gold sits at the end of the room.  A chalice burning\nincense sits on each side.  Wisps of smoke drift up to the majestic\nimage of Mojo.  A gurgling fountain springs from each of Mojo's open \npalms.

On the north wall, a black marble fireplace is blazing with a \nlarge fire, heating Handel's entire study.

wall, the ornately carved coatrack, the smoothness\nof the slate that tiles the floor, and the enormous rosewood desk\njust ahead of you.  The smoke from the flames spirals up, caught\nby an air current, along a flight of circular stairs that\ndoubtless lead to the private guest rooms.  To the side of the\nmanager's desk is a door marked simply 'Common Room' and to the\neast is an entranceway to a smoky, hazy barroom.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3802\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3801\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3808\nE\nornately coatrack~\nThe delicate tendrils that extend out as coathooks seem too\npretty and too fragile to possibly be put to any such mundane use\nas bearing a cloak or a coat.

Above it hang racks of glasses of\nall sizes for all drinks imaginable, and behind it stand bottles\ncontaining the means to formulate such drinks.\n\nAround the room stand about a half dozen small round oak tables,\nall etched with use but kept carefully clean.

Blond wood panelling has been set over\nstone walls, and candles burn at all four corners of the room\nwith adequate brilliance to light the area fully.

The smoke from the flames spirals up, caught\nby an air current, along a flight of circular stairs that\ndoubtless lead to the private guest rooms.  To the side of the\nmanager's desk is a door marked simply 'Common Room' and to the\neast is an entranceway to a smoky, hazy barroom.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3802\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3801\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3808\nE\nornately coatrack~\nThe delicate tendrils that extend out as coathooks seem too\npretty and too fragile to possibly be put to any such mundane use\nas bearing a cloak or a coat.

Blond wood panelling has been set over\nstone walls, and candles burn at all four corners of the room\nwith adequate brilliance to light the area fully.

The smoke from the flames spirals up, caught\nby an air current, along a flight of circular stairs that\ndoubtless lead to the private guest rooms.  To the side of the\nmanager's desk is a door marked simply 'Common Room' and to the\neast is an entranceway to a smoky, hazy barroom.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3802\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3801\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3808\nE\nornately coatrack~\nThe delicate tendrils that extend out as coathooks seem too\npretty and too fragile to possibly be put to any such mundane use\nas bearing a cloak or a coat.

Blond wood panelling has been set over\nstone walls, and candles burn at all four corners of the room\nwith adequate brilliance to light the area fully.

wall, the ornately carved coatrack, the smoothness\nof the slate that tiles the floor, and the enormous rosewood desk\njust ahead of you.  The smoke from the flames spirals up, caught\nby an air current, along a flight of circular stairs that\ndoubtless lead to the private guest rooms.  To the side of the\nmanager's desk is a door marked simply 'Common Room' and to the\neast is an entranceway to a smoky, hazy barroom.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3802\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3801\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3808\nE\nornately coatrack~\nThe delicate tendrils that extend out as coathooks seem too\npretty and too fragile to possibly be put to any such mundane use\nas bearing a cloak or a coat.  However, it must be the case,\ngiven that a bear pelt of about sixty pounds weight is hanging\nlightly off of one.\n~\nE\nslate tiles floor~\nThe floor is impeccably clean and tiled in a dull deep gray\nslate.\n~\nE\ntorches~\nThey light the entryway, and if you get too close, they blind you\nwith first smoke and then flames.\n~\nE\nstairs spiral~\nThe stairs are completely free from dirt, even if you scuff your\ndirty boots across them.  Their highly gleaming oaken surface is,\nyou suspect, protected by magic -- which imbues in you a suddenly\ngreater respect and touch of fear toward Archangelo.\n~\nS\n#3801\nThe Moonstone Inn Bar~\nA long walnut bar, shining with years of careful maintenance,\nstands along the eastern wall.  Above it hang racks of glasses of\nall sizes for all drinks imaginable, and behind it stand bottles\ncontaining the means to formulate such drinks.\n\nAround the room stand about a half dozen small round oak tables,\nall etched with use but kept carefully clean.  The air is heavy\nwith smoke both from burning tobacco and from the fireplace, near\nwhich are a pair of comfortable looking black leather chairs.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3803\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3800\nE\ntobacco burning~\nIt smells expensive, probably a halfling pipeweed blend.\n~\nE\nglasses racks~\nThere are glasses of every sort for every kind of drink you could\npossibly imagine hanging there, plus some shapes that don't lend\nthemselves to anything you can think of.\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nThe fireplace is composed of heavy dark stone -- dark either\nnaturally, or through scorching, you are uncertain.\n~\nE\nblack leather chairs~\nThey look well-worn, well-used, and to be owned by a man and a\nwoman of the most singularly frightening countenance you have\never experienced.  They chuckle richly to each other at your\napproach, and you back away.\n~\nS\n#3802\nThe Moonstone Inn Common Room~\nA dozen cotton-sheeted pallets and their extra blankets stacked\nin a corner largely fill this room.  There are a set of huge\ndouble doors halfway through the room that could evidently be\nused to cut the chamber in half, though they are solidly propped\nopen at present, and beyond them you can see more beds.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3805\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3800\nE\ndoors double~\nThey are of a solid oak, and you don't think you alone could budge them\nto close them.\n~\nS\n#3803\nThe Moonstone Bar~\nA half dozen or so largish tables populate this room, one bearing\nthe remains of someone's dinner on it.  Your own stomach rumbles\nat the thought and you look to the barmaid, wondering what\nfoodstuffs might be avaliable.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3860 3806\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3861 3804\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3801\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3802\nE\nremains dinner~\nIt looks like they had the fish and chips and enjoyed it a great\ndeal.\n~\nE\nlargish tables~\nYou estimate about a dozen people could comfortably seat\nthemselves in this room.\n~\nS\n#3804\nPrivate room Two in the Moonstone Inn~\nA pair of lamps with hand-blown green glass shades light this\nelegantly but simply appointed room.  A table of fine oak stands\nperfectly in the centre, with a dozen large black leather chairs\nplaced symmetrically around it.  Off to the side, though, is a\nmatched black leather couch, should you prefer a less\nbusinesslike encounter.  A liquor cabinet stands discreetly in\nthe northmost corner.\n~\n0 DJK 1\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3861 3803\nE\nlamps hand-blown green glass shades~\nAs you examine them, you realize that they aren't blown from\nglass as such, but from some crystal that must have been heated\nto an unimaginable temperature to have achieved such plasticity.\n~\nS\n#3805\nThe Moonstone Inn Common Room~\nBeds and blankets fill this section of the common room as well,\nwith two closed doors visible on the north wall.  You estimate\nabout a dozen people could occupy this section of the common room\nin comparative comfort, and observe that the innkeeper keeps his\nplace surprisingly clean.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3860 3806\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3802\nE\ntwo doors closed north n wall~\nThey seem to be changing rooms where you could discreetly remove\nyour armor and put on some nightwear.  However, as you approach\nthe doors, you hear muffled moaning and giggling sounds, and\ndiscover that the door is locked.  Perhaps you won't be changing\nin there any time soon.\n~\nS\n#3806\nPrivate room One in the Moonstone Inn~\nThree claw-footed blue-and-white striped couch stands flush to\nthree of the walls, and a burnished rosewood coffee table stands\nbefore each.  The room is well-lit by an indeterminate source,\nbut you have the sense of open air and sunlight coming from the\nnorthern window.  A liquor cabinet stands discreetly in the\ncorner.\n~\n0 DJK 1\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3860 3803\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3860 3805\nE\nnorthern window~\nLacy white curtains billow slightly from the glass, through which\nyou glimpse a brilliant yellow sun rising over stark black\nmountains.  As you move to try to open the window to see better,\nyou realize it is firmly sealed, and that the 'glass' is perhaps\nnot glass at all, but something beyond your means to shatter.\n~\nS\n#3807\nThe Moonstone Inn's Room Number One~\nThe ceiling of this room is high and vaulted, with the walls\npainted a delicate eggshell and trimmed in white.  A four poster\nbed with white silk sheets and huge fluffy pillows is to your\nleft; ahead of you a claw-footed bathtub is tucked into an\nalcove, a covered ice bucket standing next to it.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3862 3808\nE\nceiling~\nYou estimate it to be about a fifteen foot arch.\n~\nS\n#3808\nThe Moonstone Inn Second Floor Hallway~\nGreen glass globes flicker from the walls, illuminating the dark\nglossy panelling and the smooth slate floor.

As\nyou examine them longer, you notice that the light flitters\nimperceptibly about.\n~\nE\nslate tiles floor~\nThe floor is impeccably clean and tiled in a dull deep gray\nslate.\n~\nE\nstairs spiral~\nThe stairs are completely free from dirt, even if you scuff your\ndirty boots across them.  Their highly gleaming oaken surface is,\nyou suspect, protected by magic -- which imbues in you a suddenly\ngreater respect and touch of fear toward Archangelo.\n~\nS\n#3809\nThe Moonstone Inn's Room Number Two~\nYou step down dark green marble stairs into a sunken living room\narea, noting a luxuriously appointed bed on your right side, and\na matched marble-topped desk to your right side.  Heavy black\nvelvet curtains flank a window which looks down onto the street.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3863 3808\nE\nwindow street~\nYou notice a knight getting his pocket picked.\n~\nE\nheavy black velvet curtains~\nThey are of a deep soft richness that makes you want to stroke\nthem like they were a cat.\n~\nE\ndark green marble stairs~\nThey are veined with black and have recently been buffed to a\nblinding glare.\n~\nS\n#3810\nThe Moonstone Inn's Room Number Three~\nYou step lightly onto a plush royal blue carpet, your feet\nleaving no marks as you enter the room.  The walls are a pale\nblue with white trim, and the couch to your left is is a slightly\ndarker shade of blue velvet.  A small glass-topped coffee table\nstands next to the couch.  Off ahead of you is a bed done up in\nblue silk with white eyelet lace.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3864 3811\nE\nplush royal blue carpet~\nYou surmise that the carpet must be magically protected from\ndirtying.\n~\nS\n#3811\nThe Moonstone Inn Second Floor Hallway~\nGreen glass globes flicker from the walls, illuminating the dark\nglossy panelling and the smooth slate floor.

Cream cotton curtains flutter gently at the two tall\nwindows through which sunlight mysteriously ambiently lights the\nwhole room.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3865 3811\nE\nwindows sunlight~\nAs you examine closer, you realize that the windows are actually\na cleverly-constructed set of crystals designed to trap and\nrefocus the light so as to perfectly illuminate the room.\n~\nE\ncotton curtains~\nThey blow slightly in the draft from the windows.\n~\nE\nwalls cream-and-gold~\nThe meticulousness in the ordering of the pinstriping suggests\nthat either magic or inordinate skill was employed by the\npainter.\n~\nS\n#3813\nThe Moonstone Inn's Room Number Five~\nA thick rug, woven in an abstract pattern of blues and reds,\ncovers most of the floor.  Blond wood panelling has been set over\nstone walls, and candles burn at all four corners of the room\nwith adequate brilliance to light the area fully.  An enormous\nsunken bath, perhaps as much as seven feet long and four feet\nwide, occupies all that the carpet does not, and a comfortable\nlooking bed takes up another quarter of the room.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3866 3814\nE\ncandles~\nThey are of a sweet-smelling beeswax.\n~\nE\nblond wood panelling~\nEach panel is elegantly decorated, some with carving, others with\nblack inlay work.\n~\nE\nthick rug pattern blue red~\nAs you examine it, the pattern seems to resolve into something\nintelligible, but just before you manage to determine what, the\nknowledge slips from you again.\n~\nS\n#3814\nThe Moonstone Inn Second Floor Hallway~\nGreen glass globes flicker from the walls, illuminating the dark\nglossy panelling and the smooth slate floor.

The smoke from the flames spirals up, caught\nby an air current, along a flight of circular stairs that\ndoubtless lead to the private guest rooms.  To the side of the\nmanager's desk is a door marked simply 'Common Room' and to the\neast is an entranceway to a smoky, hazy barroom.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3802\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3801\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3808\nE\nornately coatrack~\nThe delicate tendrils that extend out as coathooks seem too\npretty and too fragile to possibly be put to any such mundane use\nas bearing a cloak or a coat.

Heavy black\nvelvet curtains flank a window which looks down onto the street.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3863 3808\nE\nwindow street~\nYou notice a knight getting his pocket picked.\n~\nE\nheavy black velvet curtains~\nThey are of a deep soft richness that makes you want to stroke\nthem like they were a cat.\n~\nE\ndark green marble stairs~\nThey are veined with black and have recently been buffed to a\nblinding glare.\n~\nS\n#3810\nThe Moonstone Inn's Room Number Three~\nYou step lightly onto a plush royal blue carpet, your feet\nleaving no marks as you enter the room.  The walls are a pale\nblue with white trim, and the couch to your left is is a slightly\ndarker shade of blue velvet.  A small glass-topped coffee table\nstands next to the couch.  Off ahead of you is a bed done up in\nblue silk with white eyelet lace.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3864 3811\nE\nplush royal blue carpet~\nYou surmise that the carpet must be magically protected from\ndirtying.\n~\nS\n#3811\nThe Moonstone Inn Second Floor Hallway~\nGreen glass globes flicker from the walls, illuminating the dark\nglossy panelling and the smooth slate floor.

Blond wood panelling has been set over\nstone walls, and candles burn at all four corners of the room\nwith adequate brilliance to light the area fully.  An enormous\nsunken bath, perhaps as much as seven feet long and four feet\nwide, occupies all that the carpet does not, and a comfortable\nlooking bed takes up another quarter of the room.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3866 3814\nE\ncandles~\nThey are of a sweet-smelling beeswax.\n~\nE\nblond wood panelling~\nEach panel is elegantly decorated, some with carving, others with\nblack inlay work.\n~\nE\nthick rug pattern blue red~\nAs you examine it, the pattern seems to resolve into something\nintelligible, but just before you manage to determine what, the\nknowledge slips from you again.\n~\nS\n#3814\nThe Moonstone Inn Second Floor Hallway~\nGreen glass globes flicker from the walls, illuminating the dark\nglossy panelling and the smooth slate floor.

wall, the ornately carved coatrack, the smoothness\nof the slate that tiles the floor, and the enormous rosewood desk\njust ahead of you.  The smoke from the flames spirals up, caught\nby an air current, along a flight of circular stairs that\ndoubtless lead to the private guest rooms.  To the side of the\nmanager's desk is a door marked simply 'Common Room' and to the\neast is an entranceway to a smoky, hazy barroom.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3802\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3801\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3808\nE\nornately coatrack~\nThe delicate tendrils that extend out as coathooks seem too\npretty and too fragile to possibly be put to any such mundane use\nas bearing a cloak or a coat.

Their highly gleaming oaken surface is,\nyou suspect, protected by magic -- which imbues in you a suddenly\ngreater respect and touch of fear toward Archangelo.\n~\nS\n#3801\nThe Moonstone Inn Bar~\nA long walnut bar, shining with years of careful maintenance,\nstands along the eastern wall.  Above it hang racks of glasses of\nall sizes for all drinks imaginable, and behind it stand bottles\ncontaining the means to formulate such drinks.\n\nAround the room stand about a half dozen small round oak tables,\nall etched with use but kept carefully clean.

A table of fine oak stands\nperfectly in the centre, with a dozen large black leather chairs\nplaced symmetrically around it.  Off to the side, though, is a\nmatched black leather couch, should you prefer a less\nbusinesslike encounter.  A liquor cabinet stands discreetly in\nthe northmost corner.\n~\n0 DJK 1\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3861 3803\nE\nlamps hand-blown green glass shades~\nAs you examine them, you realize that they aren't blown from\nglass as such, but from some crystal that must have been heated\nto an unimaginable temperature to have achieved such plasticity.\n~\nS\n#3805\nThe Moonstone Inn Common Room~\nBeds and blankets fill this section of the common room as well,\nwith two closed doors visible on the north wall.

Perhaps you won't be changing\nin there any time soon.\n~\nS\n#3806\nPrivate room One in the Moonstone Inn~\nThree claw-footed blue-and-white striped couch stands flush to\nthree of the walls, and a burnished rosewood coffee table stands\nbefore each.  The room is well-lit by an indeterminate source,\nbut you have the sense of open air and sunlight coming from the\nnorthern window.  A liquor cabinet stands discreetly in the\ncorner.\n~\n0 DJK 1\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3860 3803\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3860 3805\nE\nnorthern window~\nLacy white curtains billow slightly from the glass, through which\nyou glimpse a brilliant yellow sun rising over stark black\nmountains.  As you move to try to open the window to see better,\nyou realize it is firmly sealed, and that the 'glass' is perhaps\nnot glass at all, but something beyond your means to shatter.\n~\nS\n#3807\nThe Moonstone Inn's Room Number One~\nThe ceiling of this room is high and vaulted, with the walls\npainted a delicate eggshell and trimmed in white.  A four poster\nbed with white silk sheets and huge fluffy pillows is to your\nleft; ahead of you a claw-footed bathtub is tucked into an\nalcove, a covered ice bucket standing next to it.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3862 3808\nE\nceiling~\nYou estimate it to be about a fifteen foot arch.\n~\nS\n#3808\nThe Moonstone Inn Second Floor Hallway~\nGreen glass globes flicker from the walls, illuminating the dark\nglossy panelling and the smooth slate floor.

As\nyou examine them longer, you notice that the light flitters\nimperceptibly about.\n~\nE\nslate tiles floor~\nThe floor is impeccably clean and tiled in a dull deep gray\nslate.\n~\nE\nstairs spiral~\nThe stairs are completely free from dirt, even if you scuff your\ndirty boots across them.  Their highly gleaming oaken surface is,\nyou suspect, protected by magic -- which imbues in you a suddenly\ngreater respect and touch of fear toward Archangelo.\n~\nS\n#3809\nThe Moonstone Inn's Room Number Two~\nYou step down dark green marble stairs into a sunken living room\narea, noting a luxuriously appointed bed on your right side, and\na matched marble-topped desk to your right side.  Heavy black\nvelvet curtains flank a window which looks down onto the street.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3863 3808\nE\nwindow street~\nYou notice a knight getting his pocket picked.\n~\nE\nheavy black velvet curtains~\nThey are of a deep soft richness that makes you want to stroke\nthem like they were a cat.\n~\nE\ndark green marble stairs~\nThey are veined with black and have recently been buffed to a\nblinding glare.\n~\nS\n#3810\nThe Moonstone Inn's Room Number Three~\nYou step lightly onto a plush royal blue carpet, your feet\nleaving no marks as you enter the room.  The walls are a pale\nblue with white trim, and the couch to your left is is a slightly\ndarker shade of blue velvet.  A small glass-topped coffee table\nstands next to the couch.

Blond wood panelling has been set over\nstone walls, and candles burn at all four corners of the room\nwith adequate brilliance to light the area fully.  An enormous\nsunken bath, perhaps as much as seven feet long and four feet\nwide, occupies all that the carpet does not, and a comfortable\nlooking bed takes up another quarter of the room.\n~\n0 DJK 0\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16391 3866 3814\nE\ncandles~\nThey are of a sweet-smelling beeswax.\n~\nE\nblond wood panelling~\nEach panel is elegantly decorated, some with carving, others with\nblack inlay work.\n~\nE\nthick rug pattern blue red~\nAs you examine it, the pattern seems to resolve into something\nintelligible, but just before you manage to determine what, the\nknowledge slips from you again.\n~\nS\n#3814\nThe Moonstone Inn Second Floor Hallway~\nGreen glass globes flicker from the walls, illuminating the dark\nglossy panelling and the smooth slate floor.

The smoke from the flames spirals up, caught\nby an air current, along a flight of circular stairs that\ndoubtless lead to the private guest rooms.  To the side of the\nmanager's desk is a door marked simply 'Common Room' and to the\neast is an entranceway to a smoky, hazy barroom.\n~\n0 DK 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3802\nD1\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3801\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3808\nE\nornately coatrack~\nThe delicate tendrils that extend out as coathooks seem too\npretty and too fragile to possibly be put to any such mundane use\nas bearing a cloak or a coat.

Above it hang racks of glasses of\nall sizes for all drinks imaginable, and behind it stand bottles\ncontaining the means to formulate such drinks.\n\nAround the room stand about a half dozen small round oak tables,\nall etched with use but kept carefully clean.

Blond wood panelling has been set over\nstone walls, and candles burn at all four corners of the room\nwith adequate brilliance to light the area fully.

In upon this very spot I\nregretfully did trod, and in this place was Guenevere, her soft form\nfinding solice in the strong arms of mine own champion and friend. A\nkilling rage overcame me! I drew the bright sword of Camelot, Excaliber\nfrom my side and drove it, with great violence, through her sleeping\nbreast, with steadfast intention to follow with both Lancelot, and mine\nown self. But upon withdrawing the blade I was consumed with such regret\nthat mine only hope was that wishing upon wish would allow me to recind\nthe most horrible deed and bring the lifeblood back to my lady love.\nI put Excaliber to mine own throat, and offered mine own life that she\nmight live, but Lancelot stayed mine hand, and offered his own in\npenance.

But an\nanswer he did not have.

I\nresolved to find the artifact that Guenevere might taste sweet air once\nmore, and set off, leaving Kay the command of Camelot.

But an\nanswer he did not have.

I\nresolved to find the artifact that Guenevere might taste sweet air once\nmore, and set off, leaving Kay the command of Camelot.

I am sorry you have come. It is true, I have\nslain my lady. It was a cold evening, and upon alert of some foul knight\nmaking advance upon the chambers of Guenevere, I perchance searched the\ngarden for a clue to her whereabouts. In upon this very spot I\nregretfully did trod, and in this place was Guenevere, her soft form\nfinding solice in the strong arms of mine own champion and friend. A\nkilling rage overcame me! I drew the bright sword of Camelot, Excaliber\nfrom my side and drove it, with great violence, through her sleeping\nbreast, with steadfast intention to follow with both Lancelot, and mine\nown self. But upon withdrawing the blade I was consumed with such regret\nthat mine only hope was that wishing upon wish would allow me to recind\nthe most horrible deed and bring the lifeblood back to my lady love.\nI put Excaliber to mine own throat, and offered mine own life that she\nmight live, but Lancelot stayed mine hand, and offered his own in\npenance. But alas, niether sacrafice could undo the deed that we wished\nso profoundly undone. We ran to the tower of Merlin in the hopes that\nhis mysterious magics might somehow hold the secret of life. But an\nanswer he did not have. Frantically we searched the library for any\nclue to action, and finally, Merlin did find a story of the cup of\nChrist, the Holy Grail, that had been known to resurrect the dead. I\nresolved to find the artifact that Guenevere might taste sweet air once\nmore, and set off, leaving Kay the command of Camelot. And we did quest\nfar to the east, and we did find the cup of Christ. Now I care for\nnothing else save administering these sips of water that Guenevere\nmight once again live long enough to accept my apologies, and perhaps\nsome day, should this happen, I may be able to forgive myself.\"\n \n~\nhuman~\n(null)~\n(null)~\n(null)~\nABT DFHNc 1000 0\n60 12 0d0+12000 0d0+500 0d0+36 slice\n-30 -30 -30 -30\nCDEFHKNU ABN DM P\nrest rest male 10000\n0 0 medium 0\nF par GHI\n#2443\nblythe spirit~\nA Blythe spirit~\nA Blythe Spirit is here tending the garden.\n~\nAlthough most would have assumed her to be little more than a common\nyoung girl who kept the weeds from Guenevere's garden, Blyth had a\nmysterious past.

But an\nanswer he did not have.

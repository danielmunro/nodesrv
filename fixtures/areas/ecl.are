It reads:\n     Time has no meaning to me anymore.  In truth, I think time stopped\n  when the Mage came on board, with his cabinet and bags.  I did not\n  question him when he asked for passage, nor did I question him when\n  he asked that the strange cabinet be stored in my cabin.  His\n  gold was good, very plentiful, and more was promised at journeys end.\n  Several days out he came to me, offering me power beyond imagination.\n  Fool was I to listen to his candied words.  He gave to me a belt and\n  sword, supposedly from some ancient king.  When I girded myself with\n  these items, the pain was unbearable, and I passed out.\n     When I came to, the ship was under attack.  I rushed above deck just\n  in time to see the Mage dragged from the ship by a huge tentacle,\n  still flinging his magics at the beast.  We managed to drive the\n  beast away, my new sword cutting through tentacles like butter.  Our\n  efforts were in vain though, the ship damaged beyond repair, and the\n  long boats destroyed. As the sea rushed in and gathered me to it's\n  bosom, I found that I did not need to breath.  My men were affected\n  similarly, some sooner than others as they grew exhausted trying to\n  stay afloat, eventually drawn to the ship by some mysterious force.\n  This was when I thought to look to the items given me by the mage.\n  There mystic symbols now legible to me, I read the inscription and\n  howled in rage. Now my crew and I haunt the ship, unable to leave.\n  Their anger at the fate I had brought to them was tremendous.\n  Eventually they could no longer stand the sight of me and locked me\n  inside my cabin.\n     The cabinet is still a mystery.  All my efforts to unlock it have\n  proved futile.  The key must have been on the Mage when he was dragged\n  from the ship.  I feel it is a mystery I will never solve.\n  There is no escape....\n\n~\nS\n#6436\nPort Side Hallway~\nThis is a hallway skirting the hull wall.

It reads:\n     Time has no meaning to me anymore.  In truth, I think time stopped\n  when the Mage came on board, with his cabinet and bags.  I did not\n  question him when he asked for passage, nor did I question him when\n  he asked that the strange cabinet be stored in my cabin.  His\n  gold was good, very plentiful, and more was promised at journeys end.\n  Several days out he came to me, offering me power beyond imagination.\n  Fool was I to listen to his candied words.  He gave to me a belt and\n  sword, supposedly from some ancient king.  When I girded myself with\n  these items, the pain was unbearable, and I passed out.\n     When I came to, the ship was under attack.  I rushed above deck just\n  in time to see the Mage dragged from the ship by a huge tentacle,\n  still flinging his magics at the beast.  We managed to drive the\n  beast away, my new sword cutting through tentacles like butter.  Our\n  efforts were in vain though, the ship damaged beyond repair, and the\n  long boats destroyed. As the sea rushed in and gathered me to it's\n  bosom, I found that I did not need to breath.  My men were affected\n  similarly, some sooner than others as they grew exhausted trying to\n  stay afloat, eventually drawn to the ship by some mysterious force.\n  This was when I thought to look to the items given me by the mage.\n  There mystic symbols now legible to me, I read the inscription and\n  howled in rage. Now my crew and I haunt the ship, unable to leave.\n  Their anger at the fate I had brought to them was tremendous.\n  Eventually they could no longer stand the sight of me and locked me\n  inside my cabin.\n     The cabinet is still a mystery.  All my efforts to unlock it have\n  proved futile.  The key must have been on the Mage when he was dragged\n  from the ship.  I feel it is a mystery I will never solve.\n  There is no escape....\n\n~\nS\n#6436\nPort Side Hallway~\nThis is a hallway skirting the hull wall.

Apparently some force has kept\nthe water at bay at the door's threshold.  The room is very spacious,\nand most likey the second largest room on ship. A large bed is against\nthe far wall, and a desk occupies the center of the room.  Against the\nport wall is a large cabinet, its doors glowing a bright blue.

It reads:\n     Time has no meaning to me anymore.  In truth, I think time stopped\n  when the Mage came on board, with his cabinet and bags.  I did not\n  question him when he asked for passage, nor did I question him when\n  he asked that the strange cabinet be stored in my cabin.  His\n  gold was good, very plentiful, and more was promised at journeys end.\n  Several days out he came to me, offering me power beyond imagination.\n  Fool was I to listen to his candied words.  He gave to me a belt and\n  sword, supposedly from some ancient king.  When I girded myself with\n  these items, the pain was unbearable, and I passed out.\n     When I came to, the ship was under attack.  I rushed above deck just\n  in time to see the Mage dragged from the ship by a huge tentacle,\n  still flinging his magics at the beast.  We managed to drive the\n  beast away, my new sword cutting through tentacles like butter.  Our\n  efforts were in vain though, the ship damaged beyond repair, and the\n  long boats destroyed. As the sea rushed in and gathered me to it's\n  bosom, I found that I did not need to breath.  My men were affected\n  similarly, some sooner than others as they grew exhausted trying to\n  stay afloat, eventually drawn to the ship by some mysterious force.\n  This was when I thought to look to the items given me by the mage.\n  There mystic symbols now legible to me, I read the inscription and\n  howled in rage. Now my crew and I haunt the ship, unable to leave.\n  Their anger at the fate I had brought to them was tremendous.\n  Eventually they could no longer stand the sight of me and locked me\n  inside my cabin.\n     The cabinet is still a mystery.  All my efforts to unlock it have\n  proved futile.  The key must have been on the Mage when he was dragged\n  from the ship.  I feel it is a mystery I will never solve.\n  There is no escape....\n\n~\nS\n#6436\nPort Side Hallway~\nThis is a hallway skirting the hull wall.

It reads:\n     Time has no meaning to me anymore.  In truth, I think time stopped\n  when the Mage came on board, with his cabinet and bags.  I did not\n  question him when he asked for passage, nor did I question him when\n  he asked that the strange cabinet be stored in my cabin.  His\n  gold was good, very plentiful, and more was promised at journeys end.\n  Several days out he came to me, offering me power beyond imagination.\n  Fool was I to listen to his candied words.  He gave to me a belt and\n  sword, supposedly from some ancient king.  When I girded myself with\n  these items, the pain was unbearable, and I passed out.\n     When I came to, the ship was under attack.  I rushed above deck just\n  in time to see the Mage dragged from the ship by a huge tentacle,\n  still flinging his magics at the beast.  We managed to drive the\n  beast away, my new sword cutting through tentacles like butter.  Our\n  efforts were in vain though, the ship damaged beyond repair, and the\n  long boats destroyed. As the sea rushed in and gathered me to it's\n  bosom, I found that I did not need to breath.  My men were affected\n  similarly, some sooner than others as they grew exhausted trying to\n  stay afloat, eventually drawn to the ship by some mysterious force.\n  This was when I thought to look to the items given me by the mage.\n  There mystic symbols now legible to me, I read the inscription and\n  howled in rage. Now my crew and I haunt the ship, unable to leave.\n  Their anger at the fate I had brought to them was tremendous.\n  Eventually they could no longer stand the sight of me and locked me\n  inside my cabin.\n     The cabinet is still a mystery.  All my efforts to unlock it have\n  proved futile.  The key must have been on the Mage when he was dragged\n  from the ship.  I feel it is a mystery I will never solve.\n  There is no escape....\n\n~\nS\n#6436\nPort Side Hallway~\nThis is a hallway skirting the hull wall.

I did not\n  question him when he asked for passage, nor did I question him when\n  he asked that the strange cabinet be stored in my cabin.  His\n  gold was good, very plentiful, and more was promised at journeys end.\n  Several days out he came to me, offering me power beyond imagination.\n  Fool was I to listen to his candied words.  He gave to me a belt and\n  sword, supposedly from some ancient king.  When I girded myself with\n  these items, the pain was unbearable, and I passed out.\n     When I came to, the ship was under attack.  I rushed above deck just\n  in time to see the Mage dragged from the ship by a huge tentacle,\n  still flinging his magics at the beast.  We managed to drive the\n  beast away, my new sword cutting through tentacles like butter.  Our\n  efforts were in vain though, the ship damaged beyond repair, and the\n  long boats destroyed. As the sea rushed in and gathered me to it's\n  bosom, I found that I did not need to breath.  My men were affected\n  similarly, some sooner than others as they grew exhausted trying to\n  stay afloat, eventually drawn to the ship by some mysterious force.\n  This was when I thought to look to the items given me by the mage.\n  There mystic symbols now legible to me, I read the inscription and\n  howled in rage. Now my crew and I haunt the ship, unable to leave.\n  Their anger at the fate I had brought to them was tremendous.\n  Eventually they could no longer stand the sight of me and locked me\n  inside my cabin.\n     The cabinet is still a mystery.  All my efforts to unlock it have\n  proved futile.  The key must have been on the Mage when he was dragged\n  from the ship.  I feel it is a mystery I will never solve.\n  There is no escape....","stop":"S"},{"id":"6436","title":"Port Side Hallway","description":"This is a hallway skirting the hull wall.

It reads:\n     Time has no meaning to me anymore.  In truth, I think time stopped\n  when the Mage came on board, with his cabinet and bags.  I did not\n  question him when he asked for passage, nor did I question him when\n  he asked that the strange cabinet be stored in my cabin.  His\n  gold was good, very plentiful, and more was promised at journeys end.\n  Several days out he came to me, offering me power beyond imagination.\n  Fool was I to listen to his candied words.  He gave to me a belt and\n  sword, supposedly from some ancient king.  When I girded myself with\n  these items, the pain was unbearable, and I passed out.\n     When I came to, the ship was under attack.  I rushed above deck just\n  in time to see the Mage dragged from the ship by a huge tentacle,\n  still flinging his magics at the beast.  We managed to drive the\n  beast away, my new sword cutting through tentacles like butter.  Our\n  efforts were in vain though, the ship damaged beyond repair, and the\n  long boats destroyed. As the sea rushed in and gathered me to it's\n  bosom, I found that I did not need to breath.  My men were affected\n  similarly, some sooner than others as they grew exhausted trying to\n  stay afloat, eventually drawn to the ship by some mysterious force.\n  This was when I thought to look to the items given me by the mage.\n  There mystic symbols now legible to me, I read the inscription and\n  howled in rage. Now my crew and I haunt the ship, unable to leave.\n  Their anger at the fate I had brought to them was tremendous.\n  Eventually they could no longer stand the sight of me and locked me\n  inside my cabin.\n     The cabinet is still a mystery.  All my efforts to unlock it have\n  proved futile.  The key must have been on the Mage when he was dragged\n  from the ship.  I feel it is a mystery I will never solve.\n  There is no escape....\n\n~\nS\n#6436\nPort Side Hallway~\nThis is a hallway skirting the hull wall.

It reads:\n     Time has no meaning to me anymore.  In truth, I think time stopped\n  when the Mage came on board, with his cabinet and bags.  I did not\n  question him when he asked for passage, nor did I question him when\n  he asked that the strange cabinet be stored in my cabin.  His\n  gold was good, very plentiful, and more was promised at journeys end.\n  Several days out he came to me, offering me power beyond imagination.\n  Fool was I to listen to his candied words.  He gave to me a belt and\n  sword, supposedly from some ancient king.  When I girded myself with\n  these items, the pain was unbearable, and I passed out.\n     When I came to, the ship was under attack.  I rushed above deck just\n  in time to see the Mage dragged from the ship by a huge tentacle,\n  still flinging his magics at the beast.  We managed to drive the\n  beast away, my new sword cutting through tentacles like butter.  Our\n  efforts were in vain though, the ship damaged beyond repair, and the\n  long boats destroyed. As the sea rushed in and gathered me to it's\n  bosom, I found that I did not need to breath.  My men were affected\n  similarly, some sooner than others as they grew exhausted trying to\n  stay afloat, eventually drawn to the ship by some mysterious force.\n  This was when I thought to look to the items given me by the mage.\n  There mystic symbols now legible to me, I read the inscription and\n  howled in rage. Now my crew and I haunt the ship, unable to leave.\n  Their anger at the fate I had brought to them was tremendous.\n  Eventually they could no longer stand the sight of me and locked me\n  inside my cabin.\n     The cabinet is still a mystery.  All my efforts to unlock it have\n  proved futile.  The key must have been on the Mage when he was dragged\n  from the ship.  I feel it is a mystery I will never solve.\n  There is no escape....\n\n~\nS\n#6436\nPort Side Hallway~\nThis is a hallway skirting the hull wall.

I did not\n  question him when he asked for passage, nor did I question him when\n  he asked that the strange cabinet be stored in my cabin.  His\n  gold was good, very plentiful, and more was promised at journeys end.\n  Several days out he came to me, offering me power beyond imagination.\n  Fool was I to listen to his candied words.  He gave to me a belt and\n  sword, supposedly from some ancient king.  When I girded myself with\n  these items, the pain was unbearable, and I passed out.\n     When I came to, the ship was under attack.  I rushed above deck just\n  in time to see the Mage dragged from the ship by a huge tentacle,\n  still flinging his magics at the beast.  We managed to drive the\n  beast away, my new sword cutting through tentacles like butter.  Our\n  efforts were in vain though, the ship damaged beyond repair, and the\n  long boats destroyed. As the sea rushed in and gathered me to it's\n  bosom, I found that I did not need to breath.  My men were affected\n  similarly, some sooner than others as they grew exhausted trying to\n  stay afloat, eventually drawn to the ship by some mysterious force.\n  This was when I thought to look to the items given me by the mage.\n  There mystic symbols now legible to me, I read the inscription and\n  howled in rage. Now my crew and I haunt the ship, unable to leave.\n  Their anger at the fate I had brought to them was tremendous.\n  Eventually they could no longer stand the sight of me and locked me\n  inside my cabin.\n     The cabinet is still a mystery.  All my efforts to unlock it have\n  proved futile.  The key must have been on the Mage when he was dragged\n  from the ship.

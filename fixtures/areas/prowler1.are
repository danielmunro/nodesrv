Sut and filth cover the walls and the\ntables.  A clean spot on one wall is very oddly shaped.  A weapon of some sort\nthat had hung there for years must have recently been sold.  It's shape \nresembles that of an axe blade on one side and a pitchfork on the other.\nThe shaft of the weapon must have been very slim, with some sort of a ball at\nthe end of it.  Perhaps to balance the weapon in ones hands.  It certainly\nwould be an odd weapon to fight with.\n \nMuhtar sits behind a table sharpening his blade.  He doesn't even offer you a\ngreeting.

Some of the tapestries have faded a little,\nand some of the sculptures seem to be covered with a fine layer of \ndust. Against the south wall stands a grandfather clock, which \npresents a sharp contrast to the vaguely Byzantine dcor. The \nfloor is paved in dark slate and several heavily brocaded rugs\nhave been scattered about the room in no discernable pattern. \nThere is an ancient feel here, as if great deeds, both good and \nevil, were accomplished in this room. The walls seem to whisper \nof orgies, coronations, and executions. To the south you see a \nmassive marble staircase with mahogany handrails.

On one \nside of the room is a large stone fireplace.  A flame merrily \ndances in its depths.  The room appears to be spinning thanks to \nthe oil lamps splashing their rainbow patterns all over the walls.  \nReds, Blues, Greens, and Yellows swim and dance in your vision.  \nThe sweet smell of incense hits your nose, and almost sends your \nmind reeling.  A smokey haze permeates the room smelling of exotic \nherbs and spices.  Music fills your ears and you almost feel yourself \nswaying to the hypnotic melody.  A peace youve never know comes over \nyour body.  You hear snatches of deep, philosophical conversations that \nconfound your sense of reality. As you step down into the center of the \nroom, a man rises from his seat and greets you.  Welcome to the \nspeakeasy, he smiles.

The stars shine steadily with almost no twinkle and \nthey cast enough light to see the landscape below. The lonely cry \nof a hunting wolf echoes from the distant forest.

On a small table on the east wall, a brass sculpture of a \nfalcon (obviously a censer) emits a thin stream of smoke. Near the \nsouth wall, a small copper dagger hangs in the air, seemingly of its \nown volition. Blue flames leap from the blade. On the west wall, a \nfountain carved from blocks of red ice bubbles quietly. There is an \nexpectant feel to the room, as if some solemn ceremony had been \ninterrupted and would resume shortly.

A faint odor of sulphur and smoke filters in the air from a recent\nexplosion. Though the room looks in disarray the items seem to be sorted.

In the \ndistance there are trees, hills, wildflowers, and a creek.  This \npellucid space is where ALL the fun is had. Grateful Dead music \nscreams at you right from the walls; St.Stephen had them fitted with \nspeakers from THE Wall Of Sound the Dead used back in 73.  Amazing \nlighting rigs are built into the trees, and completely mesmerize \nguests when watching a band play on the stage.

On one \nside of the room is a large stone fireplace.  A flame merrily \ndances in its depths.  The room appears to be spinning thanks to \nthe oil lamps splashing their rainbow patterns all over the walls.  \nReds, Blues, Greens, and Yellows swim and dance in your vision.  \nThe sweet smell of incense hits your nose, and almost sends your \nmind reeling.  A smokey haze permeates the room smelling of exotic \nherbs and spices.  Music fills your ears and you almost feel yourself \nswaying to the hypnotic melody.  A peace youve never know comes over \nyour body.  You hear snatches of deep, philosophical conversations that \nconfound your sense of reality. As you step down into the center of the \nroom, a man rises from his seat and greets you.  Welcome to the \nspeakeasy, he smiles.

The stars shine steadily with almost no twinkle and \nthey cast enough light to see the landscape below. The lonely cry \nof a hunting wolf echoes from the distant forest.

On a small table on the east wall, a brass sculpture of a \nfalcon (obviously a censer) emits a thin stream of smoke. Near the \nsouth wall, a small copper dagger hangs in the air, seemingly of its \nown volition. Blue flames leap from the blade. On the west wall, a \nfountain carved from blocks of red ice bubbles quietly. There is an \nexpectant feel to the room, as if some solemn ceremony had been \ninterrupted and would resume shortly.

Some of the tapestries have faded a little,\nand some of the sculptures seem to be covered with a fine layer of \ndust. Against the south wall stands a grandfather clock, which \npresents a sharp contrast to the vaguely Byzantine dcor. The \nfloor is paved in dark slate and several heavily brocaded rugs\nhave been scattered about the room in no discernable pattern. \nThere is an ancient feel here, as if great deeds, both good and \nevil, were accomplished in this room. The walls seem to whisper \nof orgies, coronations, and executions. To the south you see a \nmassive marble staircase with mahogany handrails.

On one \nside of the room is a large stone fireplace.  A flame merrily \ndances in its depths.  The room appears to be spinning thanks to \nthe oil lamps splashing their rainbow patterns all over the walls.  \nReds, Blues, Greens, and Yellows swim and dance in your vision.  \nThe sweet smell of incense hits your nose, and almost sends your \nmind reeling.  A smokey haze permeates the room smelling of exotic \nherbs and spices.  Music fills your ears and you almost feel yourself \nswaying to the hypnotic melody.  A peace youve never know comes over \nyour body.  You hear snatches of deep, philosophical conversations that \nconfound your sense of reality. As you step down into the center of the \nroom, a man rises from his seat and greets you.  Welcome to the \nspeakeasy, he smiles.

The stars shine steadily with almost no twinkle and \nthey cast enough light to see the landscape below. The lonely cry \nof a hunting wolf echoes from the distant forest.

On a small table on the east wall, a brass sculpture of a \nfalcon (obviously a censer) emits a thin stream of smoke. Near the \nsouth wall, a small copper dagger hangs in the air, seemingly of its \nown volition. Blue flames leap from the blade. On the west wall, a \nfountain carved from blocks of red ice bubbles quietly. There is an \nexpectant feel to the room, as if some solemn ceremony had been \ninterrupted and would resume shortly.

A faint odor of sulphur and smoke filters in the air from a recent\nexplosion. Though the room looks in disarray the items seem to be sorted.

In the \ndistance there are trees, hills, wildflowers, and a creek.  This \npellucid space is where ALL the fun is had. Grateful Dead music \nscreams at you right from the walls; St.Stephen had them fitted with \nspeakers from THE Wall Of Sound the Dead used back in 73.  Amazing \nlighting rigs are built into the trees, and completely mesmerize \nguests when watching a band play on the stage.

On one \nside of the room is a large stone fireplace.  A flame merrily \ndances in its depths.  The room appears to be spinning thanks to \nthe oil lamps splashing their rainbow patterns all over the walls.  \nReds, Blues, Greens, and Yellows swim and dance in your vision.  \nThe sweet smell of incense hits your nose, and almost sends your \nmind reeling.  A smokey haze permeates the room smelling of exotic \nherbs and spices.  Music fills your ears and you almost feel yourself \nswaying to the hypnotic melody.  A peace youve never know comes over \nyour body.  You hear snatches of deep, philosophical conversations that \nconfound your sense of reality. As you step down into the center of the \nroom, a man rises from his seat and greets you.  Welcome to the \nspeakeasy, he smiles.

The stars shine steadily with almost no twinkle and \nthey cast enough light to see the landscape below. The lonely cry \nof a hunting wolf echoes from the distant forest.

On a small table on the east wall, a brass sculpture of a \nfalcon (obviously a censer) emits a thin stream of smoke. Near the \nsouth wall, a small copper dagger hangs in the air, seemingly of its \nown volition. Blue flames leap from the blade. On the west wall, a \nfountain carved from blocks of red ice bubbles quietly. There is an \nexpectant feel to the room, as if some solemn ceremony had been \ninterrupted and would resume shortly.

On one \nside of the room is a large stone fireplace.  A flame merrily \ndances in its depths.  The room appears to be spinning thanks to \nthe oil lamps splashing their rainbow patterns all over the walls.  \nReds, Blues, Greens, and Yellows swim and dance in your vision.  \nThe sweet smell of incense hits your nose, and almost sends your \nmind reeling.  A smokey haze permeates the room smelling of exotic \nherbs and spices.  Music fills your ears and you almost feel yourself \nswaying to the hypnotic melody.  A peace youve never know comes over \nyour body.  You hear snatches of deep, philosophical conversations that \nconfound your sense of reality. As you step down into the center of the \nroom, a man rises from his seat and greets you.  Welcome to the \nspeakeasy, he smiles.

The stars shine steadily with almost no twinkle and \nthey cast enough light to see the landscape below. The lonely cry \nof a hunting wolf echoes from the distant forest.

On a small table on the east wall, a brass sculpture of a \nfalcon (obviously a censer) emits a thin stream of smoke. Near the \nsouth wall, a small copper dagger hangs in the air, seemingly of its \nown volition. Blue flames leap from the blade. On the west wall, a \nfountain carved from blocks of red ice bubbles quietly. There is an \nexpectant feel to the room, as if some solemn ceremony had been \ninterrupted and would resume shortly.

Against the south wall stands a grandfather clock, which \npresents a sharp contrast to the vaguely Byzantine dcor. The \nfloor is paved in dark slate and several heavily brocaded rugs\nhave been scattered about the room in no discernable pattern. \nThere is an ancient feel here, as if great deeds, both good and \nevil, were accomplished in this room. The walls seem to whisper \nof orgies, coronations, and executions. To the south you see a \nmassive marble staircase with mahogany handrails.

A smokey haze permeates the room smelling of exotic \nherbs and spices.  Music fills your ears and you almost feel yourself \nswaying to the hypnotic melody.  A peace youve never know comes over \nyour body.  You hear snatches of deep, philosophical conversations that \nconfound your sense of reality. As you step down into the center of the \nroom, a man rises from his seat and greets you.  Welcome to the \nspeakeasy, he smiles.

The stars shine steadily with almost no twinkle and \nthey cast enough light to see the landscape below. The lonely cry \nof a hunting wolf echoes from the distant forest.

On a small table on the east wall, a brass sculpture of a \nfalcon (obviously a censer) emits a thin stream of smoke. Near the \nsouth wall, a small copper dagger hangs in the air, seemingly of its \nown volition. Blue flames leap from the blade. On the west wall, a \nfountain carved from blocks of red ice bubbles quietly. There is an \nexpectant feel to the room, as if some solemn ceremony had been \ninterrupted and would resume shortly.

On one \nside of the room is a large stone fireplace.  A flame merrily \ndances in its depths.  The room appears to be spinning thanks to \nthe oil lamps splashing their rainbow patterns all over the walls.  \nReds, Blues, Greens, and Yellows swim and dance in your vision.  \nThe sweet smell of incense hits your nose, and almost sends your \nmind reeling.  A smokey haze permeates the room smelling of exotic \nherbs and spices.  Music fills your ears and you almost feel yourself \nswaying to the hypnotic melody.  A peace youve never know comes over \nyour body.  You hear snatches of deep, philosophical conversations that \nconfound your sense of reality. As you step down into the center of the \nroom, a man rises from his seat and greets you.  Welcome to the \nspeakeasy, he smiles.

The stars shine steadily with almost no twinkle and \nthey cast enough light to see the landscape below. The lonely cry \nof a hunting wolf echoes from the distant forest.

On a small table on the east wall, a brass sculpture of a \nfalcon (obviously a censer) emits a thin stream of smoke. Near the \nsouth wall, a small copper dagger hangs in the air, seemingly of its \nown volition. Blue flames leap from the blade. On the west wall, a \nfountain carved from blocks of red ice bubbles quietly. There is an \nexpectant feel to the room, as if some solemn ceremony had been \ninterrupted and would resume shortly.

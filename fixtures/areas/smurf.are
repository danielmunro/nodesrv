He takes pride in his work.  You could get to know him or just squash\nhim.  If Papa Smurf is not here he is probably at Smurfette's putting the\nmoves on her.  A stone path lies to the north.\n~\n0 0 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 107 113\nS\n#126\nPath to Gargamel's Castle~\nYou are walking along a path to Gargamel's Castle to the North.\nSmurfy Road lies to the south.\n~\n0 0 1\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 127\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 115\nS\n#127\nOutside Gargamel's Castle~\nYou are standing outside Gargamel's Castle.  You can hear him screaming at\nAzreal from inside.  You can also him cursing out those wretched smurfs.\nHis Castle is to the north while Smurfy Road is to the south.\n~\n0 0 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 109 128\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 126\nS\n#128\nGargamel's Castle~\nThis is Gargamel's Castle.

Makes it easier for Papa\nSmurf to sneak over at night.  I hope he uses protection.  I would hate to\nhave little smurfs running around.

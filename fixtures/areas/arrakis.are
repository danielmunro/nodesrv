It is an extraordinary piece of art.  The scene is one of\n simple pleasures.  A shoreline, at night.  Two commoners walk along the\n bank, oblivious to the painters fervour.  A small village is just barely\n visible along the horizon.  Upon closer examination, the dark foreground\n has some docked sailboats, lying dormant.  The most amazing aspect of\n this painting is the colour. The water is painted carefully, and the night\n sky above is nearly beyond description.  The sky is what could be\n described as the colour of love, according to the owner of this painting. \n The colours, so perfectly blended from turquoise to the beautiful and\n menacing navy blue the artist is famous for, seep into your soul and uplift\n you.  The stars littering the sky are each given attention, and are painted\n with a wonderfully exaggerated golden yellow.  Each star has an aura\n about it, making it seem as if it were a galaxy of its own.  All of these\n beautiful stars are reflected on the waters surface, in shimmering rays\n of golden yellow.

There are some rather\n primitive looking rock paintings scattered about, done in natural looking\n reds and blues.  The pictures that really catch your attention are the\n bright and vibrant framed pictures. Obviously the being that inhabits this\n lair must think a great deal of the artist to have brought his works into\n the amazon rainforest to decorate this cavern.  The pictures all have\n some form of the name Vincent Van Gogh on them.  Some of the\n paintings jump out at you, such as The Cafe Terrace, Sunflowers, and\n Night Stars.

It depicts a ceramic vase holding a dozen\n or so sunflowers.  They are not painted simply as flowers, but rather as\n individuals.  The background of the painting is bright yellow, the artists\n favourite colour.  The attention to detail in each sunflower is amazing. \n Each petal of every flower is painted with feeling and love for the\n subject. The hues of beautiful, classy orange, to golden and even lemon\n yellows make this painting brilliant.  The vase which holds these\n beautiful sunflowers has a humble signature about the centre, reading\n Vincent.\n~\nE\nterrace~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.  An open cafe in France is\n depicted, with some patrons sitting at the tables.  A brightly painted\n yellow terrace is above the little cafe, and the attention to the detail and\n colour in the trim and shutters of the building is exquisite.  The artist\n has managed to bring out the feeling in a simple doorframe.  Parts of a\n tree across the textured cobblestone street are painted with great\n passion.  The tall buildings in the background are shown as getting darker\n and darker, though a few of the windows in the building are lit up.  The\n most stunning component in this painting is the sky.  The night sky is\n painted with such passion and lust that it overwhelms you.  The sky has\n many shades of blue throughout it- from the most menacing navy blue to\n an almost happy medium blue.  There are many bright stars in the sky,\n each star enveloped in its own brilliant light.  Overall, this painting is an\n incredibly beautiful piece of work, and you can see why the owner had the\n good sense to bring it to this lair.\n~\nE\ncafe~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.

The rock floor is\n cool to the touch.  The reddish-brown walls are decorated with some\n rather interesting paintings, and there are some classy wrought iron\n torch holders hanging from the wall.  The flames from the torches give\n the room an eery yet seductive glow.  As the flames flicker and dance the\n light in the room wavers.  In the middle of an amazon rainforest, this\n cavern is totally secluded.  It looks as if this is the lair of an ethereal\n being.\n~\n0 DJKP 0\nO Ghanima~\nD3\nExit ~\nlair~\n16451 0 2931\nE\nstars~\nNight Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for\n obvious reasons.  It is an extraordinary piece of art.  The scene is one of\n simple pleasures.  A shoreline, at night.  Two commoners walk along the\n bank, oblivious to the painters fervour.  A small village is just barely\n visible along the horizon.  Upon closer examination, the dark foreground\n has some docked sailboats, lying dormant.  The most amazing aspect of\n this painting is the colour. The water is painted carefully, and the night\n sky above is nearly beyond description.  The sky is what could be\n described as the colour of love, according to the owner of this painting. \n The colours, so perfectly blended from turquoise to the beautiful and\n menacing navy blue the artist is famous for, seep into your soul and uplift\n you.  The stars littering the sky are each given attention, and are painted\n with a wonderfully exaggerated golden yellow.  Each star has an aura\n about it, making it seem as if it were a galaxy of its own.  All of these\n beautiful stars are reflected on the waters surface, in shimmering rays\n of golden yellow.  The painting in its entirety raises your spirits and\n relaxes you. \n~\nE\nnight~\nNight Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for\n obvious reasons.

There are some rather\n primitive looking rock paintings scattered about, done in natural looking\n reds and blues.  The pictures that really catch your attention are the\n bright and vibrant framed pictures. Obviously the being that inhabits this\n lair must think a great deal of the artist to have brought his works into\n the amazon rainforest to decorate this cavern.  The pictures all have\n some form of the name Vincent Van Gogh on them.  Some of the\n paintings jump out at you, such as The Cafe Terrace, Sunflowers, and\n Night Stars.  You can examine all of the art in the cave more closely.\n~\nE\nsymbols~\n@\n \n \n         IIIIIIIII     III       III           \n            IIII      IIIIII    IIIIII                   \n            IIII       III       III\n            IIII      II         II\n            IIII    II         II\n            IIII  II         II\n            IIIIII         II\n            IIII         II\n            IIII       II\n            IIII     II\n            IIII   II\n            IIII II\n  @         IIIII         @\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n         IIIIIIIII\n \n \n              @\n \n \n    <Remembering your lessons in the elven runes, you recall this\n                 particular symbol as meaning \"G\" in elvish runes.>\n \n \n~\nE\nsunflowers~\nThis gorgeous painting, entitled simply Sunflowers is unlike any still\n life you have ever seen before.  It depicts a ceramic vase holding a dozen\n or so sunflowers.  They are not painted simply as flowers, but rather as\n individuals.  The background of the painting is bright yellow, the artists\n favourite colour.  The attention to detail in each sunflower is amazing. \n Each petal of every flower is painted with feeling and love for the\n subject. The hues of beautiful, classy orange, to golden and even lemon\n yellows make this painting brilliant.  The vase which holds these\n beautiful sunflowers has a humble signature about the centre, reading\n Vincent.\n~\nE\nterrace~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.  An open cafe in France is\n depicted, with some patrons sitting at the tables.  A brightly painted\n yellow terrace is above the little cafe, and the attention to the detail and\n colour in the trim and shutters of the building is exquisite.  The artist\n has managed to bring out the feeling in a simple doorframe.  Parts of a\n tree across the textured cobblestone street are painted with great\n passion.  The tall buildings in the background are shown as getting darker\n and darker, though a few of the windows in the building are lit up.  The\n most stunning component in this painting is the sky.  The night sky is\n painted with such passion and lust that it overwhelms you.  The sky has\n many shades of blue throughout it- from the most menacing navy blue to\n an almost happy medium blue.  There are many bright stars in the sky,\n each star enveloped in its own brilliant light.  Overall, this painting is an\n incredibly beautiful piece of work, and you can see why the owner had the\n good sense to bring it to this lair.\n~\nE\ncafe~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.

Outlined in white and\n black, they depict animals in various positions, and people engaged in\n symbolic rituals.  There is also what appears to be be a strange script.

The rock floor is\n cool to the touch.  The reddish-brown walls are decorated with some\n rather interesting paintings, and there are some classy wrought iron\n torch holders hanging from the wall.  The flames from the torches give\n the room an eery yet seductive glow.  As the flames flicker and dance the\n light in the room wavers.  In the middle of an amazon rainforest, this\n cavern is totally secluded.  It looks as if this is the lair of an ethereal\n being.\n~\n0 DJKP 0\nO Ghanima~\nD3\nExit ~\nlair~\n16451 0 2931\nE\nstars~\nNight Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for\n obvious reasons.  It is an extraordinary piece of art.  The scene is one of\n simple pleasures.  A shoreline, at night.  Two commoners walk along the\n bank, oblivious to the painters fervour.  A small village is just barely\n visible along the horizon.  Upon closer examination, the dark foreground\n has some docked sailboats, lying dormant.  The most amazing aspect of\n this painting is the colour. The water is painted carefully, and the night\n sky above is nearly beyond description.  The sky is what could be\n described as the colour of love, according to the owner of this painting. \n The colours, so perfectly blended from turquoise to the beautiful and\n menacing navy blue the artist is famous for, seep into your soul and uplift\n you.  The stars littering the sky are each given attention, and are painted\n with a wonderfully exaggerated golden yellow.  Each star has an aura\n about it, making it seem as if it were a galaxy of its own.  All of these\n beautiful stars are reflected on the waters surface, in shimmering rays\n of golden yellow.  The painting in its entirety raises your spirits and\n relaxes you. \n~\nE\nnight~\nNight Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for\n obvious reasons.

There are some rather\n primitive looking rock paintings scattered about, done in natural looking\n reds and blues.  The pictures that really catch your attention are the\n bright and vibrant framed pictures. Obviously the being that inhabits this\n lair must think a great deal of the artist to have brought his works into\n the amazon rainforest to decorate this cavern.  The pictures all have\n some form of the name Vincent Van Gogh on them.  Some of the\n paintings jump out at you, such as The Cafe Terrace, Sunflowers, and\n Night Stars.  You can examine all of the art in the cave more closely.\n~\nE\nsymbols~\n@\n \n \n         IIIIIIIII     III       III           \n            IIII      IIIIII    IIIIII                   \n            IIII       III       III\n            IIII      II         II\n            IIII    II         II\n            IIII  II         II\n            IIIIII         II\n            IIII         II\n            IIII       II\n            IIII     II\n            IIII   II\n            IIII II\n  @         IIIII         @\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n         IIIIIIIII\n \n \n              @\n \n \n    <Remembering your lessons in the elven runes, you recall this\n                 particular symbol as meaning \"G\" in elvish runes.>\n \n \n~\nE\nsunflowers~\nThis gorgeous painting, entitled simply Sunflowers is unlike any still\n life you have ever seen before.  It depicts a ceramic vase holding a dozen\n or so sunflowers.  They are not painted simply as flowers, but rather as\n individuals.  The background of the painting is bright yellow, the artists\n favourite colour.  The attention to detail in each sunflower is amazing. \n Each petal of every flower is painted with feeling and love for the\n subject. The hues of beautiful, classy orange, to golden and even lemon\n yellows make this painting brilliant.  The vase which holds these\n beautiful sunflowers has a humble signature about the centre, reading\n Vincent.\n~\nE\nterrace~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.  An open cafe in France is\n depicted, with some patrons sitting at the tables.  A brightly painted\n yellow terrace is above the little cafe, and the attention to the detail and\n colour in the trim and shutters of the building is exquisite.  The artist\n has managed to bring out the feeling in a simple doorframe.  Parts of a\n tree across the textured cobblestone street are painted with great\n passion.  The tall buildings in the background are shown as getting darker\n and darker, though a few of the windows in the building are lit up.  The\n most stunning component in this painting is the sky.  The night sky is\n painted with such passion and lust that it overwhelms you.  The sky has\n many shades of blue throughout it- from the most menacing navy blue to\n an almost happy medium blue.  There are many bright stars in the sky,\n each star enveloped in its own brilliant light.  Overall, this painting is an\n incredibly beautiful piece of work, and you can see why the owner had the\n good sense to bring it to this lair.\n~\nE\ncafe~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.

Outlined in white and\n black, they depict animals in various positions, and people engaged in\n symbolic rituals.  There is also what appears to be be a strange script.  A\n large symbol, and some other odd symbols following it.\n~\nS\n#2938\nBeginning of the rainbow~\nRainbow falls on the green spot in the middle of the valley\nwhere only one flower is able to grow.

A small village is just barely\n visible along the horizon.  Upon closer examination, the dark foreground\n has some docked sailboats, lying dormant.  The most amazing aspect of\n this painting is the colour. The water is painted carefully, and the night\n sky above is nearly beyond description.  The sky is what could be\n described as the colour of love, according to the owner of this painting. \n The colours, so perfectly blended from turquoise to the beautiful and\n menacing navy blue the artist is famous for, seep into your soul and uplift\n you.  The stars littering the sky are each given attention, and are painted\n with a wonderfully exaggerated golden yellow.  Each star has an aura\n about it, making it seem as if it were a galaxy of its own.  All of these\n beautiful stars are reflected on the waters surface, in shimmering rays\n of golden yellow.

The background of the painting is bright yellow, the artists\n favourite colour.  The attention to detail in each sunflower is amazing. \n Each petal of every flower is painted with feeling and love for the\n subject. The hues of beautiful, classy orange, to golden and even lemon\n yellows make this painting brilliant.  The vase which holds these\n beautiful sunflowers has a humble signature about the centre, reading\n Vincent.\n~\nE\nterrace~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.  An open cafe in France is\n depicted, with some patrons sitting at the tables.  A brightly painted\n yellow terrace is above the little cafe, and the attention to the detail and\n colour in the trim and shutters of the building is exquisite.  The artist\n has managed to bring out the feeling in a simple doorframe.  Parts of a\n tree across the textured cobblestone street are painted with great\n passion.  The tall buildings in the background are shown as getting darker\n and darker, though a few of the windows in the building are lit up.  The\n most stunning component in this painting is the sky.  The night sky is\n painted with such passion and lust that it overwhelms you.  The sky has\n many shades of blue throughout it- from the most menacing navy blue to\n an almost happy medium blue.  There are many bright stars in the sky,\n each star enveloped in its own brilliant light.  Overall, this painting is an\n incredibly beautiful piece of work, and you can see why the owner had the\n good sense to bring it to this lair.\n~\nE\ncafe~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.

The background of the painting is bright yellow, the artists\n favourite colour.  The attention to detail in each sunflower is amazing. \n Each petal of every flower is painted with feeling and love for the\n subject. The hues of beautiful, classy orange, to golden and even lemon\n yellows make this painting brilliant.  The vase which holds these\n beautiful sunflowers has a humble signature about the centre, reading\n Vincent.","The Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.  An open cafe in France is\n depicted, with some patrons sitting at the tables.  A brightly painted\n yellow terrace is above the little cafe, and the attention to the detail and\n colour in the trim and shutters of the building is exquisite.  The artist\n has managed to bring out the feeling in a simple doorframe.  Parts of a\n tree across the textured cobblestone street are painted with great\n passion.  The tall buildings in the background are shown as getting darker\n and darker, though a few of the windows in the building are lit up.  The\n most stunning component in this painting is the sky.  The night sky is\n painted with such passion and lust that it overwhelms you.  The sky has\n many shades of blue throughout it- from the most menacing navy blue to\n an almost happy medium blue.  There are many bright stars in the sky,\n each star enveloped in its own brilliant light.

Looking up, you see an unforgettable\n scene.  The pure water of the river pouring down the rocks is framed by\n the blossoms and leaves above, while the sun again peeks through the\n leaves.  The sky is an incredible shade of azure blue, and adds to the\n stunning panorama that has unfolded before you.  \n~\n0 0 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 2933\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 2930\nS\n#2933\nThe Relaxing River~\nThe waterfall ends here, flowing mellifluously down the stream.  Craggy\n rocks protrude from the river.  You glimpse some silver flashes jumping\n from the water, fighting the strong current that the waterfall has\n created.  The plant life seems to thicken here, making it a bit more\n difficult to navigate along the side of the river.  Perhaps it would be a\n better idea to jump in and cool off!\n~\n0 0 6\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 2932\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 2934\nS\n#2934\nCool Water~\nThe cool water envelops you, and carefully carries you down the stream. \n Ahh, what relaxation after a hard day of travelling through this jungle. \n Mmmm...\n~\n0 0 6\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 2933\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 2935\nS\n#2935\nWarm Water~\nThe water gets warmer, as you are being carried along by the now gentle\n current of the river.

The rock floor is\n cool to the touch.  The reddish-brown walls are decorated with some\n rather interesting paintings, and there are some classy wrought iron\n torch holders hanging from the wall.  The flames from the torches give\n the room an eery yet seductive glow.  As the flames flicker and dance the\n light in the room wavers.  In the middle of an amazon rainforest, this\n cavern is totally secluded.  It looks as if this is the lair of an ethereal\n being.\n~\n0 DJKP 0\nO Ghanima~\nD3\nExit ~\nlair~\n16451 0 2931\nE\nstars~\nNight Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for\n obvious reasons.  It is an extraordinary piece of art.  The scene is one of\n simple pleasures.  A shoreline, at night.  Two commoners walk along the\n bank, oblivious to the painters fervour.  A small village is just barely\n visible along the horizon.  Upon closer examination, the dark foreground\n has some docked sailboats, lying dormant.  The most amazing aspect of\n this painting is the colour. The water is painted carefully, and the night\n sky above is nearly beyond description.  The sky is what could be\n described as the colour of love, according to the owner of this painting. \n The colours, so perfectly blended from turquoise to the beautiful and\n menacing navy blue the artist is famous for, seep into your soul and uplift\n you.  The stars littering the sky are each given attention, and are painted\n with a wonderfully exaggerated golden yellow.  Each star has an aura\n about it, making it seem as if it were a galaxy of its own.  All of these\n beautiful stars are reflected on the waters surface, in shimmering rays\n of golden yellow.  The painting in its entirety raises your spirits and\n relaxes you. \n~\nE\nnight~\nNight Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for\n obvious reasons.

There are some rather\n primitive looking rock paintings scattered about, done in natural looking\n reds and blues.  The pictures that really catch your attention are the\n bright and vibrant framed pictures. Obviously the being that inhabits this\n lair must think a great deal of the artist to have brought his works into\n the amazon rainforest to decorate this cavern.  The pictures all have\n some form of the name Vincent Van Gogh on them.  Some of the\n paintings jump out at you, such as The Cafe Terrace, Sunflowers, and\n Night Stars.  You can examine all of the art in the cave more closely.\n~\nE\nsymbols~\n@\n \n \n         IIIIIIIII     III       III           \n            IIII      IIIIII    IIIIII                   \n            IIII       III       III\n            IIII      II         II\n            IIII    II         II\n            IIII  II         II\n            IIIIII         II\n            IIII         II\n            IIII       II\n            IIII     II\n            IIII   II\n            IIII II\n  @         IIIII         @\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n         IIIIIIIII\n \n \n              @\n \n \n    <Remembering your lessons in the elven runes, you recall this\n                 particular symbol as meaning \"G\" in elvish runes.>\n \n \n~\nE\nsunflowers~\nThis gorgeous painting, entitled simply Sunflowers is unlike any still\n life you have ever seen before.  It depicts a ceramic vase holding a dozen\n or so sunflowers.  They are not painted simply as flowers, but rather as\n individuals.  The background of the painting is bright yellow, the artists\n favourite colour.  The attention to detail in each sunflower is amazing. \n Each petal of every flower is painted with feeling and love for the\n subject. The hues of beautiful, classy orange, to golden and even lemon\n yellows make this painting brilliant.  The vase which holds these\n beautiful sunflowers has a humble signature about the centre, reading\n Vincent.\n~\nE\nterrace~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.  An open cafe in France is\n depicted, with some patrons sitting at the tables.  A brightly painted\n yellow terrace is above the little cafe, and the attention to the detail and\n colour in the trim and shutters of the building is exquisite.  The artist\n has managed to bring out the feeling in a simple doorframe.  Parts of a\n tree across the textured cobblestone street are painted with great\n passion.  The tall buildings in the background are shown as getting darker\n and darker, though a few of the windows in the building are lit up.  The\n most stunning component in this painting is the sky.  The night sky is\n painted with such passion and lust that it overwhelms you.  The sky has\n many shades of blue throughout it- from the most menacing navy blue to\n an almost happy medium blue.  There are many bright stars in the sky,\n each star enveloped in its own brilliant light.  Overall, this painting is an\n incredibly beautiful piece of work, and you can see why the owner had the\n good sense to bring it to this lair.\n~\nE\ncafe~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.

Outlined in white and\n black, they depict animals in various positions, and people engaged in\n symbolic rituals.  There is also what appears to be be a strange script.

The rock floor is\n cool to the touch.  The reddish-brown walls are decorated with some\n rather interesting paintings, and there are some classy wrought iron\n torch holders hanging from the wall.  The flames from the torches give\n the room an eery yet seductive glow.  As the flames flicker and dance the\n light in the room wavers.  In the middle of an amazon rainforest, this\n cavern is totally secluded.  It looks as if this is the lair of an ethereal\n being.\n~\n0 DJKP 0\nO Ghanima~\nD3\nExit ~\nlair~\n16451 0 2931\nE\nstars~\nNight Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for\n obvious reasons.  It is an extraordinary piece of art.  The scene is one of\n simple pleasures.  A shoreline, at night.  Two commoners walk along the\n bank, oblivious to the painters fervour.  A small village is just barely\n visible along the horizon.  Upon closer examination, the dark foreground\n has some docked sailboats, lying dormant.  The most amazing aspect of\n this painting is the colour. The water is painted carefully, and the night\n sky above is nearly beyond description.  The sky is what could be\n described as the colour of love, according to the owner of this painting. \n The colours, so perfectly blended from turquoise to the beautiful and\n menacing navy blue the artist is famous for, seep into your soul and uplift\n you.  The stars littering the sky are each given attention, and are painted\n with a wonderfully exaggerated golden yellow.  Each star has an aura\n about it, making it seem as if it were a galaxy of its own.  All of these\n beautiful stars are reflected on the waters surface, in shimmering rays\n of golden yellow.  The painting in its entirety raises your spirits and\n relaxes you. \n~\nE\nnight~\nNight Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for\n obvious reasons.

There are some rather\n primitive looking rock paintings scattered about, done in natural looking\n reds and blues.  The pictures that really catch your attention are the\n bright and vibrant framed pictures. Obviously the being that inhabits this\n lair must think a great deal of the artist to have brought his works into\n the amazon rainforest to decorate this cavern.  The pictures all have\n some form of the name Vincent Van Gogh on them.  Some of the\n paintings jump out at you, such as The Cafe Terrace, Sunflowers, and\n Night Stars.  You can examine all of the art in the cave more closely.\n~\nE\nsymbols~\n@\n \n \n         IIIIIIIII     III       III           \n            IIII      IIIIII    IIIIII                   \n            IIII       III       III\n            IIII      II         II\n            IIII    II         II\n            IIII  II         II\n            IIIIII         II\n            IIII         II\n            IIII       II\n            IIII     II\n            IIII   II\n            IIII II\n  @         IIIII         @\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n            IIII\n         IIIIIIIII\n \n \n              @\n \n \n    <Remembering your lessons in the elven runes, you recall this\n                 particular symbol as meaning \"G\" in elvish runes.>\n \n \n~\nE\nsunflowers~\nThis gorgeous painting, entitled simply Sunflowers is unlike any still\n life you have ever seen before.  It depicts a ceramic vase holding a dozen\n or so sunflowers.  They are not painted simply as flowers, but rather as\n individuals.  The background of the painting is bright yellow, the artists\n favourite colour.  The attention to detail in each sunflower is amazing. \n Each petal of every flower is painted with feeling and love for the\n subject. The hues of beautiful, classy orange, to golden and even lemon\n yellows make this painting brilliant.  The vase which holds these\n beautiful sunflowers has a humble signature about the centre, reading\n Vincent.\n~\nE\nterrace~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.  An open cafe in France is\n depicted, with some patrons sitting at the tables.  A brightly painted\n yellow terrace is above the little cafe, and the attention to the detail and\n colour in the trim and shutters of the building is exquisite.  The artist\n has managed to bring out the feeling in a simple doorframe.  Parts of a\n tree across the textured cobblestone street are painted with great\n passion.  The tall buildings in the background are shown as getting darker\n and darker, though a few of the windows in the building are lit up.  The\n most stunning component in this painting is the sky.  The night sky is\n painted with such passion and lust that it overwhelms you.  The sky has\n many shades of blue throughout it- from the most menacing navy blue to\n an almost happy medium blue.  There are many bright stars in the sky,\n each star enveloped in its own brilliant light.  Overall, this painting is an\n incredibly beautiful piece of work, and you can see why the owner had the\n good sense to bring it to this lair.\n~\nE\ncafe~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.

Outlined in white and\n black, they depict animals in various positions, and people engaged in\n symbolic rituals.  There is also what appears to be be a strange script.

Holding out your hand, you let the water run over it. \n The water is crystal clear, cool, and refreshing.  The sun is shaded by\n some palm leaves far above, but peeks through occasionally as the wind\n gently moves them.  The waterfall goes down farther from here, and the\n ground seems as if it is miles away.  The footing is treacherous, but what\n awaits at the bottom of this natural and ancient wonder looks to be well\n worth the descent.

The plant life seems to thicken here, making it a bit more\n difficult to navigate along the side of the river.

The flames from the torches give\n the room an eery yet seductive glow.  As the flames flicker and dance the\n light in the room wavers.

It is an extraordinary piece of art.  The scene is one of\n simple pleasures.  A shoreline, at night.  Two commoners walk along the\n bank, oblivious to the painters fervour.  A small village is just barely\n visible along the horizon.  Upon closer examination, the dark foreground\n has some docked sailboats, lying dormant.  The most amazing aspect of\n this painting is the colour. The water is painted carefully, and the night\n sky above is nearly beyond description.  The sky is what could be\n described as the colour of love, according to the owner of this painting. \n The colours, so perfectly blended from turquoise to the beautiful and\n menacing navy blue the artist is famous for, seep into your soul and uplift\n you.  The stars littering the sky are each given attention, and are painted\n with a wonderfully exaggerated golden yellow.  Each star has an aura\n about it, making it seem as if it were a galaxy of its own.  All of these\n beautiful stars are reflected on the waters surface, in shimmering rays\n of golden yellow.  The painting in its entirety raises your spirits and\n relaxes you. \n~\nE\nnight~\nNight Stars has been given the most prominent place in this lair, for\n obvious reasons.

There are some rather\n primitive looking rock paintings scattered about, done in natural looking\n reds and blues.  The pictures that really catch your attention are the\n bright and vibrant framed pictures. Obviously the being that inhabits this\n lair must think a great deal of the artist to have brought his works into\n the amazon rainforest to decorate this cavern.  The pictures all have\n some form of the name Vincent Van Gogh on them.  Some of the\n paintings jump out at you, such as The Cafe Terrace, Sunflowers, and\n Night Stars.

It depicts a ceramic vase holding a dozen\n or so sunflowers.  They are not painted simply as flowers, but rather as\n individuals.  The background of the painting is bright yellow, the artists\n favourite colour.  The attention to detail in each sunflower is amazing. \n Each petal of every flower is painted with feeling and love for the\n subject. The hues of beautiful, classy orange, to golden and even lemon\n yellows make this painting brilliant.  The vase which holds these\n beautiful sunflowers has a humble signature about the centre, reading\n Vincent.\n~\nE\nterrace~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.  An open cafe in France is\n depicted, with some patrons sitting at the tables.  A brightly painted\n yellow terrace is above the little cafe, and the attention to the detail and\n colour in the trim and shutters of the building is exquisite.  The artist\n has managed to bring out the feeling in a simple doorframe.  Parts of a\n tree across the textured cobblestone street are painted with great\n passion.  The tall buildings in the background are shown as getting darker\n and darker, though a few of the windows in the building are lit up.  The\n most stunning component in this painting is the sky.  The night sky is\n painted with such passion and lust that it overwhelms you.  The sky has\n many shades of blue throughout it- from the most menacing navy blue to\n an almost happy medium blue.  There are many bright stars in the sky,\n each star enveloped in its own brilliant light.  Overall, this painting is an\n incredibly beautiful piece of work, and you can see why the owner had the\n good sense to bring it to this lair.\n~\nE\ncafe~\nThe Cafe Terrace is a fantastic piece of art.

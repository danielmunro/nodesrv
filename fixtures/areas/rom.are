You must have all the required \"parts\"\nin your inventory for the assemble command to work sucessfully.\nAnyone can use the assemble command, and there is no skill required.\n\n~\n0 HD~\nSyntax: hd\n\nThe hd (hit/damage) command is used to give you a rough idea of\nhow well your character hits and how much base damage your\ncharacter does.\n\n~\n\n0 CHARTER CHARTERS~\n\n    Each of the organized clans have charters that dictate their\nactions during PK.  Loners and Outcasts, not being organized clans,\ndictate their own actions as they see fit.\n\n    The charters are there to define your clan, and to set rules for\nmembers of your clan to follow.  Leaders and recruiters are expected\nto know these rules, and explain them in detail to new recruits.\n\n    Charters are to be followed to the letter.\n~\n\n\n0 ABOLISH~\nUsage:  abolish <player>\n\n    Abolish is a Paladin-only skill that allows them to cure\ndiseases with a touch, by a direct act of divine intervention.\nHowever, a Paladin's god will not grant this power frequently,\nand there is a period of time the Paladin must wait before being\ngranted the power to Abolish again.  This delay grows shorter as\nthe Paladin ages and gains experience.\n\n~\n\n0 'CONE OF SILENCE'~\nUsage:  cast 'cone of silence' <target>\n\nThis spell, if it lands, will envelope the vicitm in a cone of \nsilence.  They will be unable to cast, chant, or use any of\nthe communication channels.\n\nThis spell requires a component.  The component can be found\non a certian dominatrix in the City of Thives.  If the casting\nof this spell fails, there is also a chance that it will fire back\non the caster, causing them to be wrapped in the cone.\n\n~\n0 BOUNTY~\nUsage:   bounty <victim> <amount>\n         bounty show\n\n    Bounties may be set by any clanner on any other clanner, even a \nplayer in your own clan.

You may place multiple bounties on the same person.  \nTo see who is logged on that has a bounty, type 'bounty show'.  The\nbounty will be automatically deposited into your 'gold' count once \nyou kill the victim.  There are some specific rules on bounties, see\n'help rules' for details.  Ignorance of these rules is no excuse to\nbreak them or the spirit of them.\n\n~\n\n0 'MEDIUM'~\n\n   The medium is a very simple kit.  The Medium is throughly connected\nto the physical world, and is able to enhance the regen of anybody in\nthe same room.  All hit point, mana, and move gains are increased by\na ratio to the medium's level for others in the same room.  This is not\na skill, simply an inate ability of the medium.  The medium has no other\nskills or abilities.  The medium does, of course, increase his/her own\nregen as well, and at all times.\n~\n\n0 'WITCH'~\n\nWarlocks and Witches are two parallel kits.  They have the same skills\nand requirements.  One is for males and the other for females.  These\ntwo kits are for mages and wizards, and are combination offense-\nenhancement kits.  They receive five spells.\n\n immolate  :: A fire damage spell comprable to acid blast\n lacerate  :: The most damaging non-breath weapon spell in the game\n clarity   :: Enhances mana regeneraation\n\n arcantic alacrity :: Speeds up spell casting, even for offensive spells.\n arcantic lethargy :: Slows down spell casting for your enemies.\n\n Note that arcantic alacrity's affect will stack with spellcraft, \n making Warlocks and Witches the fastest spell casters in the \n realm.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF THORNS'~\nThis spell, available to Druids and Elementalists, causes attackers to\ntake a small amount of damage when attacking you.  The spell has a \nlong casting delay and large mana cost, and a comparatively short\nduration.  It may be cast on anybody.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF BRAMBLES'~\nThis spell, available to Druids and Elementalists, causes attackers to\ntake a moderate amount of damage when they land attacks on you.  It\ndoes slightly more damage than 'shield of thorns', and also has a high\nmana cost, long delay, and brief duration.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF SPIKES'~\nSister spell to 'shield of thorns' and 'shield of brambles', this spell\nhas a long casting time, high mana cost, and short duration.  It does,\nhowever, do a significant amount of damage to attackers who land their\nhits on you.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF BLADES'~\nThe last spell in the damage shield line, shield of blades is available\nonly to Druids and Elementalists, and does a severe amount of damage \nto the source of a melee attack that hits the caster.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF BEAR'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, boosts the target's\nStrength.  It can be cast on anybody, even while in combat.  It also\nboosts the target's damage output by a set ratio.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF CAT'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, boosts the target's\nDexterity.  It can be cast on anybody, even while in combat.  It also\nboosts the target's chance of landing second, third, and off-hand \nattacks.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF BOAR'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, boosts the target's\nConstitution.  It can be cast on anybody, even while in combat.  It also\nboosts the target's damage resistance.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF OWL'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, boosts the target's\nWisdom.  It can be cast on anybody, even while in combat.  It also\nboosts the target's experience gains while levelling.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF WOLF'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, gives the target\na few extra attacks during melee.  If the target backstabs or kcharges\nwhile affected by Spirit of Wolf, they'll get a third attack, but the\nspell will fade immediately.  Otherwise, the spell gives a set number\nof extra attacks before fading.\n~\n\n\n0 'SPIRIT CALLER' 'SPIRITCALLER'~\n\nSpirit Callers are druids who are intensely in tune with the spirit\nworld around them.  As such, they have access to five spells relating\nto this ability.\n\n  Spirit of Boar, gives a constitution boost.\n  Spirit of Bear, gives a strength boost.\n  Spirit of Cat,  gives a dexterity boost.\n  Spirit of Owl,  gives a wisdom boost.\n  Spirit of Wolf, gives a combat boost.\n\n  All of the spirit spells cost some skill points, and very little \nmana.  They are also all cast very rapidly.\n\nThe spiritcaller kit is available to all races, all genders, but\nonly if they are druids.\n~\n\n0 'FENCE'~\nFences are the consumate sellers of goods.  They are real smooth \noperators, classy, mobster type slick guys.  They use the \nconnive skill in their trade.  Fences also know about the secret\nback rooms that most shopkeepers have.  This allows fences to\ntrade while invis or hidden.\nThis being said, the social stat is very important to them.\n\nSee also:  connive\n~\n0 'CONNIVE'~\nConnive is the skill used by a fence when selling goods.  It\nalso allows the fence to talk their way out of \"sticky\" \nsituations every now and then.\n\nSee also:  fence\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD BASH'~\nSyntax: shieldbash <Victim>\n\nAvailable to Warriors, Blademasters, Samurai, Paladins, Berzerkers.\n\nShield bash stuns your victim for 1 round, and makes spellcasting\nmore difficult for a brief period afterwards.\n~\n\n0 'SYMBOL'~\n\nThere are four Symbol spells.  They are available to clerics and\ncrusaders only.  Their whereabouts and purpose are unknown.\n\n~\n\n0 'HAMSTRING'~\nSyntax: hamstring <victim>\n\n  Hamstring is a specialized opening move for Rogues, Thieves, and\nAssassins.  Hamstring does not require any special weaponry, and it\ncan in fact be performed using only one's bare hands.  When successful,\nhamstring costs the victim moves, some DEXTERITY, and applies the slow\nflag.  Hamstring will also strip haste if it's there.  A hamstrung\nvictim will occassionally have trouble when moving from room to room.\nHaving high strength and constitution not only reduces this problem,\nbut helps to avoid getting hamstrung in the first place.  Hamstring's\nimpressive array of debilitative affects are countered by its short\nduration and the fact that it cannot be used in combat, meaning the\nthief must give up on an opening backstab to use this manuever.\n\n~\n\n0 'ACCLIMATE'~\nSyntax: c 'acclimate' <target>\n\n   Acclimate attunes the recipient to the ambient energy of his or her\nsurroundings, making him/her regenerate incredibly rapidly.  If the\nrecipient of this spell does *ANYTHING* or takes damage from almost\nany source, the spell will cancel.  The recipient must remain absolutely\nstill to receive the full affect.  Druids only may cast this spell.\nThe spell can only be acquired via spell pages.\n\nThe location of this spell page is unknown.\n~\n\n0 'RESEARCH'~\n\n   Research is the skill that mages uses to create new spell scrolls.\nThe higher the skill, the more likely the mage is to successfully\ncraft spell pages.  Research is given automatically to all Mages\nand Wizards.\n\n   Currently most spell research must be done at the public magelab\nin Midgaard, which has recently purchased a MageLab 2000 research kit.\n~\n\n0 'REGENERATION'~\nSyntax: cast 'regeneration' <target>\n\n    This is a restoration-over-time spell.  It lasts for about 4\nminutes and heals a small amount of hit points during that time.\nIt is available to clerics, crusaders, and any hybrids that could\nbe old class cleric.  This spell belongs to no group and must be\nfound on spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'CRITICAL HIT'~\n\n    Critical strikes are a feature that is only available to classes\nthat can be old class warriors.  These are Warrior, Blademaster, Samurai\nBerserker, and Paladin.  If you are one of these classes and you are\noldclass Warrior, you will automatically receive critical strikes.  They\ndo extra damage based on your level.\n\n   If you are not an oldclass warrior but are one of these classes, you\ncan buy the ability to have critical hits by taking the 'enhanced \ncritical' skill.  This will give you critical hitting ability akin to\na warrior's inate ability.  For warriors, this will improve your chance\nof landing a critical hit.  For all characters with 'critical strike'\nthe damage curve is softened slightly.\n\n  Two other specialized crits are available.  'Bludgeoning' works with\nbash weapons, and 'Cleave' works with slashing weapons.  Both give an\nadditional chance to land a critical strike.\n\n  Note that you don't have to take enhanced critical to use cleave or\nbludgeoning.  \n\n Example:\tCleric Paladin\n\tHas no natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit', he\nhas basic crit ability with a soft curve.  If he takes 'cleave', he\nhas better crit chance with slashing weapons, and regular crit chance\nwith all others, and a softer curve.\n\n Example:\tBlademaster\n\tHas natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit' he has\nbetter chance to land a crit plus a softer curve.  If he takes 'cleave',\nhe gets a REALLY good chance to crit with slashers, improved chance to\ncrit with everything else, and soft damage curve.\n~\n\n0 'ENHANCED CRITICAL' 'CLEAVE' 'BLUDGEON'~\nSee 'CRITICAL HIT'.\n~\n\n0 'SUNBURST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sunburst' <target>\n\n    Sunburst is a single-target offensive spell.  It deals LIGHT damage,\nnot fire, and as such it has the potential to blind the victim from the\nintense light.  Sunburst does slightly less damage than the spell 'acid\nblast,' which is part of the basic training of most Boingan mages.\n\n   The origins of the Sunburst spell are unknown.  Researchers have\ndetermined that it is probably usable by Wizards, Mages, and Druids.\n~\n\n0 'SONIC BLAST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sonic blast' <target>\n\n    Sonic Blast emits a wall of mechanic waves that slam into a target in\na concentrated force, snapping bones and causing pain.  Sonic blast does\nslightly less damage than the standard Boingan spell 'acid blast'.   It\nhas the potential to stun the victim for 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of\ncombat.\n\n    Nobody knows where this spell comes from.  A leading researching at\nthe New Thalos academy of magic has suggested that a renegade mage may\nhave escaped into Altirin and developed the spell there.\n~\n\n0 'ADAMANTITE SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'adamantite skin'\n \n    Available to Mages and Wizards only, 'adamantite skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as adamantite.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.  The pages must be researched at the public mage\nlab.  The formula for the adamantite page can be found at the same \nlocation as one of the ingredients.\n~\n\n0 'INCINERATE'~\nSyntax: cast 'incinerate' <victim>\n\n    Incinerate is identicle to the 'acid blast' spell, except it does\nfire-based damage.  Incinerate is available to mages and wizards only.\nIt must be researched at the mage's guild in Midgaard.  The formula\nto create the spell scroll can be found at the magelab.\n~\n\n0 'STEEL SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'steel skin'\n\n\tAvailable to Mages and Wizards only, 'steel skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as steel.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'DIAMOND SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'diamond skin'\n\n\tDiamond skin is available to Mages and Wizards only.  It\ntransforms the flesh of the caster to a diamond-like substance\ncapable of repelling all damage.  Each attack lowers the duration of\nthe affect until eventually it fades completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF FAITH'~\nSyntax: cast 'shield of faith'\n\n   This self-only spell is available to Clerics, Crusaders, Paladins,\nDruids, and Monks.  A shimmering shield of protection is draped over\nthe shoulders of the caster by his/her deity.  The shield will absorb\nthe next several attempts to injure the caster.  The number of attacks\nit absorbs depends on the casting level of the caster.\n\n    This spell belongs to no spell group.  It may only be learned via\nspell pages and the Ritual.\n~\n\n0 RITUAL~\nSyntax: ritual\n \n   The Ritual is a rite by which religious classes learn new spells.\n To perform the ritual, the caster must be holding a spell page that\n has a copy of the spell he wants to learn, and be in an Altar room.\n The better the Altar, the better the chance of the Ritual being \n successful.  Four main factors influence the success of the Ritual.\n A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Level help the caster perform\n the Ritual properly.  But the inherent complexity of the scroll makes\n it more difficult.  \n\n If the Ritual is successful, the caster will receive the spell in his\n 'practice' and 'spells' list, and it functions like a normal spell\n after that.  The scroll is no longer needed, and the caster will never\n lose the spell.  It can be practiced and used like any other spell.\n It does not belong to any spell group.\n\n The caster must meet a level requirement for using the scroll, which\n is generally far lower than the actual level of the spell.  Whether\n or not the Ritual works, the scroll will lose 1 use.  Most scrolls have\n only 1 use, but some lesser scrolls may have more.\n\n The Ritual only works for oldclass clerics.  Oldclass mages will have\n to use study command.\n~\n\n0 STUDY~\nSyntax:  study <scroll name>\n\nThis command only works if your oldclass is mage.  It does one thing:  \ncopy a spellpage.\n\nIf the study attempt  is successful, the caster will receive the spell \nin their 'practice' and 'spells' list.  Once you have enscribed it, the\nthe spellpage is no longer needed.  The learned spell can be practiced\nand used like any other spell.  It does not belong to any spell group.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, 'spell pages'\n\n~\n0 'SPELL PAGES'~\nSpell pages are special scrolls that are found throughout the land of\nBoinga.  They enable an oldclass mage or cleric to learn a new scroll\nwithout having to gain the scroll from a Guildmaster.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, study\n\n~\n0 'REMOVE DISEASE'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove disease' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It \nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Disease is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks disease-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on plague or other non-DOT disease spells.  Remove Disease will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Disease gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 'REMOVE POISON'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove poison' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It\nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Poison is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks poison-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on 'poison' or other non-DOT poison spells.  Remove Poison will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Poison gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 SURNAME~\nSyntax:\tsurname <name>\n\n  Characters who have reached level 35 may select a surname.  This name\n  must conform to the same rules as first names.  You may have the same\n  surname as another character if you wish.  Nobody owns a surname, and\n  nobody has to have your permission to use yours.  Surnames can only be\n  changed by an IMMORTAL once set.  This is not normally done unless your\n  surname is inappropriate, or your character gets married and wishes to\n  take the surname of his or her spouse.  Surnames are only displayed in\n  your score and the who list,  and serve no purpose but for roleplaying \n  and fun.\n\n  You can toggle whether or not you see surnames in the who list by \n  using \"brief surname.\"\n\n~\n\n0 PREFRESH PFRESH~\n\nQ: What exactly is this prefresh I keep hearing about?\n\nA: Over the course of the almost 6 years MHS has been around, characters\n   have levelled under many different systems of gains.  In an effort to\n   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters\n   to \"refresh\" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that\n   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will\n   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years\n   and put everyone on a level playing field.\n\nQ: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?\n\nA: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you \n   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken\n   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all\n   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish\n   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation\n   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you\n   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.\n   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,\n   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.\n   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if\n   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal\n   creation.\n\nQ: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What\n   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after\n   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?\n\nA: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are\n   being discussed include giving out \"xp vouchers\" for the left over xp,\n   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally\n   decided, the answer will be posted here.\n\nQ: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?\n\nA: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through\n   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this\n   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc\n   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using\n   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can\n   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so \n   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.\n\nQ: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,\n   what good are they?\n\nA: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to \n   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you\n   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will\n   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices\n   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.\n\nQ: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.\n\nA: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending\n   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can\n   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills\n   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new\n   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that\n   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be\n   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it\n   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if\n   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.\n\nQ: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?\n\nA: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take\n   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the \n   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.\n\nQ: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my\n   practice sessions that way?\n\nA: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain\n   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up \n   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your\n   practice sessions.\n\nQ: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and\n   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?\n\nA: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your\n   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal\n   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,\n   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find\n   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.\n\nQ: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?\n\nA: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair \n   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all \n   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a \"stock\"\n   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly\n   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special\n   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special\n   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted\n   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of\n   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will\n   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.\n\nQ: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?\n\nA: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing\n   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we\n   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you\n   chose to change races.\n\nQ: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available\n   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?\n\nA: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and\n   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for\n   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes\n   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an \"old class\".\n   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level\n   and a few other things like delays on skills.\n\nQ: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?\n\nA: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the\n   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5\n   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,\n   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're\n   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will\n   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort\n   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.\n   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more\n   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be \n   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.\n\nQ: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want\n   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan\n   system?\n\n   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can \n   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be \n   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used\n   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader\n   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change\n   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,\n   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan\n   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).\n\nQ: What about my Mutant characters?\n\nA: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,\n   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not \n   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain\n   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once\n   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to\n   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you\n   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.\n\nQ: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I\n   think of something not covered in this help file?\n\nA: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had\n   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be \n   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that\n   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially\n   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding\n   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an\n   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either\n   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the \n   Admins.\n\nFINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of \n            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note\n\t    to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.  He'll consider\n\t    adding in your question if it hasn't already been answered.\n\n\n~\n\n0 MYRMIDON~\n\nMyrmidon\nConcept - The ultimate campaigner, the myrmidon is a classic soldier.\nThe military life is law to this kit.  Myrmidons live and die for the\nmartial life.  As a result of their rigid adherence to law and order,\nand the chain of command they tend to be strict and inflexible.\nHowever, the myrmidon is also highly trained in standard combat\nand is a skilled and powerful fighter.\n\nBenefits: \n* Specialization is free.  If the myrmidon has a specialization already\nwhen he picks up the kit, he'll be refunded the trains for it.\n* Because of their extensive training in basic combat prowess,\nmyrmidons, when using their specialized weapon, receive second\nand third attacks more often, anywhere from 125% to 150% depending\non the weapon skill percent and the myrmidon's level.\n* Also because of their extensive training, myrmidons receive a\nfourth attack skill.  With 100% in his/her specialized weapon\nand level 51, the myrmidon receives second attacks 75% of the\ntime, third attacks 50% of the time, and fourth attacks 25% of\nthe time.  These only apply with the specialized weapons.\n\nDrawbacks:\n* Because of their regimented martial life, these soldiers are less\nfamiliar with other fighting styles than their own.  As a result, they\nfight at a slight penalty when going up against creatures of a different\nsize (though not of a difference race if the race is the same size).\nThis penalty decreases as the myrmidon levels.\n\n~\n\n0 SPECIALIZE SPECIALIZATION~\nSyntax: specialize <weapon>\n\tspecialize help (displays this help file and costs)\n\nSpecialization is an option available to warriors and warrior reclasses\nSpecialization offers the warrior a better hitroll, more damage, and a\nremote shot at an extra attack.  Warriors and Blademasters may specialize in\nanything.  The warrior reclasses may specialize as follows:\n \n Samurai: sword, polearm, dagger\n Berzerker: sword, mace, axe\n Paladin: sword, flail, mace\n\nNote: In order to specialize, your oldclass must be warrior. IE a cleric\n      paladin cannot specialize, but a warrior paladin can.\n\n ~\n0 PAB 'PLAYER ADVISORY BOARD'~\nThe player advisory board (PAB) is an outlet for the coders to receive feedback about the major concerns for the game. Issues and suggestions brought forth by the PAB do not have to be implemented at all. Keep that in mind.\n\nEach clan will have 1 member on the board, usually the clan leader, but it can be anyone the clan decides to represent them. Clans can call for a change of representation at any time if the motion is supported by 3 different people, not characters. There will be 3 non-clanner positions on the board. Non-clanners will be appointed to the board by the immortal in charge of the PAB after having applied. These positions will be reviewed and possibly rotated on a monthly basis. Members of the player advisory board will receive an extra (PAB) flag by their name and be able to read notes posted to PAB. This will allow the other players to know who to talk to with their concerns. Being a member of the board is not something to be taken lightly, you will be required to post notes, attend meetings, and talk to the player base quite often.\n\nMeetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis. All other correspondence between the PAB will be through notes to all members, or through tells in order to come up with a working note to post. All members of the player advisory board will have their opinions considered, however the most popular idea will be the one that is sent on to the coders. Any questions about the PAB or its function will be answered by the immortal in charge of it at the time. No one else on the imm team is to be contacted concerning the PAB.\n\nImm currently in charge of the PAB: Hobkin\n\nMortals on the PAB have the PAB flag next to their names.\n\n\n~\n\n0 PYROTECHNICS~\n\nThe pyrotechnics spell group involves the creation of explosive materials.\nIts use is currently limited to samurai, monks and assassins. The spells \nare very powerful.\n\nsmall bomb: a small explosive device explodes on the target\nhigh explosive: blasts opponents with a larger bomb\nsmoke screen: obscures vision and allows an escape from combat\n\n**NOTE: Only Monks,Assassins and Samurai's get Smoke Screen **\n~\n\n0 NETHERMANCER NETHERMANCY FADE~\n\n   The Nethermancer is the most mysterious and unpredictable of spellcasters.\nThrough the art of {Cnethermancer{x, this kit can transfer hp to mana and vice\nversa as needed, at an exchange rate of 2::1.  This conversion is automatic.\nA perfect Nethermancer can only be destroyed when both his hit points and mana\nreach 0.  The Nethermancer also has a unique and uncontrollable ability to \nbecome completely invisible at will.  He cannot control when this happens and\nwhen it ceases, though he can force himself to become visible by engaging in\ncombat.  Nethermancers refer to this skill/annoyance as the {Cfade{x.  Finally,\nthe Nethermancer can bestow upon any weapon a special type of enchantment,\ncalled the nether flag.  What this does, nobody knows, and how the Nethermancer\nmanages to do it, nobody knows that either.  Nethermancers are automatically\noutfitted with a set of special robes.  If they lose their robes, they may use\nthe \"outfit\" command to get another set.  \n\nNethermancers cannot wear armor.\nArmor is defined as any item whose item type is armor.\n~\n\n0 BLADESINGER BLADESONG~\n\nSyntax: Bladesong\n        Bladesong stop\n\n   The Bladesinger is a special type of elf combatant.  Through the use of the\n{Cbladesong{x skill, the elven bladesinger receives a variety of bonuses in\ncombat, as well as up to a 25% chance for an extra attack during each combat\nround.  Bladesong can only be performed with a sword or dagger, and cannot be\nused if the bladesinger is wearing a shield.\n\n   Bladesong stop will end your deadly dance with the blades.\n~\n\n0 BATTLERAGER 'KILLING RAGE'~\n\n  The Battleragers are the elite corps of dwarven warriors.  Ragers are \nunstable at best, flying into insane fits of intense rage.  They can actually\ninflate their own hit points through the use of the {Ckilling rage{x, as well\nas receive a variety of other combat bonuses, including a chance at an extra\nattack during each combat round.  Battleragers can only perform the {Crage{x\nwhen wielding an axe, and cannot see their own hit point count while affected\nby the rage.\n~\n\n0 DAETOK~\n  Syntax: daetok\n\n  Dae'Tok is a Yinnish fighting style that cannot be learned by any other race.\nIt involves a style of trainin that Yinn are taught from childhood, and results\nin spectacular accuracy and maximum potential for damage with any form of \nweapon.  All Yinn become better with this skill as they advance in their\ncareers.  Dae'tok increases both the hitroll and damroll, and increases the\nchances of landing {Csecond{x and {Cthird{x attacks.\n\n~\n\n0 RANGERS~\n\n  The ranger is a master of the wilderness.  As such, (s)he fights most\neffectively in nature - plains, forests, hills and mountains, and is\nuncomfortable and ill-at-ease when indoors or in urban areas.  All rangers\nmay declare a species enemy (see {cSPECIES ENEMY{x), and will receive bonuses\nwhen fighting against any player or creature of that species.  The ranger's\ndislike of his/her species enemy is so strong that those creatures are \npenalized in defensive skills when defending against the ranger.  Rangers may\nmove from any sector to any sector for one movement point, and receive +3 \nmoves when they level.  They also may dual wield with any combination of\nweapon types.\n\nNOTE:  When the material table is complete, Rangers will be forbidden from\nwearing armor made from non-natural materials.  This means they'll be \nrestricted to leathers, cloth, wood, and the like.\n~\n\n0 'SPECIES ENEMY'~\nSyntax: species <race>\n\n   Rangers do not have to declare a species enemy, but the cost of this \nfeature is included with the price of the kits, they pay for it whether they\nuse it or not.  The species enemy must be a PC race.  Once you pick one, you\ncan never -ever- change it.  Select wisely.  Rangers fight remarkably well\nwhen going up against their species enemy, and members of that race don't\ndefend as well against the ranger.  You may not declare your own race as your\nspecies enemy.\n~\n\n0 'TUTINDEX'~\n\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n GETTING STARTED        Introduction to MHS\n TUT2\t\t\tPractices and Trains\n TUT3\t\t\tLevels and Rules Changes\n\n~\n\n0 'GETTING STARTED'~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n   Moosehead SLED is based on ROM2.3, so if you've ever played a ROM MUD,\nmany of these elements will be familiar to you.  If you are new to MHS or\nmudding, this file is designed to help you get started.  One of the first\nthings you will want to do is familiarize yourself with the commands.  The\n\"score\" command contains most of the relevent information about your character.\nThe \"worth\" and \"attrib\" commands show your gold/silver line and attributes\nlines seperately.  The \"who\" command lists all the characters that are logged\nin right now (that you can see).  Type \"equipment\" to see what gear your\ncharacter is currently wearing.  The \"inventory\" command lists the things that\nhave on you but are not currently using.  We recommend that you go through\nthe newbie school (type {crecall{x, {cup{x, {cnorth{x to get there) to get\na good head stat. \n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut2'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT2~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 2 \n\nTRAINS and PRACTICES\n   Your character improves by killing beasties and getting experience.  By\ngaining experience you eventually gain levels, which allow you to learn and\nuse new skills, spells, and abilities.  All new skills that you learn will\nbegin at 1% (except recall and scan, which start at 50%).  Although your skills\nwill naturally improve with use, you have to jump-start them by practicing\nthem.  A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will\neventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which\nthis happens is generally very low at low levels.  To practice a skill, you\nneed to locate a trainer (there is one in the Newbie school, follow the\nsigns to find him).  After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your\nclass to practice skills.  To practice a skill, you need to have at least 1\n{Gpractice{x session available (type {Cpractice{x to see how many you have).\nSimply type: {Cpractice <skill_name>{x, where <skill_name> is the skill\nthat you wish to practice.  Do not use quotes.  The skill you selected will\nincrease by a few percentage points.  The higher your {YINT{x is when you\npractice, the more your skills will increase with each {Gpractice{x session.\nThe highest a skill can go with manually practicing is 75%.  For anything\nbeyond that, you'll just have to use the skill and let it improve naturally.\nYou begin with 5 {Gpractices{x and you receive from 1 to 5 more every time\nyou level.  The higher your {YWIS{x is when you level, the more {Gpractice{x\nsessions you receive.\n\n   Your character also has 5 primary {Yattributes{x that summarize his or her\nabilities.  They are: {Ystrength{x, {Ydexterity{x, {Yintelligence{x, \n{Ywisdom{x, {and {Yconstitution{x.  See the individual help files for each \nfor detailed information on how they affect your character.  {YAttributes{x\nstart at a specific value depending on what race and class you selected. To\nimprove your attributes, you use a {Gtraining{x session.  You begin with 3\n{Gtrains{x and after that, you receive 1 more every time you level.  Your\n{Yattributes{x range from 3 to 25, and usually start out between 10 and 15.\nYou will want to train your {YCON{x and {YWIS{x first.  This action also\nrequires a trainer.  There is one in the newbie school.  These trainers are\nnot always the same as the {Gpractice{x trainers.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut3'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT3~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 3\n\nLEVELS and RULES CHANGES\n \n   As your character levels up, some of the game rules will change.  Also,\nyou'll be gradually forced to explore more the game world.  At level 6, you\nwill nol onger be able to enter newbie school, and must locate trainers in \nthe world somewhere.  Your character does not have to worry about the size of\nhis/her armor until level 11, and is able to use the {Crecall{x skill at will\nuntil level 11 as well.  After that, recalling requires the use of deity gifts\n(see {chelp deity{x), spells, or magic items.  The game will warn you about \nthese changes as you approach level 11.\n\n   When you level, it is in your best interests to wear what is called\n\"levelling gear.\"  Anything can technically be \"levelling gear\", but this\nterm generally refers to equipment that people only wear when they are about\nto level.  Usually this equipment gives you bonuses to your {YCON{x, {YWIS{x,\nand {YINT{x (see the helpfiles for each attribute for more information).\nWhere do you find levelling gear?  Ask around and explore, that is your best\nbet.  Note that when you level, the amount of experience that you need to \nreach the next level doesn't change.  Rather, you begin to gradually get less\nexperience for the same monsters.  You'll need to explore and find new monsters\nto slaughter that are more of a challenge.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut4'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 SPELLCRAFT~\n\n   Spellcraft is a special skill in which the spellcaster has studied\nthe metaphysics of spellcasting.  Those skilled with spellcraft are able\nto identify which spells other are casting, whether they are of the same class\nor not.  They also suffer a smaller mana drain when they loose concentration,\ncan sometimes cast a +1 over their normal casting level.  Spellcraft has a\nvariety of other, more subtle effects that make for a more solid \nspellcasting character.  This skill is incredibly difficult to increase.\n~\n\n0 BANKS BANKING DEPOSIT WITHDRAW~\nSyntax: deposit <#>\n        withdraw <#>\n\n   There is one banker in Midgaard, his name is Otho, he can be\nfound on clan road.  You may only deposit eggs into the bank, and they\nmust be in your inventory for you to do it.  Your total number of eggs\nin the bank is listed in your score.  You do not collect interest and \nthere is no minimum balance.  Your eggs are completely safe in the bank.\nNotice that unsavory individuals may hang around and attempt to steal your\neggs when you go to deposit/withdraw them.  The bank is not responsible \nfor stolen eggs.  \n\n~\n\n0 COLOR COLOUR~\n\n   Syntax based on Lope's standard colour code.\n\n   To enable color, type \"color on\".  To disable, type \"color off\".\n\n   This SLED automatically colorizes some elements of the game.  If you do\nnot like our colors, do not turn color on.  If you want to use only a few\nparts of color, get a client and utilize its color features.\n\n   You may use the following in any place to create color; notes, titles,\ntells, channel use, any where.  Please note that if you do not reset the\ncolor to 'normal', your color will bleed.  If you do this, you will be \nfrozen, so be very careful.\n\n    Red:    {{r for {rnormal{x, {{R for {Rbright{x\n    Blue:   {{b for {bnormal{x, {{B for {Bbright{x\n    Green:  {{g for {gnormal{x, {{G for {Gbright{x\n    Yellow: {{y for {ynormal{x, {{Y for {Ybright{x\n    Black:  {{D for {Dblack{x,  {{W for {Wwhite{x\n    Cyan:   {{c for {cnormal{x, {{C for {Cbright{x\n    Magenta:{{m for {mnormal{x, {{M for {Mbright{x\n    NORMAL: {{x resets colors to normal.\n     \n    Proper use of color:\n\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS{{x!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS{x!\n\n    Improper use:\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp>\n    {x\n\n    Get it?  If not, don't use it, please.  We don't issue warnings for\n    stupidity.\n~\n\n\n0 TRADE TRADING MUDTRADER~\nMudTrader 1.1\n\nSyntax: trade <cmd> <arg1> |amount|\n\nCommand Summary\n> trade request <character>\t \t- Start a trade \n> trade accept <character>\t\t- Accept a request to trade\n> trade decline <character>\t\t- Decline a request to trade\n> trade clear\t\t\t\t- Clear the current trade\n> trade cancel\t\t\t\t- Abort current trade\n> trade add <item in inventory>\t\t- Add something to the trade\n> trade add <gold|silver> <amount>\t- Add money to the trade\n> trade remove <item in trade>\t\t- Remove an item from the trade\n> trade remove <gold|silver> <amount>   - Remove money from the trade\n> trade show\t\t\t\t- Display current trade\n> trade approve\t\t\t\t- Finalize trade\n\nMudTrader is a special program that lets the MUD software act as a\nthird-party agent between two players who want to trade something,\nor purchase something from each other.  When you are trading, the money\nand items are removed from your inventory and held in memory.  If you remove\nthe items/money from the trade, leave the room, or cancel/clear the trade,\nyou get them back.  If you approve the trade, they go over to the other\nperson and are no longer yours.  When you are happy with the trade, type\n\"trade approve\" to finalize it.  BOTH traders must type \"trade approve\"\nfor it to work.  If anybody changes the trade, by either adding to it or\nremoving stuff from it, both people must type \"trade approve\" again.\n~\n\n-1 WIZLIST~\n\n        ________      ===============================      ________\n      /+_+_+_+_+_\\    |    The Gods of Moosehead    |    /+_+_+_+_+_\\\n      \\__________/    ===============================    \\__________/\n        |::XXXX|                                           |XXXX::|\n        |X::XXX|              Creator / IMP                |:XXXX:|\n        |XX::XX|               -----------                 |::XXXX|\n\t|XXX::X|        Rusty, The Oxidizing Dragon        |X::XXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|            Benefactor / Coder             |:XXXX:|\n        |XXXX::|               -----------                 |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|       Boogums \"BooglyDude\" McDugal        |::XXXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |:XXXX:|                                           |XXXX::|\n/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\                           /<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\\n\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/       Immortals           \\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\n       |.  /\\ . |            ---------------              |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Alagaster                 | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |               BriarRose  - ADMIN        |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |               KallaLilly                |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Karag                     | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|               Kuno - ADMIN              | . /\\  .|\n       | .//\\.  |               Slodhian - ADMIN          | .//\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       |.  /\\  .|                                         |.  /\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | .//\\  .|     Long live the memory of Mandrake    | .//\\  .|\n        \\. /\\  /         who left before his time.         \\. /\\  /\n         \\ /\\ /    [ IMMORTAL ] Grey Kellam : Mandrake      \\ /\\ /\n          \\/\\/                                               \\/\\/\n           \\/                                                 \\/\nArt by Blackstaff and Sara\n\nLast Updated By Boogums - 30NOV03\n~\n-1 HERO HEROES~\nThe list that follows is that of those who have attained the\nlevel of 52.

Here, anyone of level 52\nor higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the\nusual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;\nexamples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to\ncreation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,\nability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote\nplayers to immortality.\n\nSince immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)\na carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal\nbehavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without\nexplicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please\ndon't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or\nyou'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to\nthis file.\n\nThe duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,\nare topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are\nfraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)\n~\n\n-1 SOCIALS~\n \nThis is a complete list of socials for Moosehead SLED:\nCompiled originally by: Sara\naccuse       adjust      air          apologize     applaud     babble\nbark         bcatch      beckon       beer          bearhug     beg\nbird         bkiss       bleed        blink         blush       boast\nboggle       bonk        bounce       bow           brb         burp\ncackle       caress      charge       cheer         chuckle     clap\nclaw         collapse    comfort      comb          cough       cover\ncower        cringe      criticize    cry           cuddle      curse\ncurtsey      dance       daydream     drool         duck        embrace\nexplode      eyebrow     faint        fart          flare       flash\nflex         flinch      flip         flirt         flutter     fondle\nfrench       frown       fume         gasp          giggle      glare\ngoose        grimace     grin         groan         grope       grovel\ngrowl        grumble     hand         head          hiccup      highfive\nhop          howl        hug          hush          ignore      innocent\ninsane       judge       kiss         knee          laugh       lick\nlove         lust        massage      meditate      moan        moon\nmosh         mutter      nibble       nod           nudge       nuzzle\npant         passout     pat          peck          pie         pinch\npissed       plead       point        poke          ponder      pout\npray         propose     puke         punch         purr        ramble\nraspberry    rofl        roll         rub           ruffle      run\nscratch      scream      serenade     shake         shiver      shrug\nsigh         sing        slap         slobber       smile       smirk\nsnap         snarl       sneeze       snicker       sniff       snore\nsnort        snowball    snuggle      sob           spam        spank\nspit         squeal      squeeze      squirm        stare       stretch\nstrip        stroke      strut        sulk          swoon       tackle\ntease        thank       threaten     tickle        tip         tongue\ntwiddle      type        undress      view          wave        whine\nwhistle      wiggle      wince        wink          wonder      worry\nworship      yawn        yeehaw       yodel         rose\tlaces\ntank\t     starve\t aargh\t      homework\t    puff\tdiffer\nyae\t     lightbulb   voodoo       ogg\t    confused\tbeam\nbite\t     discodance  scuff        whap\t    lag\t\tchortle\nzerbert      twitch      roxbury\n \n~\n\n-1 MERC~\nThis sled is based on Merc 2.1, created by Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn.  \nMerc 2.1 is available as Merc_21.tar.gz from ftp.tcp.com and \nftp.math.okstate.edu.\nE-mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com' to join the merc mailing list.\n\nThanks to ...\n  ...

Their universal greed is the strongest bond between\nany of the existing clanners.\n  \nAvarice is a highly selective clan, who tends to keep its numbers\nlow.  The exclusivity is derived from the clan's lack of trust in\noutsiders, and a desire to have a large market that can be used\nin amassing great wealth in the name of the Avarice clan.\n   \nEntrance Requirements:\n -Must be level 20+\n -Must have the steal skill (above 75%)\n    \nAvarice's great power and wealth must be protected at all costs.  In order\nto ensure that only loyal members to the cause of Avarice are gulded, expect\ntests of your abilities and quests to prove your faithfulness if you\nchoose to join the ranks of Avarice.\n\nAvarice Charter (rules)\n    \n -You MAY attack anyone of a thief-based reclass (thief, rogue, assassin,\n  berzerker, monk)\n -You may NOT attack anyone who is not a thief-based reclass.\n  EXCEPTION:  You are allowed to attack to aid a clanmate who has\n    been attacked.  Note that this doesn't mean you can attack your\n    clanmate, but you may attack anyone who is attacking them.\n -You do NOT group with those outside of your clan EVER. \n -You do NOT help those outside of your clan for free.\n -Read those again.  Avarice does not trust outsiders be they clanners\n  or non-clanners.  You may sell items and services, as this is part \n  of your clan ideals.  But you are not Matookers or Honor.\n -There will be no alliances with any clans.\n\nSee 'help avarice sanction' for sanctioning information.\n\nAvarice is not a sin, it's a way of life...\n~\n\n-1 HONOR~\nIt is a time of ideals,\nof leaders, of followers,\nof love, of friendship,\nof life, of death, of truth...\nof HONOR!!\n\nWe are truly now the new generation of HONOR clansmen and women.\nOur forefathers began the quest for justice and truth a millennia ago, \non the plains of Northern Midgaard.

He was travelling the land and noticed that\nthere was power in the magical arts that was far beyond his or any others'\ncomprehension. He decided from that day forth to unite all pure spellcasters\nso as to fully understand and improve upon the arts of magic. He and his\nfaithful followers travelled the lands of Boinga to search out all those that\nhad the pure blood of magic in their veins. Those who would not join him and\nhis brethren were made to pay with their lives.\n\nHere we are left but a few proud spellcasters who have survived the trials\nof time. Now we shall rise again amongst the ashes of our ancestors. In our\nplight to truly unite the purity of magic, we have been forced to divide\ninto three sects.\n\nThose who adorn the White Robes of Warlock show the purity of magic through\nkindness. Their role in our clan is to guide all young spellcasters to gain\nknowledge of the magical arts.\n\nThose who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.\n\nThose who adorn the Black Robes of Warlock use the darker side of magic to\npunish the renegades who chose not to follow the true path, and defend our\nclan against those who would wage war. \n\nOur goals of the unity of pure magic has made us a very diverse clan, and for\nall those interested you may speak with any member of our clan and they will\nput you in touch with our recruitment officers.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements:\n  \n* You must be a pure spellcaster\n  (mage, cleric, elementalist, druid, wizard, crusader)\n   \nWarlock Charter (rules)\n*  You may not group with any clanner who is a:\n   Mage, Cleric, Elementalist, Druid, Wizard, or Crusader\n   They abuse the art and are to be killed on site.\n\n*  You may group with / help any nonclanner.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 RONOH~\n.\"It is a time of ideals,\n of leaders, of followers,\n of love, of friendship,\n of life, of death...\n of Honor.\"\n\nWE are the new generation of Honor clansmen and women.  Our forefathers\nbegan the quest for justice a millennia ago, on the plains of Northern\nMidgaard.  Blood and tears were shed to regain honor once lost.  In the end,\nClan Honor's strength in numbers allowed for victory, but at a great cost\nin lives.  The evil were caught, drawn, quartered, and hung.  They remain\nthere even today, as a reminder of the folly in betrayal, and the swift hand\nof vengeance.\n \nCLAN Honor's ideals come from the very heart of it's members.

You will also be responsible for petitioning a Knight, \nEarl, or Lord to give you a quest.  Expect a rigorous interview, for the \npaths of false Honor may lead to your own death.\n\n\"May the light of Honor show you the true paths to glory...\"\n                                  --- Thunder\n                                      Clan Father\n                                      \n~\n-1 NOIGEL~\nThe Legion of the Goblin Hoard.\nLong ago a new race was formed, offshoots from the human race, the Goblin\ncame into being. They were a peacefull kind, only wishing to keep their \nrace going, raising cattle, and growing crops.  But as outsiders came to \nthe lands of the Goblins and tried to take over their farmland, it became \nobvious they would need some kind of defense, an army of some sort to fend \noff the newcommers.  And so was formed the Legion.\n\nThe Legion has one reason for being, and that is to keep the Goblins alive.\nIf you are a Goblin, and want to stand up for yourself in this world of\nraces far bigger then the Goblins, then the Legion is the place for you.\nThe Legion does not wish to seek out battle, we just wish to defend ourselves.\nAny race can join the Legion, but only a Goblin can ever hope to become\nanything more then just a guardsman.\n\nIf you wish to join the Legion, to help the Goblin race survive, you must\ncontact one of the leaders, or a recruiter, in a note or when you meet one\non-line. You must be able to roleplay, because the Legion is a clan formed \naround roleplaying and it is imperitive that you can do so to join this clan. \nIf you are a non-goblin then you may have to prove yourself worthy of \nprotecting the Goblins, because it would be a horrible thing if we recruited \nthe weak for this task.\n\nLONG LIVE THE LEGION!\n~\n\n-1 ELCRIC~\nThe Clan Circle\n\n    \"As one I am weak, but as many we are strong.  We are the Keepers of\nMagic.  We are the Magi of Clan Circle, Never Ending and Ever Lasting.\"\n\n    Magic.  It is the lifeblood of the universe.  It is magic that drives\nus, and it is in magic that we find true power.  This is the founding belief\nof clan Circle.  Through magic, any problem can be solved, any obstacle over-\ncome.  The main goal of Circle is to encourage and foster the development\nand increased use of magic, through the use of our own magic, power, and\nstrength.\n\n    The members of Clan Circle reside in the Tower, a massive building in \nwhich we work our spells.  Members of Circle receive free spell-ups, enchants,\ncorpse retrievals, and all of the other benefits that one would expect from a\nclan.  Although all clan members are expected to be willing to help others,\nthe Mentors of Circle are dedicated to this task.  The Guardians of Circle \nare the clan's military force, ready to fight at a moment's notice, and\nwilling to sacrafice their lives in defense of our ideals, members, and magic.\n\n    Roleplaying is *not* required to join Circle.  The only roleplaying\nthat is asked of all members is that you keep your characters seperate, as per\nthe basic \"no multiplaying\" rule of MHS.  We do encourage members to roleplay\nand develop their characters, but we do not require it.  Tithing of income\nis also encouraged but not required.\n\nCircle Leadership and Law\n\n    Circle is overseen by the Conclave, a council of 7 leaders who are\nelected or appointed from the clan.  There are very few defined rules in \nCircle.  We are a clan, we are Magi, we are family.  All members of Circle\nare given as much personal freedom as possible, and in return, we expect \nthat all members take responsibility for their actions, words, and beliefs.\n\nJoining Circle\n\n    Any race or class can join Circle.  Although our specialty is magic,\nand we generally only actively recruit mages and clerics, warriors and thieves\nare welcome to apply for admission.\n\n    The is only one requirement to join Circle.  Mages and Clerics must\nhave at least 8 spell groups, and Warriors and Thieves must have at least 3.\nBecause dragons are very difficult and timely to advance, the draconian spells\nare considered a spell group for the purpose of meeting this requirement.\n\n    If you wish to join Circle, talk to a Recruiter.  Any Inner Circle\nor Outer Circle is also a Recruiter.  If no recruiter is available, then post\na note to Circle, informing us of your race, class, and current level.  All\napplicants will be given a thorough interview, and some will be asked to \ncomplete a quest.\n\n                                  - Clan Circle, Never Ending, Ever Lasting\n~\n\n-1 LONER~\nLoners are individualists, standing alone from any Clan, but subject\nto the same rules as clanners with respect to pkilling, pstealing,\nand transportation spells.  By definition, Loners have no common\nhall, no leaders, and no affiliation among each other, save what they\nagree upon for themselves.\n\nTo become a Loner simply issue the 'loner' command between levels 5\nand 20.  This command -cannot- be reversed under any circumstance.\nDo it carefully.\n~\n\n-1 ECNALAB~\nIn life there are those who take, those who give, those who lead and\nthose who follow.  Seldom are they one and the same, but this is the\nland of Boinga, the land where the beautiful princess Alia once\nstepped. She had a vision, a vision of a family where to lead and to\nfollow to give and to take were equally respected by all who were\npart of the family of BALANCE.\n\nIn the days when Alia walked among us we were happy, at peace and\nable to console ourselves that we were no-one's master and no-one's\nslave. But Alia left this realm and chaos ensued. We strived to\nbecome what she had taught us and when we achieved it she did walk\namong us again.  Dissention was rife and soon after her visitation\nBalance fell under internal turmoil and deceit; the few feeling\nthat they took precedence over the many...\n\nAnd so this continued until one day few were left. They decided\nto make their own way and live the teachings of Alia rather than\nfollow them, throwing scorn on the likes of Riders those who would\nhave sheep rather than friends.\n\nWith that Balance was reborn!\n\nBalance is a family of members, none being any more important than\nany other. We strive for total equality and are in a constant\nstate of war with Riders, who see some fit to be ranked far above\nothers.  To join Balance just speak to any full member and they\nwill give you an interview (or arrange one for later). A full member\nis one who has been in the clan for 6 levels (or 20 days at 51). This\nis so new members have time to learn the ways of Balance before \ncompleting entrance into our clan.\n\nThe Current Speaker of Balance is Rigger.\nThe speaker of Balance is the person who is elected to be the\nspokesperson to the outside world.\n~\n\n-1 ESIMED~\nChildren of Demise\n\n        Darkness swallows light, death extinguishes life, and hope is but a \nfoolish dream. All things must come to an end, and the Children of Demise\nfaithfully help the end come quicker. We willingly bear the burden of life,\nso we can help the unbelievers on into the everlasting darkness. To enter\nthe darkness serving the faith is the greatest priviledge. To crush all\nhope and happiness is one the many steps to our eventual success.\nI, Eiji, am the father of Demise. I have come forth from the shadows to bring\nthe words and wisdom of Demise. There is no stopping our tide. We shall \nprevail.\n\nClan Demise\n\n        Clan Demise consists of a cult with a inner hierarchy. You rank\nis based on your level, your acts in the name of Demise, and your Role-\nplaying. Clan Demise allows pking, pstealing, and other cruel activities.\nWe work together as a tight unit, planning carefully all ventures.\nIf thou wishest to join Demise, expect a serious questioning from members.\nThey tolerate no stupidity, foolhardiness, or insolence.\nROLE-PLAYING is a MUST.\n~\n\n-1 DEMISE~\nAbove, in the planes of the Deities lies one of true evil.  His power is fueled\nby destruction and vengeance that are channeled through the wrath of his \nglorious children!  We are the Children of Cthon!  Spawns of Hell, Delivers \nof Death, Vengeance and Chaos.  We are the elite army of the greatest \npower.  We bare the burden of life to crush all hope and extinguish all life, \nmaking Cthon ever so much stronger! \n\nThose within our ranks have the privilege of serving the greatest evil.  As such\nCthon himself grants the elite army with speed and aura of fear that makes \nour enemies cower in fear with our power!  Possessing so much power we \nharness it and war with every existing clan, loner and outcast.  No treaty or \nbond between clans is powerful enough to stop our storm,  for we come for \nyou?always. In the words of wisdom of Eiji, the father of Demise, \"There is no\nstopping our tide! We shall prevail!\"\n\nClan Demise\n\nTo enter Clan Demise is a feat in itself.  Do not come looking for us.  We \nwill come to you.  Show us your power by killing and looting.  Any attack \non you consider it a test.  You must also be a minimum of level 15, and  \neven then, when we feel you are ready you fill be asked to join and no \nsooner.\n\nClan Demise is a cult of inner hierarchy, in which your rank is on the basis\nof your level,  your acts in demise, and other cruel activities.  If you do not\nmaintain your power and skills you will be outcasted and hunted by your \nformer clan.  No stupidity, foolishness or insolence is allowed, and  \nrole-playing is a must.  \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You must have a Thug or Killer flag\n\nDemise Charter (rules)\n{YGROUPING{x or {YWORKING{x with anyone outside the clan is *expressly* \nforbidden!

Let us pray...\"\n\nThe words of the Almighty are spoken, and his children wake, and listen.\nThese children are known for their devotion to the Almighty, the one\ntrue God of Boinga. Teachers, Warriors, Healers, Sages, Young and old\nalike, they bind together under one holy creed. Seeking out the false\nfaiths and their unholy prophets, they continue steadfastly to cleanse\nthe lands of the evil that has spawned within the hearts of pagan\nmen.\n\nThese children of the Almighty, from all walks of life, are bound\nheart, mind, and soul to a common purpose, and a common name:\n\nZealot.\n\nThe faithful of the Almighty have but one purpose:  to annihilate the\nfalse faiths of the lands through any means necessary.\n\nNoone shall be considered neutral.  All will fall before the might of\nthe Almighty!\n\nEntrance Requirements:\nNone\n\nZealot Charter (rules)\nYou may not group with or work with any other clanners.  They all\nserve false gods.  You may work or group with nonclanners as \ntheir gods have already been conqured by the Almighty and they are\nonly humoring themselves.\n\n~\n-1 'ZEALOT RANKS'~\n----------------------------Ranking----------------------------\n\n/1 The Light of the Almighty. [*]\nThe members of the light are entrusted with the task of spreading\nthe teachings of the Almighty. They proclaim his holy glories to\nthe heathen nations, distribute holy scripture, heal and aid fellow\nbrethren in the congregation. They aid in the equipping and teaching\nof new recruits of the Almighty's Church. They may also aid in the\ncleansing of heathens or errant pledges, but this is not required.\nThey also aid the recruiters in bringing new recruits into the clan.\n\n/2 The Hand of the Almighty. [!]\nThe members of the hand concentrate their skills to the task of\neliminating false prophets and heathens. They seek out the heathen\nfilth and send their souls to the light via a bloodshed cleansing.\nThe creed: \"There is no forgiveness of sin without the shedding of\nblood.\" is very dear to them, and each has taken this crusade to\nheart. They also may aid in the gathering of new recruits, but this\nis not their main task.\n\n/3 The Crown of the Almighty. [^]\nThese members seek to enforce clan policy through intervention\nwhen the recruiters or the Anointed are unavailable. They report\ndirectly to the Anointed any violation that they witness within the\ncongregation, and are appointed only by the Anointed. Their prime\ntasks are the purging of false pledges, and to aid in collection of\nfunds of the clan.\n\nAll Ranks: Inquisitors.\nDue to vile forces of greed and lust, power struggles within the\nclan are all too frequent. The Inquisitors seek out those within\nthe clan whose faith in the Almighty and whose loyalty to the Anointed\nare weak or insubordinate. They report to the Grand Inquisitor or\ndirectly to the Anointed, who then deliberate on any action which\nmight be necessary to quell the disturbance. Who is an inquisitor?\nThat knowledge is only kept by the Grand Inquisitor and by the Anointed.\nAll inquisitors are chosen by the Grand Inquisitor or the Anointed. Any\ninquisitor who exposes his status can expect to have it revoked at best,\nor become an outcast at worst.\n\nRanks 1-3 are considered equal in all aspects, and shall be treated\nas such. No one rank is superior to the other, and should not become\nboastful over his brothers. Such boasting breeds intolerance and resentment,\nand is highly frowned upon.\n\n/4 The Preacher of Light, The Hand of Destruction, The Crowning Glory\nThe Holy Scribe, The Grand Inquisitor, Protectors of the Faith.\nThese select positions are hand picked by the Anointed, and given\nresponsibility of recruiting, as well as tending to their own\nbranch affairs. None possesses any rank above the other, and all report\ndirectly to the Anointed. These members also collect funds from the\nclan.\n\n/5 The Anointed of the Almighty.\nThese chosen children of the Almighty oversee all that happens within\nthe church of the Almighty. These people are said to be the direct\nvoice of the Almighty, and obediance of their decrees is required.\nThese people have complete control of the congregation, but may seek\nadvice on internal matters as they so choose.\n~\n\n\n\n-1 POSSE~\nA band of evil beings roamed the lands, spreading fear and chaos,\nkilling, looting, and bringing havoc to the world.  Within this band\nwere a few consumed with guilt, which could no longer bear the screams\nand death cries of the fallen.  Straying from their evil ways, they\nformed a Posse.\n\nThe Posse would no longer stand by and let criminals walk freely about\nthe world.  Thus, Posse attacks all KILLERS, THIEVES, THUGS, and\nRUFFIANS.  In doing so, Posse has made a few enemies along the way.\n\nPosse does not wage war upon any clan.  We strive to kill all KILLERS,\nTHIEVES, THUGS, and RUFFIANS, dealing swift justice where possible.\nTaking this into account, no member of Posse is to carry any of the \nabove flags, with the exception of the Ruffian flag.  We are of the\nunderstanding that sometimes excessive force is necessary, and also\nthat accidents _do_ happen.  Should other flags occur, each such incident\nwill be judged on its merits.  As a general rule, Thug flags are usually\nunacceptable at best and Killer and Thief flags are almost always an\noutcastable offense.  Exceptions can be made for bugs and extenuating\ncircumstances, again as the situation dictates.\n\nWe are not a group of individuals, we are a Clan family of sorts, in that\nwe help each other out whether it be pkilling, eq, grouping, spell-ups, \nor even just to sit and talk.  We do not group with those that carry\nflags, but will deal with them for goods if it is for the good of our\ngreater cause and they are deemed trustworthy enough to do so.\n\nPosse consists of those who are Good, Neutral, and Evil.  All races\nand classes are considered in joining, but we do not accept just anyone.\nPlayers are urged to talk to a recruiter at an early age/level as to\nnot invest too much time into a character who will be turned down.\nTeamwork is a _must_, as is clan/pkill experience.  Roleplaying is not\nrequired.\n\nSanctions will be handed out to those members of posse who have trouble\nfollowing the posse charter. These can be given by both /4s and /5s and\nwill generally last for the duration of your flag. However, if the /4 or /5\nyou ask to remove you sanction feels that you have not yet served your time\nthey will post a note to the clan stating why they feel that way and how\nlong they feel you should keep the sanctions. It will then be upto a /5 to\nremove the flag. Sanctions will be handed out as follows:\n\nRuffian - Skill, Store, Portal Room, Regen, Healer\nThug - Healer, Regen, Skill, Store, Portal Room, Hall for 1 week.\nKiller and Thief - Immediate outcast, no questions asked. \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You may not have a flag (see definition below).\n\nPosse Charter (rules)\n\n- any member of any clan that carries a flag (Killer, Thief, Thug or Ruffian),\n  is to be killed.\n- No member of Posse may carry any flag. Carrying a flag is grounds for \n  sanctions. The worse the flag the worse the sanctions.\n- Grouping with or helping any member of any clan with any flag is forbidden.\n~\n-1 SREDIR REDIR~\nAnd when He opened the seal there went out a horse that was red, and power was\ngiven unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that its\ninhabitants should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great\nsword...\n\nAnd behold there came forth an ashen horse, and he that sat upon him had a pair\nof balances in his hand; with a measure of wheat on one side and a mound of\ndust on the other.  And the power was given unto him to steal that which\nnourishes the body--and the spirit...\n\nAnd lo a black horse then appeared, and he that sat upon him bore a bow whose\narrows flew across the sky as an infectious cloud; and unto him the power to\ndisfigure and drain away the life of Man was given...\n\nAnd behold a pale horse arose; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell\nfollowed with him...\n\nAnd power was given unto them over the four parts of the Earth; to kill with\nthe Sword, and with Hunger, with Disease, and with Death...And lo there was a\ngreat earthquake; and the Sun became as black as sackcloth, and the Moon became\nas blood, and the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth...\n\nFor when the great day of His wrath has come...who shall be able to stand?\n\nMAKE WAY FOR THE APOCALYPSE...\n\n[Premise]\nWe are a lawful organization constrained by the inevitability of the End; we\nare but harbingers of the coming Apocalypse.  We do not seek out conflict or\ndestruction, nor do we believe in pkilling and pstealing with impunity.  Our\npurpose is not to bring about the End but rather to facilitate what inevitably\nmust, and will be.\n\nThose who wish to become minions of the Apocalypse must request an audience\nwith the proper Incarnation.\n\nWarriors should direct their requests for membership to WAR.\nThieves should direct their requests for membership to FAMINE.\nClerics should direct their requests for membership to PESTILENCE.\nMages should direct their requests for membership to DEATH.\n~\n\n-1 OUTCAST OUTCASTS~\nOutcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They\nare, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in\ntheir lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are\na few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:\n\n-- Attacking a fellow clan member\n-- Stealing from a fellow clan member\n-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan\n-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership\n-- Receiving a DWEEB flag\n-- Spying for another Clan\n-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention\n\nOnce someone has been Outcast, they may not rejoin another clan unless\na voucher is purchased, these cost 50eggs. \n\n~\n\n-1 DWEEB~\nDweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the\ngods themselves.  A Dweeb is given no safe haven, as they are allowed to be\nattacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can\nbestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for\na Dweeb flag:\n\n-- Continually spamming the public channels.\n-- Continually harrassing particular players.\n-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.\n-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.\n-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.\n-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.\n-- Using CB lingo on public channels\n-- Using l33t speak on public channels\n   (You don't look cool, you look like an idiot.  Real hackers don't use\n    it.  Quit watching TechTV.)\n\nNote that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings\nbefore you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to\nhave done something truly horrendous.\n\nAlso, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the\nperiod of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you\nmust live with it.\n~\n\n-1 MATOOK~\nHelp 'Matook'\nMatook is an organized group of characters that have shown interest\nin dedicating their time to helping out other individuals as they\ncan.  This can involve spell ups, retrieving equipment, corpse\nretrievals, enchantments, and other miscellaneous  tasks that the\nindividual is willing to do.\n\nThe helpers of Matook gathered together and created a Grand Church\nin the North-Western Corner of Midgaard. Here in the Church many\nhelpful souls can be found, as well they have provided fast healing\nand mana recouperation rooms for the needy.\n\nIf you believe in yourself to follow the ways of Matook and wish to\njoin their order be prepared to give an example of your skill and\nknowledge of Boinga.  You will be directed to speak with a member of\nthe Council who will bestow a quest upon you. Any Matooker will be\nwilling to answer any further questions about the the Church in\ngeneral and please don't be shy to ask for some assistance in any\narea. Of course, since Matookers are non-clanners, clan interference\nis always forbidden.\n\n\"One cannot love with anger and hate for fear will always ruin one's\nfate...To live a life full of peace one must love or see it decrease.\"\n\n-May Matook Protect You.\n\n~\n\n-1 DONATION DONATIONS~\n\nThe DIKU liscence states that I can not take any money from anyone \nplaying MHS.

This character has\nnot yet been refreshed. If you 'continue' you will go through parts of the\ncreation process allowing you to change parts of your character to better\nbalance you within the game. If you 'quit' this character remains unrefreshed\nand you can do it at another time.\n\nYou can test pfreshing a character by logging into the OLC Port instead of\nhere with this character. Login to sled.moosehead.com port 8080. Once you\npfresh a character on port 4000 you can not undo or retry it.\n\nIf you have any questions as to what this process involves we recommend\n'quit' and create a new character and read 'help pfresh' once you are in\nthe game and ask questions of the other players and Immortals.\n~\n\n52 JOBS~\nAs an Immortal on MHS, there are certain things expected of you, and\nespecially as a newer immortal, you should be mindful of exactly what\nit is you're supposed to be doing.  Below is a short summary of what's\nexpected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.\n\nNote:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.\n\nAll levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is\ncheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of\na higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings\nwith mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as\nyou would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of\nan Immortal.\n\n52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive\nor have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,\nsave to follow the same rules as everyone else.\n\n53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an\nImmortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how\nyou act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if\nyou are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be\nplaced at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the\nrules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the\nland, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of\nbeing an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob\nstrength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking\nquestions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.\n\n55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available\nto you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'\nstage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level\nwhere you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be\ngiven a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations\nat this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn\nOLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.\nYou have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any\nmajor decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced\nImmortal.\n\n57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to\nImmortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used\nto penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you\nshould have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,\nand a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at\nthis level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,\nbuild on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.\nYour conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but\nyou're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'\nonce you've reached this point.\n\n58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp\nof the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any\nsituation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to\nSenior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some\nof the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all\nImmortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected\nfor their dedication to MHS.\n\n59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still \nkeeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have\ntheir hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available\non MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,\nyou have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,\nor you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure\nabout, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS\ninside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins\nare also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new\ncode for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.\n\n60 - Implementor.  If you need to be told what your job as an Implementor\nis, you should probably put down the crack pipe now...\n\n~\n\n-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~\nYou may kill other players once you join a Clan or Loner.  If they are \nmore than 8* levels below you, you can't do it.  If your intended victim\nis not in a Clan, again you can't touch them (unless they have a THIEF \nor DWEEB flag). You may steal from other players if they are not more \nthan 7* levels below your level, and in a Clan. For either of the above \nactions you will recieve a flag and may have trouble with guards in town.  \nAlso other players may get to attack you.\n\nThere are specific ways to get certain flags:\n(Tf) A thief flag is gotten for failing an attempt at stealing from a \n     player.  You may be attacked by anyone up to 12 levels above you\n     when you have this flag.  It can only be lost by dying to another\n     player while you have no other flags.\n(R)  A ruffian flag is gotten from initiating combat on an unflagged \n     player. This flag has no consequence except saving someone who \n     attacks you from receiving a flag.  This flag is lost by dying to \n     another player.\n(Th) A thug flag is received if you actually kill a player. This \n     enables people up to 10 levels above you to attack you .  This \n     flag is lost by dying to a player either 1 or 2 times depending \n     on the number of players killed as a thug.\n(K)  A killer flag is earned by killing 3 players without dying in \n     between. The consequence is that {YANYONE{x may attack you. \n     The flag is lowered to a thug flag upon death at the hands of \n     another player.  When attacking somebody who origionally isn't \n     able to attack you, that person gains the right to attack you \n     until they have killed you.\n\nIs it worth it?  You decide.\n\n~\n\n52 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~\n.\n                         **********************\n                         ** The Rules of MHS **\n                         **********************\n \n1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.\n    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.\n \n2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. \n    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,\n    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    \n    and softening up or altering mobs.\n \n3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.\n    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly\n    go there themselves.\n \n4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.\n \n5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.\n \n6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie\n    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items\n    isn't.\n \n7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT \n    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some \n    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels\n    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).\n \n8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you \n    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore\n    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.\n \n9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  \n \n10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal\n    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.\n\n11) Do not argue with level 59 or 60 IMM's.  You're wrong, just admit it!\n~\n-1 PUFF~\nNo plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --\nHe grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.\nCompiles and simulations grew so quickly tame\nAnd swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.\nCHORUS:\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\nPuff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails\nAnd mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.\nAll the student hackers loved that fractal Puff\nBut DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, \"Enough!\"\n                (chorus)\nPuff used more resources than DCS could spare.\nThe operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.\nA gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,\nBut Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!\n                (chorus)\n~\n\n-1 CLIST~\nThis is a list of currently active clans on MHS.  For more details,\nsee the clan's helpfile \"help <clan name>\"\n\nHonor: A group of noble warriors, united in a common cause against\n       the evils of Boinga.\n\nDemise: A clan of bloodthirsty killers, solely intent upon the\n        destruction of good.\n\nWarlock: A clan of spellcasters, devoted to the preservation and\n         purity of magic.\n\nZealot: A group of religious fanatics, intent on preaching the word\n        of their God, and converting nonbelievers by any means\n        necessary.\n\nPosse: A militia who charge themselves with the eradication of\n       lawbreakers.\n\nLoner: Not members of a true clan, these warriors venture forth\n       into the dangerous lands of Boinga, with nobody to rely\n       on but themselves.\n\nOutcast: Once members of a clan, they have either left their old\n         life behind, or been banished forever for bring harm\n         upon their former brethen.\n\nSee the appropriate clan helpfile for more information, or speak with\na clan leader or recruiter (denoted by a rank of /5 or /4, respectively)\n~\n\n-1 RULES~\nThese are the rules of MHS.  For other matters, use common sense.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at ANY God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be\n  tolerated.\n\n* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods\n  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.\n  Please MAIL these bugs to: cascadia@nventure.com\n\n* Seerated player stealing or player killing.  Clanned players will NOT\n  involve non-clanned players in player killing in any way.  Non-Clanned\n  players will NOT intentionally involve themselves in player killing.\n  This includes spelling up clanners so they can go pkilling, or who are\n  being pkilled themsleves.  Nonclanners also cannot stand near pfights\n  and take disarmed weapons or fallen stones.\n\n* Summoning mobs and sleeping them at other aggresive mobs is forbidden.\n  If you summon Papa to the Dees and sleep Papa, and a nonclanner or \n  clanner gates to Papa, expect to be punished.  If you want to use Papa\n  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other\n  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive. \n\n  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or\n  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie\n  without their permission still is illegal.\n\n* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.\n  This includes using a script away from your terminal.\n  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.\n  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you\n  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your\n  typing woes, not play your character for you.\n\n* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with \n  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters, \n  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1 \n  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under \n  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are \n  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that \n  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,\n  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special\n  privileges. \n  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know\n  who someone's \"alt\" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over\n  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are\n  seperate.\n\n* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait\n  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between\n  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait\n  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.\n\n* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.\n  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.\n  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.\n  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too\n\n (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from\n  a pfight then dont take it.)\n\n* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless\n  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with\n  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the\n  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.\n\n* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and\n  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for \n  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are\n  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that\n  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To\n  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob\n  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with\n  them do not help them level.\n\n* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to\n  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.\n\n* Channel \"spamming\" and personal attacks on someone over public channels\n  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to\n  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse\n  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,\n  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.\n\n* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly\n  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you\n  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised\n  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.\n\n* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave\n  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while\n  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill \n  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT\n  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.\n  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal\n  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less\n  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.\n\n  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)\n  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)\n  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go\n   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).\n \n* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be\n  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have\n  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to \n  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage\n  character shall be denied.\n\n* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow\n  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is \n  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.\n\n* Other rules for clanned players are found in \"Help Clan\"\n\n* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and\n  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent\n  to Boogums (cascadia@nventure.com) \n\n* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty\n  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for\n  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could\n  increase the duration of your penalties.\n\n* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.\n  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs\n  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when\n  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base\n  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on\n  the web that have posting boards for such thins, such as:\n  http://www.mudconnector.com/\n\n* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same\n  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break \n  these rules.\n\n* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you\n  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means\n  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in\n  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your\n  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are\n  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.\n\n* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential\n  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so \n  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing\n  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or\n  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts\n  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections\n  are logged and will be watched.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be \n  tolerated.\n\n* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor \n  do the PEOPLE who run the game owe you anything.\n\n~\n\n0 SUICIDE DELETE~\nUse the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be\navailable for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,\nand you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will\nreturn your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the\nfirst delete.\n~\n \n0 HEALER~\nThe healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some\nservices are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see\na full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To\nreceive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.\n~ \n\n\n-1 GAIN~\nThe gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has \nbeen found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:\n\ngain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned\ngain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost\ngain apply :  turns 10 skill points into one practice \n\nGain uses practices to gain new skills, spell groups, and kits.\nGained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total\nnumber of creation points. \n~\n\n52 CLONE~\nSyntax:\n  clone obj <object>\n  clone mob <mobile>\n  clone <name>\n\nThe clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile\nthat may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in\nthe same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is\npreserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or\nmobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  \nStrung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.\n~\n\n\n0 SKILLS SPELLS~\nThe skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list\nof available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in\norder of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)\nlisted where applicable.\n~\n0 'SKILL POINTS'~\nSkill Points are rewarded to you for using your various skills in a \ncombat situation.  You cannot \"spam up\" a skill and get skill points.\nYou need to actually get out and do stuff.\n\nThey may be converted with the 'gain apply' command at the appropriate\nguildmasters into practices.\n~\n\n0 OUTFIT~\nThe outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with\na new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), \ncourtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.\n~\n\n0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT FULLSAC~\nMHS uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting\ngold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:\n\nautolist  : list all automatic actions\nautoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles\nautogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles\nautosac\t  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)\nautoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room\nautosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members\nautoassit : makes you help group members in combat\nfullsac   : able to sacrifice containers with items inside\n\nTyping a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. \n~ \n-1 CLAN CLANS~\nThroughout Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common\ncause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the\nspread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.\n\nIn order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,\neither by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name\nof their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4\nbeside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as\nfollows:\n\nYou must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast\nof any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either\njoined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.\n\nOnce you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If\nfor some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you\nmust first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  After outcasting you must\npurchase a voucher (not a cheap item) to gain access into a new clan. \nAlso, be wary, for those who make frequent changes in their clan find \nthemselves clanless quickly.\n\nExpect to be full looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your\nlife miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, however with that said\nthere must be an appeal to your humanity. Understand how full looting some\none makes them feel. Yes you've had it done to you, yes its a part of\nthe game. Do you really want to have a hand in driving off the player base?\nFind better ways to enjoy the game, help people stay and play. The larger\nthe player base grows the more fun you'll have and the more targets you'll\nhave. \n\nSee HELP CLIST for a list of currently active clans on MHS, and a brief\ndescription of the purpose of each clan.\n~\n-1 PRICES PRICE~\nPrice upgrades for clans\n==============================================================================\nThe prices below are for clans only.

The name of the \nmob should be changed to 'roaming blah blah blah' so for Demise it\nwoudl be 'roaming guard of cthon' or something like that.  that way\nwe can find them easily.

You may pay for \ntraining for your entire guard corps.  This training includes \nall guards on staff at your branch hall. Should decide to hire more \nguards, they will have the same level of training and ability \nas your existing corps.   Prices for training your guards or \nhiring new guards are found in the {YPRICES{x helpfile.\n\nClan leaders are responsible for the descriptions of the equipment, \nhowever stats and affects of the equipment has been predetermined \nand will be the same for all clans.  This is not negotiable or \nupgrade-able.  \n\nYou may have a maximum of 2 guards per room.\n\nA Guard Eq set consists of a helmet, a shield, gloves, a torso item,\nand boots.  \n\nBranch offices will be open to all clanners, that is\nwhy you have a guard, who will sound the alarm should an\nenemy invade your branch hall.\n\nYou will be provided one (1) one way door into your branch\nclan hall from the portal room of your Main hall.  To return \nto your main hall, you will have to use your traditional \nmeans of transportation.  The branch halls are nowhere, \nmeaning people scanning from outside your hall cannot see you. \nHowever, you will not be able to use scan from inside your \nbranch hall.  You will have to go outside. The entrance to \nyour branch hall is a secret entrance.    \n\nClan leaders can purchase upgrades and additions for their \nbranch hall, but remember, all clanners can get into your \nalls and have access to anything in there, so build wisely.\nPrices for additions to your branch halls are the same as\nthose in the \"help prices\" file.  Branch halls may not have \nportals or obs rooms.  Branch halls may not have locking doors, \nprivate rooms, owner only, or clan specific only rooms.  \nEvery room in a branch hall will be open to all clanners.\n\nPortals are NO LONGER AVAILABLE you may put a branch hall in an area of your\nchoosing.\n\nImmortals:\nSee the help BHALLS file for vnums.\n~\n0 DOT 'DAMAGE OVER TIME'~\n\nDamage Over Time (also called DOT) affects are special types of spell affects.\nA DOT affect doesn't cycle with normal spell affects, it has its own timer\nand is not looked at during normal ticks.  DOTs use a special, faster tick\nthat kicks in every 10 seconds.  When this tick hits, the DOT runs its course,\ndoing damage to the victim.  Some DOT spells also do direct damage up front, but\nthis isn't a requirement of a DOT affect.  Most DOTs have no cure, but do low\namounts of damage, so low they often fall under the damage curve.  But for this\nvery reason, DOTs are also quite powerful, as they can do hundreds of points of\ndamage and none of it gets curved.  The cost is time, as a victim of a DOT can\nuse several tactics to reduce the effectiveness.  Most DOTs last 1-2 minutes \nand do gradually less damage as they go.  Many things affect how much damage\na DOT does, and none of those secrets will be divulged here.\n\nThe Shaman kit is the best in the game, having access to an elite corp of DOT\nspells in the 'disease' group.  No DOT can rival the power of these spells.\nOther, more mundane DOT spells exist.\n\n~\n0 $~\n\n#$\n","position":334},"values":[{"header":"HELPS","file":"0 ASSEMBLE","name":"Usage:   assemble <part>\n\n    The assemble command is used to combine items with item_type \n\"PART\" to create a new item.

Loners and Outcasts, not being organized clans,\ndictate their own actions as they see fit.\n\n    The charters are there to define your clan, and to set rules for\nmembers of your clan to follow.  Leaders and recruiters are expected\nto know these rules, and explain them in detail to new recruits.\n\n    Charters are to be followed to the letter.\n~\n\n\n0 ABOLISH~\nUsage:  abolish <player>\n\n    Abolish is a Paladin-only skill that allows them to cure\ndiseases with a touch, by a direct act of divine intervention.\nHowever, a Paladin's god will not grant this power frequently,\nand there is a period of time the Paladin must wait before being\ngranted the power to Abolish again.  This delay grows shorter as\nthe Paladin ages and gains experience.\n\n~\n\n0 'CONE OF SILENCE'~\nUsage:  cast 'cone of silence' <target>\n\nThis spell, if it lands, will envelope the vicitm in a cone of \nsilence.  They will be unable to cast, chant, or use any of\nthe communication channels.\n\nThis spell requires a component.  The component can be found\non a certian dominatrix in the City of Thives.  If the casting\nof this spell fails, there is also a chance that it will fire back\non the caster, causing them to be wrapped in the cone.\n\n~\n0 BOUNTY~\nUsage:   bounty <victim> <amount>\n         bounty show\n\n    Bounties may be set by any clanner on any other clanner, even a \nplayer in your own clan.  The victim will be notified that a bounty\nhas been raised on him/her, but (s)he won't know by who.  The bounty\nis measured in gold.  You MUST have the gold on you to set the bounty.\nBounties can be set anywhere at any time.  Bounties are cumulative,\nand will accumulate until the victim is slain.  They can never be\ntaken back.  You may place multiple bounties on the same person.  \nTo see who is logged on that has a bounty, type 'bounty show'.  The\nbounty will be automatically deposited into your 'gold' count once \nyou kill the victim.  There are some specific rules on bounties, see\n'help rules' for details.  Ignorance of these rules is no excuse to\nbreak them or the spirit of them.\n\n~\n\n0 'MEDIUM'~\n\n   The medium is a very simple kit.  The Medium is throughly connected\nto the physical world, and is able to enhance the regen of anybody in\nthe same room.  All hit point, mana, and move gains are increased by\na ratio to the medium's level for others in the same room.  This is not\na skill, simply an inate ability of the medium.  The medium has no other\nskills or abilities.  The medium does, of course, increase his/her own\nregen as well, and at all times.\n~\n\n0 'WITCH'~\n\nWarlocks and Witches are two parallel kits.  They have the same skills\nand requirements.  One is for males and the other for females.  These\ntwo kits are for mages and wizards, and are combination offense-\nenhancement kits.  They receive five spells.\n\n immolate  :: A fire damage spell comprable to acid blast\n lacerate  :: The most damaging non-breath weapon spell in the game\n clarity   :: Enhances mana regeneraation\n\n arcantic alacrity :: Speeds up spell casting, even for offensive spells.\n arcantic lethargy :: Slows down spell casting for your enemies.\n\n Note that arcantic alacrity's affect will stack with spellcraft, \n making Warlocks and Witches the fastest spell casters in the \n realm.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF THORNS'~\nThis spell, available to Druids and Elementalists, causes attackers to\ntake a small amount of damage when attacking you.  The spell has a \nlong casting delay and large mana cost, and a comparatively short\nduration.  It may be cast on anybody.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF BRAMBLES'~\nThis spell, available to Druids and Elementalists, causes attackers to\ntake a moderate amount of damage when they land attacks on you.  It\ndoes slightly more damage than 'shield of thorns', and also has a high\nmana cost, long delay, and brief duration.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF SPIKES'~\nSister spell to 'shield of thorns' and 'shield of brambles', this spell\nhas a long casting time, high mana cost, and short duration.  It does,\nhowever, do a significant amount of damage to attackers who land their\nhits on you.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF BLADES'~\nThe last spell in the damage shield line, shield of blades is available\nonly to Druids and Elementalists, and does a severe amount of damage \nto the source of a melee attack that hits the caster.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF BEAR'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, boosts the target's\nStrength.  It can be cast on anybody, even while in combat.  It also\nboosts the target's damage output by a set ratio.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF CAT'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, boosts the target's\nDexterity.  It can be cast on anybody, even while in combat.  It also\nboosts the target's chance of landing second, third, and off-hand \nattacks.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF BOAR'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, boosts the target's\nConstitution.  It can be cast on anybody, even while in combat.  It also\nboosts the target's damage resistance.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF OWL'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, boosts the target's\nWisdom.  It can be cast on anybody, even while in combat.  It also\nboosts the target's experience gains while levelling.\n~\n\n0 'SPIRIT OF WOLF'~\nThis spell, castable only by Spirit Caller Druids, gives the target\na few extra attacks during melee.  If the target backstabs or kcharges\nwhile affected by Spirit of Wolf, they'll get a third attack, but the\nspell will fade immediately.  Otherwise, the spell gives a set number\nof extra attacks before fading.\n~\n\n\n0 'SPIRIT CALLER' 'SPIRITCALLER'~\n\nSpirit Callers are druids who are intensely in tune with the spirit\nworld around them.  As such, they have access to five spells relating\nto this ability.\n\n  Spirit of Boar, gives a constitution boost.\n  Spirit of Bear, gives a strength boost.\n  Spirit of Cat,  gives a dexterity boost.\n  Spirit of Owl,  gives a wisdom boost.\n  Spirit of Wolf, gives a combat boost.\n\n  All of the spirit spells cost some skill points, and very little \nmana.  They are also all cast very rapidly.\n\nThe spiritcaller kit is available to all races, all genders, but\nonly if they are druids.\n~\n\n0 'FENCE'~\nFences are the consumate sellers of goods.  They are real smooth \noperators, classy, mobster type slick guys.  They use the \nconnive skill in their trade.  Fences also know about the secret\nback rooms that most shopkeepers have.  This allows fences to\ntrade while invis or hidden.\nThis being said, the social stat is very important to them.\n\nSee also:  connive\n~\n0 'CONNIVE'~\nConnive is the skill used by a fence when selling goods.  It\nalso allows the fence to talk their way out of \"sticky\" \nsituations every now and then.\n\nSee also:  fence\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD BASH'~\nSyntax: shieldbash <Victim>\n\nAvailable to Warriors, Blademasters, Samurai, Paladins, Berzerkers.\n\nShield bash stuns your victim for 1 round, and makes spellcasting\nmore difficult for a brief period afterwards.\n~\n\n0 'SYMBOL'~\n\nThere are four Symbol spells.  They are available to clerics and\ncrusaders only.  Their whereabouts and purpose are unknown.\n\n~\n\n0 'HAMSTRING'~\nSyntax: hamstring <victim>\n\n  Hamstring is a specialized opening move for Rogues, Thieves, and\nAssassins.  Hamstring does not require any special weaponry, and it\ncan in fact be performed using only one's bare hands.  When successful,\nhamstring costs the victim moves, some DEXTERITY, and applies the slow\nflag.  Hamstring will also strip haste if it's there.  A hamstrung\nvictim will occassionally have trouble when moving from room to room.\nHaving high strength and constitution not only reduces this problem,\nbut helps to avoid getting hamstrung in the first place.  Hamstring's\nimpressive array of debilitative affects are countered by its short\nduration and the fact that it cannot be used in combat, meaning the\nthief must give up on an opening backstab to use this manuever.\n\n~\n\n0 'ACCLIMATE'~\nSyntax: c 'acclimate' <target>\n\n   Acclimate attunes the recipient to the ambient energy of his or her\nsurroundings, making him/her regenerate incredibly rapidly.  If the\nrecipient of this spell does *ANYTHING* or takes damage from almost\nany source, the spell will cancel.  The recipient must remain absolutely\nstill to receive the full affect.  Druids only may cast this spell.\nThe spell can only be acquired via spell pages.\n\nThe location of this spell page is unknown.\n~\n\n0 'RESEARCH'~\n\n   Research is the skill that mages uses to create new spell scrolls.\nThe higher the skill, the more likely the mage is to successfully\ncraft spell pages.  Research is given automatically to all Mages\nand Wizards.\n\n   Currently most spell research must be done at the public magelab\nin Midgaard, which has recently purchased a MageLab 2000 research kit.\n~\n\n0 'REGENERATION'~\nSyntax: cast 'regeneration' <target>\n\n    This is a restoration-over-time spell.  It lasts for about 4\nminutes and heals a small amount of hit points during that time.\nIt is available to clerics, crusaders, and any hybrids that could\nbe old class cleric.  This spell belongs to no group and must be\nfound on spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'CRITICAL HIT'~\n\n    Critical strikes are a feature that is only available to classes\nthat can be old class warriors.  These are Warrior, Blademaster, Samurai\nBerserker, and Paladin.  If you are one of these classes and you are\noldclass Warrior, you will automatically receive critical strikes.  They\ndo extra damage based on your level.\n\n   If you are not an oldclass warrior but are one of these classes, you\ncan buy the ability to have critical hits by taking the 'enhanced \ncritical' skill.  This will give you critical hitting ability akin to\na warrior's inate ability.  For warriors, this will improve your chance\nof landing a critical hit.  For all characters with 'critical strike'\nthe damage curve is softened slightly.\n\n  Two other specialized crits are available.  'Bludgeoning' works with\nbash weapons, and 'Cleave' works with slashing weapons.  Both give an\nadditional chance to land a critical strike.\n\n  Note that you don't have to take enhanced critical to use cleave or\nbludgeoning.  \n\n Example:\tCleric Paladin\n\tHas no natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit', he\nhas basic crit ability with a soft curve.  If he takes 'cleave', he\nhas better crit chance with slashing weapons, and regular crit chance\nwith all others, and a softer curve.\n\n Example:\tBlademaster\n\tHas natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit' he has\nbetter chance to land a crit plus a softer curve.  If he takes 'cleave',\nhe gets a REALLY good chance to crit with slashers, improved chance to\ncrit with everything else, and soft damage curve.\n~\n\n0 'ENHANCED CRITICAL' 'CLEAVE' 'BLUDGEON'~\nSee 'CRITICAL HIT'.\n~\n\n0 'SUNBURST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sunburst' <target>\n\n    Sunburst is a single-target offensive spell.  It deals LIGHT damage,\nnot fire, and as such it has the potential to blind the victim from the\nintense light.  Sunburst does slightly less damage than the spell 'acid\nblast,' which is part of the basic training of most Boingan mages.\n\n   The origins of the Sunburst spell are unknown.  Researchers have\ndetermined that it is probably usable by Wizards, Mages, and Druids.\n~\n\n0 'SONIC BLAST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sonic blast' <target>\n\n    Sonic Blast emits a wall of mechanic waves that slam into a target in\na concentrated force, snapping bones and causing pain.  Sonic blast does\nslightly less damage than the standard Boingan spell 'acid blast'.   It\nhas the potential to stun the victim for 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of\ncombat.\n\n    Nobody knows where this spell comes from.  A leading researching at\nthe New Thalos academy of magic has suggested that a renegade mage may\nhave escaped into Altirin and developed the spell there.\n~\n\n0 'ADAMANTITE SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'adamantite skin'\n \n    Available to Mages and Wizards only, 'adamantite skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as adamantite.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.  The pages must be researched at the public mage\nlab.  The formula for the adamantite page can be found at the same \nlocation as one of the ingredients.\n~\n\n0 'INCINERATE'~\nSyntax: cast 'incinerate' <victim>\n\n    Incinerate is identicle to the 'acid blast' spell, except it does\nfire-based damage.  Incinerate is available to mages and wizards only.\nIt must be researched at the mage's guild in Midgaard.  The formula\nto create the spell scroll can be found at the magelab.\n~\n\n0 'STEEL SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'steel skin'\n\n\tAvailable to Mages and Wizards only, 'steel skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as steel.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'DIAMOND SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'diamond skin'\n\n\tDiamond skin is available to Mages and Wizards only.  It\ntransforms the flesh of the caster to a diamond-like substance\ncapable of repelling all damage.  Each attack lowers the duration of\nthe affect until eventually it fades completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF FAITH'~\nSyntax: cast 'shield of faith'\n\n   This self-only spell is available to Clerics, Crusaders, Paladins,\nDruids, and Monks.  A shimmering shield of protection is draped over\nthe shoulders of the caster by his/her deity.  The shield will absorb\nthe next several attempts to injure the caster.  The number of attacks\nit absorbs depends on the casting level of the caster.\n\n    This spell belongs to no spell group.  It may only be learned via\nspell pages and the Ritual.\n~\n\n0 RITUAL~\nSyntax: ritual\n \n   The Ritual is a rite by which religious classes learn new spells.\n To perform the ritual, the caster must be holding a spell page that\n has a copy of the spell he wants to learn, and be in an Altar room.\n The better the Altar, the better the chance of the Ritual being \n successful.  Four main factors influence the success of the Ritual.\n A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Level help the caster perform\n the Ritual properly.  But the inherent complexity of the scroll makes\n it more difficult.  \n\n If the Ritual is successful, the caster will receive the spell in his\n 'practice' and 'spells' list, and it functions like a normal spell\n after that.  The scroll is no longer needed, and the caster will never\n lose the spell.  It can be practiced and used like any other spell.\n It does not belong to any spell group.\n\n The caster must meet a level requirement for using the scroll, which\n is generally far lower than the actual level of the spell.  Whether\n or not the Ritual works, the scroll will lose 1 use.  Most scrolls have\n only 1 use, but some lesser scrolls may have more.\n\n The Ritual only works for oldclass clerics.  Oldclass mages will have\n to use study command.\n~\n\n0 STUDY~\nSyntax:  study <scroll name>\n\nThis command only works if your oldclass is mage.  It does one thing:  \ncopy a spellpage.\n\nIf the study attempt  is successful, the caster will receive the spell \nin their 'practice' and 'spells' list.  Once you have enscribed it, the\nthe spellpage is no longer needed.  The learned spell can be practiced\nand used like any other spell.  It does not belong to any spell group.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, 'spell pages'\n\n~\n0 'SPELL PAGES'~\nSpell pages are special scrolls that are found throughout the land of\nBoinga.  They enable an oldclass mage or cleric to learn a new scroll\nwithout having to gain the scroll from a Guildmaster.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, study\n\n~\n0 'REMOVE DISEASE'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove disease' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It \nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Disease is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks disease-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on plague or other non-DOT disease spells.  Remove Disease will weaken\nthe DOT.

It may require several castings before Remove Poison gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 SURNAME~\nSyntax:\tsurname <name>\n\n  Characters who have reached level 35 may select a surname.  This name\n  must conform to the same rules as first names.  You may have the same\n  surname as another character if you wish.  Nobody owns a surname, and\n  nobody has to have your permission to use yours.  Surnames can only be\n  changed by an IMMORTAL once set.  This is not normally done unless your\n  surname is inappropriate, or your character gets married and wishes to\n  take the surname of his or her spouse.  Surnames are only displayed in\n  your score and the who list,  and serve no purpose but for roleplaying \n  and fun.\n\n  You can toggle whether or not you see surnames in the who list by \n  using \"brief surname.\"\n\n~\n\n0 PREFRESH PFRESH~\n\nQ: What exactly is this prefresh I keep hearing about?\n\nA: Over the course of the almost 6 years MHS has been around, characters\n   have levelled under many different systems of gains.  In an effort to\n   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters\n   to \"refresh\" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that\n   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will\n   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years\n   and put everyone on a level playing field.\n\nQ: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?\n\nA: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you \n   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken\n   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all\n   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish\n   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation\n   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you\n   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.\n   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,\n   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.\n   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if\n   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal\n   creation.\n\nQ: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What\n   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after\n   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?\n\nA: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are\n   being discussed include giving out \"xp vouchers\" for the left over xp,\n   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally\n   decided, the answer will be posted here.\n\nQ: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?\n\nA: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through\n   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this\n   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc\n   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using\n   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can\n   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so \n   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.\n\nQ: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,\n   what good are they?\n\nA: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to \n   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you\n   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will\n   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices\n   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.\n\nQ: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.\n\nA: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending\n   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can\n   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills\n   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new\n   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that\n   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be\n   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it\n   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if\n   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.\n\nQ: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?\n\nA: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take\n   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the \n   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.\n\nQ: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my\n   practice sessions that way?\n\nA: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain\n   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up \n   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your\n   practice sessions.\n\nQ: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and\n   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?\n\nA: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your\n   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal\n   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,\n   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find\n   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.\n\nQ: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?\n\nA: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair \n   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all \n   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a \"stock\"\n   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly\n   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special\n   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special\n   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted\n   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of\n   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will\n   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.\n\nQ: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?\n\nA: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing\n   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we\n   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you\n   chose to change races.\n\nQ: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available\n   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?\n\nA: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and\n   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for\n   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes\n   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an \"old class\".\n   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level\n   and a few other things like delays on skills.\n\nQ: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?\n\nA: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the\n   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5\n   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,\n   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're\n   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will\n   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort\n   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.\n   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more\n   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be \n   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.\n\nQ: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want\n   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan\n   system?\n\n   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can \n   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be \n   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used\n   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader\n   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change\n   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,\n   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan\n   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).\n\nQ: What about my Mutant characters?\n\nA: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,\n   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not \n   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain\n   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once\n   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to\n   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you\n   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.\n\nQ: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I\n   think of something not covered in this help file?\n\nA: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had\n   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be \n   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that\n   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially\n   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding\n   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an\n   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either\n   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the \n   Admins.\n\nFINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of \n            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note\n\t    to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.  He'll consider\n\t    adding in your question if it hasn't already been answered.\n\n\n~\n\n0 MYRMIDON~\n\nMyrmidon\nConcept - The ultimate campaigner, the myrmidon is a classic soldier.\nThe military life is law to this kit.  Myrmidons live and die for the\nmartial life.  As a result of their rigid adherence to law and order,\nand the chain of command they tend to be strict and inflexible.\nHowever, the myrmidon is also highly trained in standard combat\nand is a skilled and powerful fighter.\n\nBenefits: \n* Specialization is free.  If the myrmidon has a specialization already\nwhen he picks up the kit, he'll be refunded the trains for it.\n* Because of their extensive training in basic combat prowess,\nmyrmidons, when using their specialized weapon, receive second\nand third attacks more often, anywhere from 125% to 150% depending\non the weapon skill percent and the myrmidon's level.\n* Also because of their extensive training, myrmidons receive a\nfourth attack skill.  With 100% in his/her specialized weapon\nand level 51, the myrmidon receives second attacks 75% of the\ntime, third attacks 50% of the time, and fourth attacks 25% of\nthe time.  These only apply with the specialized weapons.\n\nDrawbacks:\n* Because of their regimented martial life, these soldiers are less\nfamiliar with other fighting styles than their own.  As a result, they\nfight at a slight penalty when going up against creatures of a different\nsize (though not of a difference race if the race is the same size).\nThis penalty decreases as the myrmidon levels.\n\n~\n\n0 SPECIALIZE SPECIALIZATION~\nSyntax: specialize <weapon>\n\tspecialize help (displays this help file and costs)\n\nSpecialization is an option available to warriors and warrior reclasses\nSpecialization offers the warrior a better hitroll, more damage, and a\nremote shot at an extra attack.  Warriors and Blademasters may specialize in\nanything.  The warrior reclasses may specialize as follows:\n \n Samurai: sword, polearm, dagger\n Berzerker: sword, mace, axe\n Paladin: sword, flail, mace\n\nNote: In order to specialize, your oldclass must be warrior. IE a cleric\n      paladin cannot specialize, but a warrior paladin can.\n\n ~\n0 PAB 'PLAYER ADVISORY BOARD'~\nThe player advisory board (PAB) is an outlet for the coders to receive feedback about the major concerns for the game. Issues and suggestions brought forth by the PAB do not have to be implemented at all. Keep that in mind.\n\nEach clan will have 1 member on the board, usually the clan leader, but it can be anyone the clan decides to represent them. Clans can call for a change of representation at any time if the motion is supported by 3 different people, not characters. There will be 3 non-clanner positions on the board. Non-clanners will be appointed to the board by the immortal in charge of the PAB after having applied. These positions will be reviewed and possibly rotated on a monthly basis. Members of the player advisory board will receive an extra (PAB) flag by their name and be able to read notes posted to PAB. This will allow the other players to know who to talk to with their concerns. Being a member of the board is not something to be taken lightly, you will be required to post notes, attend meetings, and talk to the player base quite often.\n\nMeetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis. All other correspondence between the PAB will be through notes to all members, or through tells in order to come up with a working note to post. All members of the player advisory board will have their opinions considered, however the most popular idea will be the one that is sent on to the coders. Any questions about the PAB or its function will be answered by the immortal in charge of it at the time. No one else on the imm team is to be contacted concerning the PAB.\n\nImm currently in charge of the PAB: Hobkin\n\nMortals on the PAB have the PAB flag next to their names.\n\n\n~\n\n0 PYROTECHNICS~\n\nThe pyrotechnics spell group involves the creation of explosive materials.\nIts use is currently limited to samurai, monks and assassins. The spells \nare very powerful.\n\nsmall bomb: a small explosive device explodes on the target\nhigh explosive: blasts opponents with a larger bomb\nsmoke screen: obscures vision and allows an escape from combat\n\n**NOTE: Only Monks,Assassins and Samurai's get Smoke Screen **\n~\n\n0 NETHERMANCER NETHERMANCY FADE~\n\n   The Nethermancer is the most mysterious and unpredictable of spellcasters.\nThrough the art of {Cnethermancer{x, this kit can transfer hp to mana and vice\nversa as needed, at an exchange rate of 2::1.  This conversion is automatic.\nA perfect Nethermancer can only be destroyed when both his hit points and mana\nreach 0.  The Nethermancer also has a unique and uncontrollable ability to \nbecome completely invisible at will.  He cannot control when this happens and\nwhen it ceases, though he can force himself to become visible by engaging in\ncombat.  Nethermancers refer to this skill/annoyance as the {Cfade{x.  Finally,\nthe Nethermancer can bestow upon any weapon a special type of enchantment,\ncalled the nether flag.  What this does, nobody knows, and how the Nethermancer\nmanages to do it, nobody knows that either.  Nethermancers are automatically\noutfitted with a set of special robes.  If they lose their robes, they may use\nthe \"outfit\" command to get another set.  \n\nNethermancers cannot wear armor.\nArmor is defined as any item whose item type is armor.\n~\n\n0 BLADESINGER BLADESONG~\n\nSyntax: Bladesong\n        Bladesong stop\n\n   The Bladesinger is a special type of elf combatant.  Through the use of the\n{Cbladesong{x skill, the elven bladesinger receives a variety of bonuses in\ncombat, as well as up to a 25% chance for an extra attack during each combat\nround.  Bladesong can only be performed with a sword or dagger, and cannot be\nused if the bladesinger is wearing a shield.\n\n   Bladesong stop will end your deadly dance with the blades.\n~\n\n0 BATTLERAGER 'KILLING RAGE'~\n\n  The Battleragers are the elite corps of dwarven warriors.  Ragers are \nunstable at best, flying into insane fits of intense rage.  They can actually\ninflate their own hit points through the use of the {Ckilling rage{x, as well\nas receive a variety of other combat bonuses, including a chance at an extra\nattack during each combat round.  Battleragers can only perform the {Crage{x\nwhen wielding an axe, and cannot see their own hit point count while affected\nby the rage.\n~\n\n0 DAETOK~\n  Syntax: daetok\n\n  Dae'Tok is a Yinnish fighting style that cannot be learned by any other race.\nIt involves a style of trainin that Yinn are taught from childhood, and results\nin spectacular accuracy and maximum potential for damage with any form of \nweapon.  All Yinn become better with this skill as they advance in their\ncareers.  Dae'tok increases both the hitroll and damroll, and increases the\nchances of landing {Csecond{x and {Cthird{x attacks.\n\n~\n\n0 RANGERS~\n\n  The ranger is a master of the wilderness.  As such, (s)he fights most\neffectively in nature - plains, forests, hills and mountains, and is\nuncomfortable and ill-at-ease when indoors or in urban areas.  All rangers\nmay declare a species enemy (see {cSPECIES ENEMY{x), and will receive bonuses\nwhen fighting against any player or creature of that species.  The ranger's\ndislike of his/her species enemy is so strong that those creatures are \npenalized in defensive skills when defending against the ranger.  Rangers may\nmove from any sector to any sector for one movement point, and receive +3 \nmoves when they level.  They also may dual wield with any combination of\nweapon types.\n\nNOTE:  When the material table is complete, Rangers will be forbidden from\nwearing armor made from non-natural materials.  This means they'll be \nrestricted to leathers, cloth, wood, and the like.\n~\n\n0 'SPECIES ENEMY'~\nSyntax: species <race>\n\n   Rangers do not have to declare a species enemy, but the cost of this \nfeature is included with the price of the kits, they pay for it whether they\nuse it or not.  The species enemy must be a PC race.  Once you pick one, you\ncan never -ever- change it.  Select wisely.  Rangers fight remarkably well\nwhen going up against their species enemy, and members of that race don't\ndefend as well against the ranger.  You may not declare your own race as your\nspecies enemy.\n~\n\n0 'TUTINDEX'~\n\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n GETTING STARTED        Introduction to MHS\n TUT2\t\t\tPractices and Trains\n TUT3\t\t\tLevels and Rules Changes\n\n~\n\n0 'GETTING STARTED'~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n   Moosehead SLED is based on ROM2.3, so if you've ever played a ROM MUD,\nmany of these elements will be familiar to you.  If you are new to MHS or\nmudding, this file is designed to help you get started.  One of the first\nthings you will want to do is familiarize yourself with the commands.  The\n\"score\" command contains most of the relevent information about your character.\nThe \"worth\" and \"attrib\" commands show your gold/silver line and attributes\nlines seperately.  The \"who\" command lists all the characters that are logged\nin right now (that you can see).  Type \"equipment\" to see what gear your\ncharacter is currently wearing.  The \"inventory\" command lists the things that\nhave on you but are not currently using.  We recommend that you go through\nthe newbie school (type {crecall{x, {cup{x, {cnorth{x to get there) to get\na good head stat. \n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut2'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT2~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 2 \n\nTRAINS and PRACTICES\n   Your character improves by killing beasties and getting experience.  By\ngaining experience you eventually gain levels, which allow you to learn and\nuse new skills, spells, and abilities.  All new skills that you learn will\nbegin at 1% (except recall and scan, which start at 50%).  Although your skills\nwill naturally improve with use, you have to jump-start them by practicing\nthem.  A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will\neventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which\nthis happens is generally very low at low levels.  To practice a skill, you\nneed to locate a trainer (there is one in the Newbie school, follow the\nsigns to find him).  After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your\nclass to practice skills.  To practice a skill, you need to have at least 1\n{Gpractice{x session available (type {Cpractice{x to see how many you have).\nSimply type: {Cpractice <skill_name>{x, where <skill_name> is the skill\nthat you wish to practice.  Do not use quotes.  The skill you selected will\nincrease by a few percentage points.  The higher your {YINT{x is when you\npractice, the more your skills will increase with each {Gpractice{x session.\nThe highest a skill can go with manually practicing is 75%.  For anything\nbeyond that, you'll just have to use the skill and let it improve naturally.\nYou begin with 5 {Gpractices{x and you receive from 1 to 5 more every time\nyou level.  The higher your {YWIS{x is when you level, the more {Gpractice{x\nsessions you receive.\n\n   Your character also has 5 primary {Yattributes{x that summarize his or her\nabilities.  They are: {Ystrength{x, {Ydexterity{x, {Yintelligence{x, \n{Ywisdom{x, {and {Yconstitution{x.  See the individual help files for each \nfor detailed information on how they affect your character.  {YAttributes{x\nstart at a specific value depending on what race and class you selected. To\nimprove your attributes, you use a {Gtraining{x session.  You begin with 3\n{Gtrains{x and after that, you receive 1 more every time you level.  Your\n{Yattributes{x range from 3 to 25, and usually start out between 10 and 15.\nYou will want to train your {YCON{x and {YWIS{x first.  This action also\nrequires a trainer.  There is one in the newbie school.  These trainers are\nnot always the same as the {Gpractice{x trainers.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut3'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT3~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 3\n\nLEVELS and RULES CHANGES\n \n   As your character levels up, some of the game rules will change.  Also,\nyou'll be gradually forced to explore more the game world.  At level 6, you\nwill nol onger be able to enter newbie school, and must locate trainers in \nthe world somewhere.  Your character does not have to worry about the size of\nhis/her armor until level 11, and is able to use the {Crecall{x skill at will\nuntil level 11 as well.  After that, recalling requires the use of deity gifts\n(see {chelp deity{x), spells, or magic items.  The game will warn you about \nthese changes as you approach level 11.\n\n   When you level, it is in your best interests to wear what is called\n\"levelling gear.\"  Anything can technically be \"levelling gear\", but this\nterm generally refers to equipment that people only wear when they are about\nto level.  Usually this equipment gives you bonuses to your {YCON{x, {YWIS{x,\nand {YINT{x (see the helpfiles for each attribute for more information).\nWhere do you find levelling gear?  Ask around and explore, that is your best\nbet.  Note that when you level, the amount of experience that you need to \nreach the next level doesn't change.  Rather, you begin to gradually get less\nexperience for the same monsters.  You'll need to explore and find new monsters\nto slaughter that are more of a challenge.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut4'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 SPELLCRAFT~\n\n   Spellcraft is a special skill in which the spellcaster has studied\nthe metaphysics of spellcasting.  Those skilled with spellcraft are able\nto identify which spells other are casting, whether they are of the same class\nor not.  They also suffer a smaller mana drain when they loose concentration,\ncan sometimes cast a +1 over their normal casting level.  Spellcraft has a\nvariety of other, more subtle effects that make for a more solid \nspellcasting character.  This skill is incredibly difficult to increase.\n~\n\n0 BANKS BANKING DEPOSIT WITHDRAW~\nSyntax: deposit <#>\n        withdraw <#>\n\n   There is one banker in Midgaard, his name is Otho, he can be\nfound on clan road.  You may only deposit eggs into the bank, and they\nmust be in your inventory for you to do it.  Your total number of eggs\nin the bank is listed in your score.  You do not collect interest and \nthere is no minimum balance.  Your eggs are completely safe in the bank.\nNotice that unsavory individuals may hang around and attempt to steal your\neggs when you go to deposit/withdraw them.  The bank is not responsible \nfor stolen eggs.  \n\n~\n\n0 COLOR COLOUR~\n\n   Syntax based on Lope's standard colour code.\n\n   To enable color, type \"color on\".  To disable, type \"color off\".\n\n   This SLED automatically colorizes some elements of the game.  If you do\nnot like our colors, do not turn color on.  If you want to use only a few\nparts of color, get a client and utilize its color features.\n\n   You may use the following in any place to create color; notes, titles,\ntells, channel use, any where.  Please note that if you do not reset the\ncolor to 'normal', your color will bleed.

When you are trading, the money\nand items are removed from your inventory and held in memory.  If you remove\nthe items/money from the trade, leave the room, or cancel/clear the trade,\nyou get them back.  If you approve the trade, they go over to the other\nperson and are no longer yours.  When you are happy with the trade, type\n\"trade approve\" to finalize it.  BOTH traders must type \"trade approve\"\nfor it to work.  If anybody changes the trade, by either adding to it or\nremoving stuff from it, both people must type \"trade approve\" again.\n~\n\n-1 WIZLIST~\n\n        ________      ===============================      ________\n      /+_+_+_+_+_\\    |    The Gods of Moosehead    |    /+_+_+_+_+_\\\n      \\__________/    ===============================    \\__________/\n        |::XXXX|                                           |XXXX::|\n        |X::XXX|              Creator / IMP                |:XXXX:|\n        |XX::XX|               -----------                 |::XXXX|\n\t|XXX::X|        Rusty, The Oxidizing Dragon        |X::XXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|            Benefactor / Coder             |:XXXX:|\n        |XXXX::|               -----------                 |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|       Boogums \"BooglyDude\" McDugal        |::XXXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |:XXXX:|                                           |XXXX::|\n/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\                           /<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\\n\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/       Immortals           \\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\n       |.  /\\ . |            ---------------              |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Alagaster                 | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |               BriarRose  - ADMIN        |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |               KallaLilly                |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Karag                     | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|               Kuno - ADMIN              | . /\\  .|\n       | .//\\.  |               Slodhian - ADMIN          | .//\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       |.  /\\  .|                                         |.  /\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | .//\\  .|     Long live the memory of Mandrake    | .//\\  .|\n        \\. /\\  /         who left before his time.         \\. /\\  /\n         \\ /\\ /    [ IMMORTAL ] Grey Kellam : Mandrake      \\ /\\ /\n          \\/\\/                                               \\/\\/\n           \\/                                                 \\/\nArt by Blackstaff and Sara\n\nLast Updated By Boogums - 30NOV03\n~\n-1 HERO HEROES~\nThe list that follows is that of those who have attained the\nlevel of 52.

Here, anyone of level 52\nor higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the\nusual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;\nexamples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to\ncreation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,\nability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote\nplayers to immortality.\n\nSince immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)\na carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal\nbehavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without\nexplicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please\ndon't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or\nyou'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to\nthis file.\n\nThe duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,\nare topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are\nfraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)\n~\n\n-1 SOCIALS~\n \nThis is a complete list of socials for Moosehead SLED:\nCompiled originally by: Sara\naccuse       adjust      air          apologize     applaud     babble\nbark         bcatch      beckon       beer          bearhug     beg\nbird         bkiss       bleed        blink         blush       boast\nboggle       bonk        bounce       bow           brb         burp\ncackle       caress      charge       cheer         chuckle     clap\nclaw         collapse    comfort      comb          cough       cover\ncower        cringe      criticize    cry           cuddle      curse\ncurtsey      dance       daydream     drool         duck        embrace\nexplode      eyebrow     faint        fart          flare       flash\nflex         flinch      flip         flirt         flutter     fondle\nfrench       frown       fume         gasp          giggle      glare\ngoose        grimace     grin         groan         grope       grovel\ngrowl        grumble     hand         head          hiccup      highfive\nhop          howl        hug          hush          ignore      innocent\ninsane       judge       kiss         knee          laugh       lick\nlove         lust        massage      meditate      moan        moon\nmosh         mutter      nibble       nod           nudge       nuzzle\npant         passout     pat          peck          pie         pinch\npissed       plead       point        poke          ponder      pout\npray         propose     puke         punch         purr        ramble\nraspberry    rofl        roll         rub           ruffle      run\nscratch      scream      serenade     shake         shiver      shrug\nsigh         sing        slap         slobber       smile       smirk\nsnap         snarl       sneeze       snicker       sniff       snore\nsnort        snowball    snuggle      sob           spam        spank\nspit         squeal      squeeze      squirm        stare       stretch\nstrip        stroke      strut        sulk          swoon       tackle\ntease        thank       threaten     tickle        tip         tongue\ntwiddle      type        undress      view          wave        whine\nwhistle      wiggle      wince        wink          wonder      worry\nworship      yawn        yeehaw       yodel         rose\tlaces\ntank\t     starve\t aargh\t      homework\t    puff\tdiffer\nyae\t     lightbulb   voodoo       ogg\t    confused\tbeam\nbite\t     discodance  scuff        whap\t    lag\t\tchortle\nzerbert      twitch      roxbury\n \n~\n\n-1 MERC~\nThis sled is based on Merc 2.1, created by Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn.  \nMerc 2.1 is available as Merc_21.tar.gz from ftp.tcp.com and \nftp.math.okstate.edu.\nE-mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com' to join the merc mailing list.\n\nThanks to ...\n  ...

Their universal greed is the strongest bond between\nany of the existing clanners.\n  \nAvarice is a highly selective clan, who tends to keep its numbers\nlow.  The exclusivity is derived from the clan's lack of trust in\noutsiders, and a desire to have a large market that can be used\nin amassing great wealth in the name of the Avarice clan.\n   \nEntrance Requirements:\n -Must be level 20+\n -Must have the steal skill (above 75%)\n    \nAvarice's great power and wealth must be protected at all costs.  In order\nto ensure that only loyal members to the cause of Avarice are gulded, expect\ntests of your abilities and quests to prove your faithfulness if you\nchoose to join the ranks of Avarice.\n\nAvarice Charter (rules)\n    \n -You MAY attack anyone of a thief-based reclass (thief, rogue, assassin,\n  berzerker, monk)\n -You may NOT attack anyone who is not a thief-based reclass.\n  EXCEPTION:  You are allowed to attack to aid a clanmate who has\n    been attacked.  Note that this doesn't mean you can attack your\n    clanmate, but you may attack anyone who is attacking them.\n -You do NOT group with those outside of your clan EVER. \n -You do NOT help those outside of your clan for free.\n -Read those again.  Avarice does not trust outsiders be they clanners\n  or non-clanners.  You may sell items and services, as this is part \n  of your clan ideals.  But you are not Matookers or Honor.\n -There will be no alliances with any clans.\n\nSee 'help avarice sanction' for sanctioning information.\n\nAvarice is not a sin, it's a way of life...\n~\n\n-1 HONOR~\nIt is a time of ideals,\nof leaders, of followers,\nof love, of friendship,\nof life, of death, of truth...\nof HONOR!!\n\nWe are truly now the new generation of HONOR clansmen and women.\nOur forefathers began the quest for justice and truth a millennia ago, \non the plains of Northern Midgaard.

He was travelling the land and noticed that\nthere was power in the magical arts that was far beyond his or any others'\ncomprehension. He decided from that day forth to unite all pure spellcasters\nso as to fully understand and improve upon the arts of magic. He and his\nfaithful followers travelled the lands of Boinga to search out all those that\nhad the pure blood of magic in their veins. Those who would not join him and\nhis brethren were made to pay with their lives.\n\nHere we are left but a few proud spellcasters who have survived the trials\nof time. Now we shall rise again amongst the ashes of our ancestors. In our\nplight to truly unite the purity of magic, we have been forced to divide\ninto three sects.\n\nThose who adorn the White Robes of Warlock show the purity of magic through\nkindness. Their role in our clan is to guide all young spellcasters to gain\nknowledge of the magical arts.\n\nThose who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.\n\nThose who adorn the Black Robes of Warlock use the darker side of magic to\npunish the renegades who chose not to follow the true path, and defend our\nclan against those who would wage war. \n\nOur goals of the unity of pure magic has made us a very diverse clan, and for\nall those interested you may speak with any member of our clan and they will\nput you in touch with our recruitment officers.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements:\n  \n* You must be a pure spellcaster\n  (mage, cleric, elementalist, druid, wizard, crusader)\n   \nWarlock Charter (rules)\n*  You may not group with any clanner who is a:\n   Mage, Cleric, Elementalist, Druid, Wizard, or Crusader\n   They abuse the art and are to be killed on site.\n\n*  You may group with / help any nonclanner.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 RONOH~\n.\"It is a time of ideals,\n of leaders, of followers,\n of love, of friendship,\n of life, of death...\n of Honor.\"\n\nWE are the new generation of Honor clansmen and women.  Our forefathers\nbegan the quest for justice a millennia ago, on the plains of Northern\nMidgaard.  Blood and tears were shed to regain honor once lost.  In the end,\nClan Honor's strength in numbers allowed for victory, but at a great cost\nin lives.  The evil were caught, drawn, quartered, and hung.  They remain\nthere even today, as a reminder of the folly in betrayal, and the swift hand\nof vengeance.\n \nCLAN Honor's ideals come from the very heart of it's members.

You will also be responsible for petitioning a Knight, \nEarl, or Lord to give you a quest.

They were a peacefull kind, only wishing to keep their \nrace going, raising cattle, and growing crops.  But as outsiders came to \nthe lands of the Goblins and tried to take over their farmland, it became \nobvious they would need some kind of defense, an army of some sort to fend \noff the newcommers.  And so was formed the Legion.\n\nThe Legion has one reason for being, and that is to keep the Goblins alive.\nIf you are a Goblin, and want to stand up for yourself in this world of\nraces far bigger then the Goblins, then the Legion is the place for you.\nThe Legion does not wish to seek out battle, we just wish to defend ourselves.\nAny race can join the Legion, but only a Goblin can ever hope to become\nanything more then just a guardsman.\n\nIf you wish to join the Legion, to help the Goblin race survive, you must\ncontact one of the leaders, or a recruiter, in a note or when you meet one\non-line. You must be able to roleplay, because the Legion is a clan formed \naround roleplaying and it is imperitive that you can do so to join this clan. \nIf you are a non-goblin then you may have to prove yourself worthy of \nprotecting the Goblins, because it would be a horrible thing if we recruited \nthe weak for this task.\n\nLONG LIVE THE LEGION!\n~\n\n-1 ELCRIC~\nThe Clan Circle\n\n    \"As one I am weak, but as many we are strong.

It is magic that drives\nus, and it is in magic that we find true power.  This is the founding belief\nof clan Circle.  Through magic, any problem can be solved, any obstacle over-\ncome.  The main goal of Circle is to encourage and foster the development\nand increased use of magic, through the use of our own magic, power, and\nstrength.\n\n    The members of Clan Circle reside in the Tower, a massive building in \nwhich we work our spells.  Members of Circle receive free spell-ups, enchants,\ncorpse retrievals, and all of the other benefits that one would expect from a\nclan.  Although all clan members are expected to be willing to help others,\nthe Mentors of Circle are dedicated to this task.  The Guardians of Circle \nare the clan's military force, ready to fight at a moment's notice, and\nwilling to sacrafice their lives in defense of our ideals, members, and magic.\n\n    Roleplaying is *not* required to join Circle.  The only roleplaying\nthat is asked of all members is that you keep your characters seperate, as per\nthe basic \"no multiplaying\" rule of MHS.  We do encourage members to roleplay\nand develop their characters, but we do not require it.  Tithing of income\nis also encouraged but not required.\n\nCircle Leadership and Law\n\n    Circle is overseen by the Conclave, a council of 7 leaders who are\nelected or appointed from the clan.  There are very few defined rules in \nCircle.  We are a clan, we are Magi, we are family.  All members of Circle\nare given as much personal freedom as possible, and in return, we expect \nthat all members take responsibility for their actions, words, and beliefs.\n\nJoining Circle\n\n    Any race or class can join Circle.  Although our specialty is magic,\nand we generally only actively recruit mages and clerics, warriors and thieves\nare welcome to apply for admission.\n\n    The is only one requirement to join Circle.  Mages and Clerics must\nhave at least 8 spell groups, and Warriors and Thieves must have at least 3.\nBecause dragons are very difficult and timely to advance, the draconian spells\nare considered a spell group for the purpose of meeting this requirement.\n\n    If you wish to join Circle, talk to a Recruiter.  Any Inner Circle\nor Outer Circle is also a Recruiter.  If no recruiter is available, then post\na note to Circle, informing us of your race, class, and current level.  All\napplicants will be given a thorough interview, and some will be asked to \ncomplete a quest.\n\n                                  - Clan Circle, Never Ending, Ever Lasting\n~\n\n-1 LONER~\nLoners are individualists, standing alone from any Clan, but subject\nto the same rules as clanners with respect to pkilling, pstealing,\nand transportation spells.  By definition, Loners have no common\nhall, no leaders, and no affiliation among each other, save what they\nagree upon for themselves.\n\nTo become a Loner simply issue the 'loner' command between levels 5\nand 20.  This command -cannot- be reversed under any circumstance.\nDo it carefully.\n~\n\n-1 ECNALAB~\nIn life there are those who take, those who give, those who lead and\nthose who follow.  Seldom are they one and the same, but this is the\nland of Boinga, the land where the beautiful princess Alia once\nstepped. She had a vision, a vision of a family where to lead and to\nfollow to give and to take were equally respected by all who were\npart of the family of BALANCE.\n\nIn the days when Alia walked among us we were happy, at peace and\nable to console ourselves that we were no-one's master and no-one's\nslave. But Alia left this realm and chaos ensued. We strived to\nbecome what she had taught us and when we achieved it she did walk\namong us again.  Dissention was rife and soon after her visitation\nBalance fell under internal turmoil and deceit; the few feeling\nthat they took precedence over the many...\n\nAnd so this continued until one day few were left. They decided\nto make their own way and live the teachings of Alia rather than\nfollow them, throwing scorn on the likes of Riders those who would\nhave sheep rather than friends.\n\nWith that Balance was reborn!\n\nBalance is a family of members, none being any more important than\nany other. We strive for total equality and are in a constant\nstate of war with Riders, who see some fit to be ranked far above\nothers.  To join Balance just speak to any full member and they\nwill give you an interview (or arrange one for later). A full member\nis one who has been in the clan for 6 levels (or 20 days at 51). This\nis so new members have time to learn the ways of Balance before \ncompleting entrance into our clan.\n\nThe Current Speaker of Balance is Rigger.\nThe speaker of Balance is the person who is elected to be the\nspokesperson to the outside world.\n~\n\n-1 ESIMED~\nChildren of Demise\n\n        Darkness swallows light, death extinguishes life, and hope is but a \nfoolish dream. All things must come to an end, and the Children of Demise\nfaithfully help the end come quicker. We willingly bear the burden of life,\nso we can help the unbelievers on into the everlasting darkness. To enter\nthe darkness serving the faith is the greatest priviledge. To crush all\nhope and happiness is one the many steps to our eventual success.\nI, Eiji, am the father of Demise. I have come forth from the shadows to bring\nthe words and wisdom of Demise. There is no stopping our tide. We shall \nprevail.\n\nClan Demise\n\n        Clan Demise consists of a cult with a inner hierarchy. You rank\nis based on your level, your acts in the name of Demise, and your Role-\nplaying. Clan Demise allows pking, pstealing, and other cruel activities.\nWe work together as a tight unit, planning carefully all ventures.\nIf thou wishest to join Demise, expect a serious questioning from members.\nThey tolerate no stupidity, foolhardiness, or insolence.\nROLE-PLAYING is a MUST.\n~\n\n-1 DEMISE~\nAbove, in the planes of the Deities lies one of true evil.  His power is fueled\nby destruction and vengeance that are channeled through the wrath of his \nglorious children!  We are the Children of Cthon!  Spawns of Hell, Delivers \nof Death, Vengeance and Chaos.  We are the elite army of the greatest \npower.  We bare the burden of life to crush all hope and extinguish all life, \nmaking Cthon ever so much stronger! \n\nThose within our ranks have the privilege of serving the greatest evil.  As such\nCthon himself grants the elite army with speed and aura of fear that makes \nour enemies cower in fear with our power!  Possessing so much power we \nharness it and war with every existing clan, loner and outcast.  No treaty or \nbond between clans is powerful enough to stop our storm,  for we come for \nyou?always. In the words of wisdom of Eiji, the father of Demise, \"There is no\nstopping our tide! We shall prevail!\"\n\nClan Demise\n\nTo enter Clan Demise is a feat in itself.  Do not come looking for us.  We \nwill come to you.  Show us your power by killing and looting.  Any attack \non you consider it a test.  You must also be a minimum of level 15, and  \neven then, when we feel you are ready you fill be asked to join and no \nsooner.\n\nClan Demise is a cult of inner hierarchy, in which your rank is on the basis\nof your level,  your acts in demise, and other cruel activities.  If you do not\nmaintain your power and skills you will be outcasted and hunted by your \nformer clan.  No stupidity, foolishness or insolence is allowed, and  \nrole-playing is a must.  \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You must have a Thug or Killer flag\n\nDemise Charter (rules)\n{YGROUPING{x or {YWORKING{x with anyone outside the clan is *expressly* \nforbidden! If they are in your range, kill them!!!\nYou may assist nonclanners as you see fit.\n\n~\n\n-1 ZEALOT~\nZealot....\n\n\"Blessed are we, the Children of the Almighty, for we will live to see His\neternal paradise brought upon Boinga.  Let us pray...\"\n\nThe words of the Almighty are spoken, and his children wake, and listen.\nThese children are known for their devotion to the Almighty, the one\ntrue God of Boinga. Teachers, Warriors, Healers, Sages, Young and old\nalike, they bind together under one holy creed. Seeking out the false\nfaiths and their unholy prophets, they continue steadfastly to cleanse\nthe lands of the evil that has spawned within the hearts of pagan\nmen.\n\nThese children of the Almighty, from all walks of life, are bound\nheart, mind, and soul to a common purpose, and a common name:\n\nZealot.\n\nThe faithful of the Almighty have but one purpose:  to annihilate the\nfalse faiths of the lands through any means necessary.\n\nNoone shall be considered neutral.  All will fall before the might of\nthe Almighty!\n\nEntrance Requirements:\nNone\n\nZealot Charter (rules)\nYou may not group with or work with any other clanners.  They all\nserve false gods.  You may work or group with nonclanners as \ntheir gods have already been conqured by the Almighty and they are\nonly humoring themselves.\n\n~\n-1 'ZEALOT RANKS'~\n----------------------------Ranking----------------------------\n\n/1 The Light of the Almighty. [*]\nThe members of the light are entrusted with the task of spreading\nthe teachings of the Almighty. They proclaim his holy glories to\nthe heathen nations, distribute holy scripture, heal and aid fellow\nbrethren in the congregation. They aid in the equipping and teaching\nof new recruits of the Almighty's Church. They may also aid in the\ncleansing of heathens or errant pledges, but this is not required.\nThey also aid the recruiters in bringing new recruits into the clan.\n\n/2 The Hand of the Almighty. [!]\nThe members of the hand concentrate their skills to the task of\neliminating false prophets and heathens. They seek out the heathen\nfilth and send their souls to the light via a bloodshed cleansing.\nThe creed: \"There is no forgiveness of sin without the shedding of\nblood.\" is very dear to them, and each has taken this crusade to\nheart. They also may aid in the gathering of new recruits, but this\nis not their main task.\n\n/3 The Crown of the Almighty. [^]\nThese members seek to enforce clan policy through intervention\nwhen the recruiters or the Anointed are unavailable. They report\ndirectly to the Anointed any violation that they witness within the\ncongregation, and are appointed only by the Anointed. Their prime\ntasks are the purging of false pledges, and to aid in collection of\nfunds of the clan.\n\nAll Ranks: Inquisitors.\nDue to vile forces of greed and lust, power struggles within the\nclan are all too frequent. The Inquisitors seek out those within\nthe clan whose faith in the Almighty and whose loyalty to the Anointed\nare weak or insubordinate. They report to the Grand Inquisitor or\ndirectly to the Anointed, who then deliberate on any action which\nmight be necessary to quell the disturbance. Who is an inquisitor?\nThat knowledge is only kept by the Grand Inquisitor and by the Anointed.\nAll inquisitors are chosen by the Grand Inquisitor or the Anointed. Any\ninquisitor who exposes his status can expect to have it revoked at best,\nor become an outcast at worst.\n\nRanks 1-3 are considered equal in all aspects, and shall be treated\nas such. No one rank is superior to the other, and should not become\nboastful over his brothers. Such boasting breeds intolerance and resentment,\nand is highly frowned upon.\n\n/4 The Preacher of Light, The Hand of Destruction, The Crowning Glory\nThe Holy Scribe, The Grand Inquisitor, Protectors of the Faith.\nThese select positions are hand picked by the Anointed, and given\nresponsibility of recruiting, as well as tending to their own\nbranch affairs. None possesses any rank above the other, and all report\ndirectly to the Anointed. These members also collect funds from the\nclan.\n\n/5 The Anointed of the Almighty.\nThese chosen children of the Almighty oversee all that happens within\nthe church of the Almighty. These people are said to be the direct\nvoice of the Almighty, and obediance of their decrees is required.\nThese people have complete control of the congregation, but may seek\nadvice on internal matters as they so choose.\n~\n\n\n\n-1 POSSE~\nA band of evil beings roamed the lands, spreading fear and chaos,\nkilling, looting, and bringing havoc to the world.  Within this band\nwere a few consumed with guilt, which could no longer bear the screams\nand death cries of the fallen.  Straying from their evil ways, they\nformed a Posse.\n\nThe Posse would no longer stand by and let criminals walk freely about\nthe world.  Thus, Posse attacks all KILLERS, THIEVES, THUGS, and\nRUFFIANS.  In doing so, Posse has made a few enemies along the way.\n\nPosse does not wage war upon any clan.  We strive to kill all KILLERS,\nTHIEVES, THUGS, and RUFFIANS, dealing swift justice where possible.\nTaking this into account, no member of Posse is to carry any of the \nabove flags, with the exception of the Ruffian flag.  We are of the\nunderstanding that sometimes excessive force is necessary, and also\nthat accidents _do_ happen.  Should other flags occur, each such incident\nwill be judged on its merits.  As a general rule, Thug flags are usually\nunacceptable at best and Killer and Thief flags are almost always an\noutcastable offense.  Exceptions can be made for bugs and extenuating\ncircumstances, again as the situation dictates.\n\nWe are not a group of individuals, we are a Clan family of sorts, in that\nwe help each other out whether it be pkilling, eq, grouping, spell-ups, \nor even just to sit and talk.  We do not group with those that carry\nflags, but will deal with them for goods if it is for the good of our\ngreater cause and they are deemed trustworthy enough to do so.\n\nPosse consists of those who are Good, Neutral, and Evil.  All races\nand classes are considered in joining, but we do not accept just anyone.\nPlayers are urged to talk to a recruiter at an early age/level as to\nnot invest too much time into a character who will be turned down.\nTeamwork is a _must_, as is clan/pkill experience.  Roleplaying is not\nrequired.\n\nSanctions will be handed out to those members of posse who have trouble\nfollowing the posse charter. These can be given by both /4s and /5s and\nwill generally last for the duration of your flag. However, if the /4 or /5\nyou ask to remove you sanction feels that you have not yet served your time\nthey will post a note to the clan stating why they feel that way and how\nlong they feel you should keep the sanctions. It will then be upto a /5 to\nremove the flag. Sanctions will be handed out as follows:\n\nRuffian - Skill, Store, Portal Room, Regen, Healer\nThug - Healer, Regen, Skill, Store, Portal Room, Hall for 1 week.\nKiller and Thief - Immediate outcast, no questions asked. \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You may not have a flag (see definition below).\n\nPosse Charter (rules)\n\n- any member of any clan that carries a flag (Killer, Thief, Thug or Ruffian),\n  is to be killed.\n- No member of Posse may carry any flag. Carrying a flag is grounds for \n  sanctions. The worse the flag the worse the sanctions.\n- Grouping with or helping any member of any clan with any flag is forbidden.\n~\n-1 SREDIR REDIR~\nAnd when He opened the seal there went out a horse that was red, and power was\ngiven unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that its\ninhabitants should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great\nsword...\n\nAnd behold there came forth an ashen horse, and he that sat upon him had a pair\nof balances in his hand; with a measure of wheat on one side and a mound of\ndust on the other.  And the power was given unto him to steal that which\nnourishes the body--and the spirit...\n\nAnd lo a black horse then appeared, and he that sat upon him bore a bow whose\narrows flew across the sky as an infectious cloud; and unto him the power to\ndisfigure and drain away the life of Man was given...\n\nAnd behold a pale horse arose; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell\nfollowed with him...\n\nAnd power was given unto them over the four parts of the Earth; to kill with\nthe Sword, and with Hunger, with Disease, and with Death...And lo there was a\ngreat earthquake; and the Sun became as black as sackcloth, and the Moon became\nas blood, and the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth...\n\nFor when the great day of His wrath has come...who shall be able to stand?\n\nMAKE WAY FOR THE APOCALYPSE...\n\n[Premise]\nWe are a lawful organization constrained by the inevitability of the End; we\nare but harbingers of the coming Apocalypse.  We do not seek out conflict or\ndestruction, nor do we believe in pkilling and pstealing with impunity.  Our\npurpose is not to bring about the End but rather to facilitate what inevitably\nmust, and will be.\n\nThose who wish to become minions of the Apocalypse must request an audience\nwith the proper Incarnation.\n\nWarriors should direct their requests for membership to WAR.\nThieves should direct their requests for membership to FAMINE.\nClerics should direct their requests for membership to PESTILENCE.\nMages should direct their requests for membership to DEATH.\n~\n\n-1 OUTCAST OUTCASTS~\nOutcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They\nare, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in\ntheir lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are\na few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:\n\n-- Attacking a fellow clan member\n-- Stealing from a fellow clan member\n-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan\n-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership\n-- Receiving a DWEEB flag\n-- Spying for another Clan\n-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention\n\nOnce someone has been Outcast, they may not rejoin another clan unless\na voucher is purchased, these cost 50eggs. \n\n~\n\n-1 DWEEB~\nDweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the\ngods themselves.  A Dweeb is given no safe haven, as they are allowed to be\nattacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can\nbestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for\na Dweeb flag:\n\n-- Continually spamming the public channels.\n-- Continually harrassing particular players.\n-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.\n-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.\n-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.\n-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.\n-- Using CB lingo on public channels\n-- Using l33t speak on public channels\n   (You don't look cool, you look like an idiot.  Real hackers don't use\n    it.  Quit watching TechTV.)\n\nNote that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings\nbefore you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to\nhave done something truly horrendous.\n\nAlso, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the\nperiod of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you\nmust live with it.\n~\n\n-1 MATOOK~\nHelp 'Matook'\nMatook is an organized group of characters that have shown interest\nin dedicating their time to helping out other individuals as they\ncan.  This can involve spell ups, retrieving equipment, corpse\nretrievals, enchantments, and other miscellaneous  tasks that the\nindividual is willing to do.\n\nThe helpers of Matook gathered together and created a Grand Church\nin the North-Western Corner of Midgaard. Here in the Church many\nhelpful souls can be found, as well they have provided fast healing\nand mana recouperation rooms for the needy.\n\nIf you believe in yourself to follow the ways of Matook and wish to\njoin their order be prepared to give an example of your skill and\nknowledge of Boinga.  You will be directed to speak with a member of\nthe Council who will bestow a quest upon you. Any Matooker will be\nwilling to answer any further questions about the the Church in\ngeneral and please don't be shy to ask for some assistance in any\narea. Of course, since Matookers are non-clanners, clan interference\nis always forbidden.\n\n\"One cannot love with anger and hate for fear will always ruin one's\nfate...To live a life full of peace one must love or see it decrease.\"\n\n-May Matook Protect You.\n\n~\n\n-1 DONATION DONATIONS~\n\nThe DIKU liscence states that I can not take any money from anyone \nplaying MHS.  I feel it my obligation to inform you that donations \nshould not be sent to me for the game.  \nFor further clarification e-mail:   rusty@mraz.org\n\n~\n\n-1 'NEWBIE INFO' NEWBIE~\n\n+ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +\n  |           W E L C O M E                N E W B I E              |\n  |  Welcome, mortal, to Moosehead SLED!

Below is a short summary of what's\nexpected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.\n\nNote:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.\n\nAll levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is\ncheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of\na higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings\nwith mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as\nyou would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of\nan Immortal.\n\n52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive\nor have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,\nsave to follow the same rules as everyone else.\n\n53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an\nImmortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how\nyou act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if\nyou are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be\nplaced at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the\nrules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the\nland, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of\nbeing an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob\nstrength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking\nquestions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.\n\n55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available\nto you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'\nstage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level\nwhere you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be\ngiven a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations\nat this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn\nOLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.\nYou have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any\nmajor decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced\nImmortal.\n\n57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to\nImmortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used\nto penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you\nshould have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,\nand a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at\nthis level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,\nbuild on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.\nYour conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but\nyou're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'\nonce you've reached this point.\n\n58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp\nof the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any\nsituation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to\nSenior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some\nof the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all\nImmortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected\nfor their dedication to MHS.\n\n59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still \nkeeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have\ntheir hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available\non MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,\nyou have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,\nor you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure\nabout, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS\ninside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins\nare also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new\ncode for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.\n\n60 - Implementor.  If you need to be told what your job as an Implementor\nis, you should probably put down the crack pipe now...\n\n~\n\n-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~\nYou may kill other players once you join a Clan or Loner.  If they are \nmore than 8* levels below you, you can't do it.  If your intended victim\nis not in a Clan, again you can't touch them (unless they have a THIEF \nor DWEEB flag). You may steal from other players if they are not more \nthan 7* levels below your level, and in a Clan. For either of the above \nactions you will recieve a flag and may have trouble with guards in town.  \nAlso other players may get to attack you.\n\nThere are specific ways to get certain flags:\n(Tf) A thief flag is gotten for failing an attempt at stealing from a \n     player.  You may be attacked by anyone up to 12 levels above you\n     when you have this flag.  It can only be lost by dying to another\n     player while you have no other flags.\n(R)  A ruffian flag is gotten from initiating combat on an unflagged \n     player. This flag has no consequence except saving someone who \n     attacks you from receiving a flag.  This flag is lost by dying to \n     another player.\n(Th) A thug flag is received if you actually kill a player. This \n     enables people up to 10 levels above you to attack you .  This \n     flag is lost by dying to a player either 1 or 2 times depending \n     on the number of players killed as a thug.\n(K)  A killer flag is earned by killing 3 players without dying in \n     between. The consequence is that {YANYONE{x may attack you. \n     The flag is lowered to a thug flag upon death at the hands of \n     another player.  When attacking somebody who origionally isn't \n     able to attack you, that person gains the right to attack you \n     until they have killed you.\n\nIs it worth it?  You decide.\n\n~\n\n52 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~\n.\n                         **********************\n                         ** The Rules of MHS **\n                         **********************\n \n1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.\n    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.\n \n2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. \n    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,\n    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    \n    and softening up or altering mobs.\n \n3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.\n    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly\n    go there themselves.\n \n4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.\n \n5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.\n \n6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie\n    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items\n    isn't.\n \n7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT \n    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some \n    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels\n    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).\n \n8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you \n    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore\n    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.\n \n9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  \n \n10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal\n    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.\n\n11) Do not argue with level 59 or 60 IMM's.  You're wrong, just admit it!\n~\n-1 PUFF~\nNo plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --\nHe grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.\nCompiles and simulations grew so quickly tame\nAnd swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.\nCHORUS:\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\nPuff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails\nAnd mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.\nAll the student hackers loved that fractal Puff\nBut DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, \"Enough!\"\n                (chorus)\nPuff used more resources than DCS could spare.\nThe operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.\nA gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,\nBut Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!\n                (chorus)\n~\n\n-1 CLIST~\nThis is a list of currently active clans on MHS.  For more details,\nsee the clan's helpfile \"help <clan name>\"\n\nHonor: A group of noble warriors, united in a common cause against\n       the evils of Boinga.\n\nDemise: A clan of bloodthirsty killers, solely intent upon the\n        destruction of good.\n\nWarlock: A clan of spellcasters, devoted to the preservation and\n         purity of magic.\n\nZealot: A group of religious fanatics, intent on preaching the word\n        of their God, and converting nonbelievers by any means\n        necessary.\n\nPosse: A militia who charge themselves with the eradication of\n       lawbreakers.\n\nLoner: Not members of a true clan, these warriors venture forth\n       into the dangerous lands of Boinga, with nobody to rely\n       on but themselves.\n\nOutcast: Once members of a clan, they have either left their old\n         life behind, or been banished forever for bring harm\n         upon their former brethen.\n\nSee the appropriate clan helpfile for more information, or speak with\na clan leader or recruiter (denoted by a rank of /5 or /4, respectively)\n~\n\n-1 RULES~\nThese are the rules of MHS.  For other matters, use common sense.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at ANY God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be\n  tolerated.\n\n* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods\n  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.\n  Please MAIL these bugs to: cascadia@nventure.com\n\n* Seerated player stealing or player killing.  Clanned players will NOT\n  involve non-clanned players in player killing in any way.  Non-Clanned\n  players will NOT intentionally involve themselves in player killing.\n  This includes spelling up clanners so they can go pkilling, or who are\n  being pkilled themsleves.  Nonclanners also cannot stand near pfights\n  and take disarmed weapons or fallen stones.\n\n* Summoning mobs and sleeping them at other aggresive mobs is forbidden.\n  If you summon Papa to the Dees and sleep Papa, and a nonclanner or \n  clanner gates to Papa, expect to be punished.  If you want to use Papa\n  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other\n  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive. \n\n  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or\n  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie\n  without their permission still is illegal.\n\n* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.\n  This includes using a script away from your terminal.\n  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.\n  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you\n  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your\n  typing woes, not play your character for you.\n\n* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with \n  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters, \n  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1 \n  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under \n  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are \n  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that \n  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,\n  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special\n  privileges. \n  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know\n  who someone's \"alt\" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over\n  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are\n  seperate.\n\n* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait\n  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between\n  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait\n  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.\n\n* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.\n  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.\n  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.\n  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too\n\n (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from\n  a pfight then dont take it.)\n\n* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless\n  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with\n  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the\n  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.\n\n* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and\n  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for \n  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are\n  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that\n  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To\n  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob\n  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with\n  them do not help them level.\n\n* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to\n  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.\n\n* Channel \"spamming\" and personal attacks on someone over public channels\n  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to\n  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse\n  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,\n  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.\n\n* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly\n  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you\n  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised\n  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.\n\n* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave\n  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while\n  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill \n  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT\n  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.\n  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal\n  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less\n  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.\n\n  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)\n  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)\n  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go\n   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).\n \n* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be\n  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have\n  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to \n  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage\n  character shall be denied.\n\n* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow\n  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is \n  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.\n\n* Other rules for clanned players are found in \"Help Clan\"\n\n* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and\n  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent\n  to Boogums (cascadia@nventure.com) \n\n* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty\n  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for\n  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could\n  increase the duration of your penalties.\n\n* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.\n  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs\n  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when\n  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base\n  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on\n  the web that have posting boards for such thins, such as:\n  http://www.mudconnector.com/\n\n* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same\n  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break \n  these rules.\n\n* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you\n  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means\n  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in\n  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your\n  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are\n  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.\n\n* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential\n  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so \n  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing\n  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or\n  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts\n  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections\n  are logged and will be watched.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be \n  tolerated.\n\n* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor \n  do the PEOPLE who run the game owe you anything.\n\n~\n\n0 SUICIDE DELETE~\nUse the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be\navailable for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,\nand you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will\nreturn your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the\nfirst delete.\n~\n \n0 HEALER~\nThe healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some\nservices are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see\na full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To\nreceive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.\n~ \n\n\n-1 GAIN~\nThe gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has \nbeen found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:\n\ngain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned\ngain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost\ngain apply :  turns 10 skill points into one practice \n\nGain uses practices to gain new skills, spell groups, and kits.\nGained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total\nnumber of creation points. \n~\n\n52 CLONE~\nSyntax:\n  clone obj <object>\n  clone mob <mobile>\n  clone <name>\n\nThe clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile\nthat may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in\nthe same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is\npreserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or\nmobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  \nStrung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.\n~\n\n\n0 SKILLS SPELLS~\nThe skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list\nof available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in\norder of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)\nlisted where applicable.\n~\n0 'SKILL POINTS'~\nSkill Points are rewarded to you for using your various skills in a \ncombat situation.  You cannot \"spam up\" a skill and get skill points.\nYou need to actually get out and do stuff.\n\nThey may be converted with the 'gain apply' command at the appropriate\nguildmasters into practices.\n~\n\n0 OUTFIT~\nThe outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with\na new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), \ncourtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.\n~\n\n0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT FULLSAC~\nMHS uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting\ngold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:\n\nautolist  : list all automatic actions\nautoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles\nautogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles\nautosac\t  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)\nautoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room\nautosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members\nautoassit : makes you help group members in combat\nfullsac   : able to sacrifice containers with items inside\n\nTyping a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. \n~ \n-1 CLAN CLANS~\nThroughout Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common\ncause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the\nspread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.\n\nIn order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,\neither by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name\nof their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4\nbeside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as\nfollows:\n\nYou must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast\nof any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either\njoined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.\n\nOnce you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If\nfor some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you\nmust first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  After outcasting you must\npurchase a voucher (not a cheap item) to gain access into a new clan. \nAlso, be wary, for those who make frequent changes in their clan find \nthemselves clanless quickly.\n\nExpect to be full looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your\nlife miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, however with that said\nthere must be an appeal to your humanity. Understand how full looting some\none makes them feel. Yes you've had it done to you, yes its a part of\nthe game. Do you really want to have a hand in driving off the player base?\nFind better ways to enjoy the game, help people stay and play. The larger\nthe player base grows the more fun you'll have and the more targets you'll\nhave. \n\nSee HELP CLIST for a list of currently active clans on MHS, and a brief\ndescription of the purpose of each clan.\n~\n-1 PRICES PRICE~\nPrice upgrades for clans\n==============================================================================\nThe prices below are for clans only.

To return \nto your main hall, you will have to use your traditional \nmeans of transportation.

DOTs use a special, faster tick\nthat kicks in every 10 seconds.  When this tick hits, the DOT runs its course,\ndoing damage to the victim.  Some DOT spells also do direct damage up front, but\nthis isn't a requirement of a DOT affect.  Most DOTs have no cure, but do low\namounts of damage, so low they often fall under the damage curve.  But for this\nvery reason, DOTs are also quite powerful, as they can do hundreds of points of\ndamage and none of it gets curved.  The cost is time, as a victim of a DOT can\nuse several tactics to reduce the effectiveness.  Most DOTs last 1-2 minutes \nand do gradually less damage as they go.  Many things affect how much damage\na DOT does, and none of those secrets will be divulged here.\n\nThe Shaman kit is the best in the game, having access to an elite corp of DOT\nspells in the 'disease' group.

In an effort to\n   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters\n   to \"refresh\" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that\n   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will\n   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years\n   and put everyone on a level playing field.\n\nQ: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?\n\nA: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you \n   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken\n   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all\n   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish\n   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation\n   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you\n   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.\n   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,\n   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.\n   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if\n   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal\n   creation.\n\nQ: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What\n   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after\n   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?\n\nA: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are\n   being discussed include giving out \"xp vouchers\" for the left over xp,\n   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally\n   decided, the answer will be posted here.\n\nQ: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?\n\nA: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through\n   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this\n   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc\n   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using\n   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can\n   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so \n   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.\n\nQ: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,\n   what good are they?\n\nA: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to \n   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you\n   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will\n   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices\n   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.\n\nQ: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.\n\nA: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending\n   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can\n   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills\n   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new\n   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that\n   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be\n   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it\n   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if\n   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.\n\nQ: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?\n\nA: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take\n   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the \n   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.\n\nQ: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my\n   practice sessions that way?\n\nA: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain\n   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up \n   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your\n   practice sessions.\n\nQ: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and\n   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?\n\nA: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your\n   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal\n   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,\n   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find\n   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.\n\nQ: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?\n\nA: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair \n   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all \n   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a \"stock\"\n   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly\n   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special\n   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special\n   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted\n   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of\n   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will\n   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.\n\nQ: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?\n\nA: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing\n   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we\n   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you\n   chose to change races.\n\nQ: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available\n   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?\n\nA: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and\n   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for\n   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes\n   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an \"old class\".\n   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level\n   and a few other things like delays on skills.\n\nQ: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?\n\nA: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the\n   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5\n   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,\n   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're\n   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will\n   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort\n   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.\n   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more\n   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be \n   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.\n\nQ: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want\n   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan\n   system?\n\n   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can \n   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be \n   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used\n   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader\n   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change\n   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,\n   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan\n   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).\n\nQ: What about my Mutant characters?\n\nA: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,\n   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not \n   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain\n   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once\n   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to\n   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you\n   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.\n\nQ: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I\n   think of something not covered in this help file?\n\nA: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had\n   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be \n   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that\n   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially\n   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding\n   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an\n   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either\n   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the \n   Admins.\n\nFINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of \n            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note\n\t    to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.

A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will\neventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which\nthis happens is generally very low at low levels.

After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your\nclass to practice skills.

Below is a short summary of what's\nexpected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.\n\nNote:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.\n\nAll levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is\ncheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of\na higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings\nwith mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as\nyou would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of\nan Immortal.\n\n52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive\nor have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,\nsave to follow the same rules as everyone else.\n\n53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an\nImmortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how\nyou act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if\nyou are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be\nplaced at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the\nrules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the\nland, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of\nbeing an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob\nstrength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking\nquestions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.\n\n55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available\nto you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'\nstage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level\nwhere you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be\ngiven a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations\nat this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn\nOLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.\nYou have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any\nmajor decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced\nImmortal.\n\n57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to\nImmortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used\nto penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you\nshould have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,\nand a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at\nthis level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,\nbuild on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.\nYour conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but\nyou're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'\nonce you've reached this point.\n\n58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp\nof the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any\nsituation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to\nSenior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some\nof the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all\nImmortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected\nfor their dedication to MHS.\n\n59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still \nkeeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have\ntheir hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available\non MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,\nyou have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,\nor you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure\nabout, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS\ninside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins\nare also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new\ncode for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.\n\n60 - Implementor.

If you want to use Papa\n  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other\n  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive. \n\n  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or\n  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie\n  without their permission still is illegal.\n\n* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.\n  This includes using a script away from your terminal.\n  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.\n  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you\n  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your\n  typing woes, not play your character for you.\n\n* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with \n  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters, \n  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1 \n  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under \n  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are \n  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that \n  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,\n  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special\n  privileges. \n  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know\n  who someone's \"alt\" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over\n  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are\n  seperate.\n\n* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait\n  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between\n  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait\n  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.\n\n* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.\n  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.\n  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.\n  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too\n\n (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from\n  a pfight then dont take it.)\n\n* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless\n  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with\n  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the\n  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.\n\n* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and\n  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for \n  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are\n  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that\n  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To\n  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob\n  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with\n  them do not help them level.\n\n* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to\n  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.\n\n* Channel \"spamming\" and personal attacks on someone over public channels\n  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to\n  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse\n  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,\n  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.\n\n* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly\n  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you\n  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised\n  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.\n\n* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave\n  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while\n  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill \n  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT\n  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.\n  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal\n  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less\n  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.\n\n  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)\n  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)\n  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go\n   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).\n \n* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be\n  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have\n  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to \n  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage\n  character shall be denied.\n\n* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow\n  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is \n  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.\n\n* Other rules for clanned players are found in \"Help Clan\"\n\n* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and\n  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent\n  to Boogums (cascadia@nventure.com) \n\n* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty\n  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for\n  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could\n  increase the duration of your penalties.\n\n* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.\n  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs\n  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when\n  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base\n  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on\n  the web that have posting boards for such thins, such as:\n  http://www.mudconnector.com/\n\n* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same\n  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break \n  these rules.\n\n* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you\n  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means\n  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in\n  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your\n  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are\n  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.\n\n* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential\n  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so \n  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing\n  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or\n  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts\n  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections\n  are logged and will be watched.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be \n  tolerated.\n\n* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor \n  do the PEOPLE who run the game owe you anything.","name":"0 SUICIDE DELETE","brief":"Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be\navailable for use.

These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the\nspread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.\n\nIn order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,\neither by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name\nof their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4\nbeside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as\nfollows:\n\nYou must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast\nof any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either\njoined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.\n\nOnce you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If\nfor some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you\nmust first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  After outcasting you must\npurchase a voucher (not a cheap item) to gain access into a new clan. \nAlso, be wary, for those who make frequent changes in their clan find \nthemselves clanless quickly.\n\nExpect to be full looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your\nlife miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, however with that said\nthere must be an appeal to your humanity. Understand how full looting some\none makes them feel. Yes you've had it done to you, yes its a part of\nthe game. Do you really want to have a hand in driving off the player base?\nFind better ways to enjoy the game, help people stay and play. The larger\nthe player base grows the more fun you'll have and the more targets you'll\nhave. \n\nSee HELP CLIST for a list of currently active clans on MHS, and a brief\ndescription of the purpose of each clan.","description":"-1 PRICES PRICE","race":"Price upgrades for clans\n==============================================================================\nThe prices below are for clans only.

They are also all cast very rapidly.\n\nThe spiritcaller kit is available to all races, all genders, but\nonly if they are druids.\n~\n\n0 'FENCE'~\nFences are the consumate sellers of goods.  They are real smooth \noperators, classy, mobster type slick guys.  They use the \nconnive skill in their trade.  Fences also know about the secret\nback rooms that most shopkeepers have.  This allows fences to\ntrade while invis or hidden.\nThis being said, the social stat is very important to them.\n\nSee also:  connive\n~\n0 'CONNIVE'~\nConnive is the skill used by a fence when selling goods.  It\nalso allows the fence to talk their way out of \"sticky\" \nsituations every now and then.\n\nSee also:  fence\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD BASH'~\nSyntax: shieldbash <Victim>\n\nAvailable to Warriors, Blademasters, Samurai, Paladins, Berzerkers.\n\nShield bash stuns your victim for 1 round, and makes spellcasting\nmore difficult for a brief period afterwards.\n~\n\n0 'SYMBOL'~\n\nThere are four Symbol spells.  They are available to clerics and\ncrusaders only.  Their whereabouts and purpose are unknown.\n\n~\n\n0 'HAMSTRING'~\nSyntax: hamstring <victim>\n\n  Hamstring is a specialized opening move for Rogues, Thieves, and\nAssassins.  Hamstring does not require any special weaponry, and it\ncan in fact be performed using only one's bare hands.  When successful,\nhamstring costs the victim moves, some DEXTERITY, and applies the slow\nflag.  Hamstring will also strip haste if it's there.  A hamstrung\nvictim will occassionally have trouble when moving from room to room.\nHaving high strength and constitution not only reduces this problem,\nbut helps to avoid getting hamstrung in the first place.  Hamstring's\nimpressive array of debilitative affects are countered by its short\nduration and the fact that it cannot be used in combat, meaning the\nthief must give up on an opening backstab to use this manuever.\n\n~\n\n0 'ACCLIMATE'~\nSyntax: c 'acclimate' <target>\n\n   Acclimate attunes the recipient to the ambient energy of his or her\nsurroundings, making him/her regenerate incredibly rapidly.  If the\nrecipient of this spell does *ANYTHING* or takes damage from almost\nany source, the spell will cancel.  The recipient must remain absolutely\nstill to receive the full affect.  Druids only may cast this spell.\nThe spell can only be acquired via spell pages.\n\nThe location of this spell page is unknown.\n~\n\n0 'RESEARCH'~\n\n   Research is the skill that mages uses to create new spell scrolls.\nThe higher the skill, the more likely the mage is to successfully\ncraft spell pages.  Research is given automatically to all Mages\nand Wizards.\n\n   Currently most spell research must be done at the public magelab\nin Midgaard, which has recently purchased a MageLab 2000 research kit.\n~\n\n0 'REGENERATION'~\nSyntax: cast 'regeneration' <target>\n\n    This is a restoration-over-time spell.  It lasts for about 4\nminutes and heals a small amount of hit points during that time.\nIt is available to clerics, crusaders, and any hybrids that could\nbe old class cleric.  This spell belongs to no group and must be\nfound on spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'CRITICAL HIT'~\n\n    Critical strikes are a feature that is only available to classes\nthat can be old class warriors.  These are Warrior, Blademaster, Samurai\nBerserker, and Paladin.  If you are one of these classes and you are\noldclass Warrior, you will automatically receive critical strikes.  They\ndo extra damage based on your level.\n\n   If you are not an oldclass warrior but are one of these classes, you\ncan buy the ability to have critical hits by taking the 'enhanced \ncritical' skill.  This will give you critical hitting ability akin to\na warrior's inate ability.  For warriors, this will improve your chance\nof landing a critical hit.  For all characters with 'critical strike'\nthe damage curve is softened slightly.\n\n  Two other specialized crits are available.  'Bludgeoning' works with\nbash weapons, and 'Cleave' works with slashing weapons.  Both give an\nadditional chance to land a critical strike.\n\n  Note that you don't have to take enhanced critical to use cleave or\nbludgeoning.  \n\n Example:\tCleric Paladin\n\tHas no natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit', he\nhas basic crit ability with a soft curve.  If he takes 'cleave', he\nhas better crit chance with slashing weapons, and regular crit chance\nwith all others, and a softer curve.\n\n Example:\tBlademaster\n\tHas natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit' he has\nbetter chance to land a crit plus a softer curve.  If he takes 'cleave',\nhe gets a REALLY good chance to crit with slashers, improved chance to\ncrit with everything else, and soft damage curve.\n~\n\n0 'ENHANCED CRITICAL' 'CLEAVE' 'BLUDGEON'~\nSee 'CRITICAL HIT'.\n~\n\n0 'SUNBURST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sunburst' <target>\n\n    Sunburst is a single-target offensive spell.  It deals LIGHT damage,\nnot fire, and as such it has the potential to blind the victim from the\nintense light.  Sunburst does slightly less damage than the spell 'acid\nblast,' which is part of the basic training of most Boingan mages.\n\n   The origins of the Sunburst spell are unknown.  Researchers have\ndetermined that it is probably usable by Wizards, Mages, and Druids.\n~\n\n0 'SONIC BLAST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sonic blast' <target>\n\n    Sonic Blast emits a wall of mechanic waves that slam into a target in\na concentrated force, snapping bones and causing pain.  Sonic blast does\nslightly less damage than the standard Boingan spell 'acid blast'.   It\nhas the potential to stun the victim for 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of\ncombat.\n\n    Nobody knows where this spell comes from.  A leading researching at\nthe New Thalos academy of magic has suggested that a renegade mage may\nhave escaped into Altirin and developed the spell there.\n~\n\n0 'ADAMANTITE SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'adamantite skin'\n \n    Available to Mages and Wizards only, 'adamantite skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as adamantite.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.  The pages must be researched at the public mage\nlab.  The formula for the adamantite page can be found at the same \nlocation as one of the ingredients.\n~\n\n0 'INCINERATE'~\nSyntax: cast 'incinerate' <victim>\n\n    Incinerate is identicle to the 'acid blast' spell, except it does\nfire-based damage.  Incinerate is available to mages and wizards only.\nIt must be researched at the mage's guild in Midgaard.  The formula\nto create the spell scroll can be found at the magelab.\n~\n\n0 'STEEL SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'steel skin'\n\n\tAvailable to Mages and Wizards only, 'steel skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as steel.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'DIAMOND SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'diamond skin'\n\n\tDiamond skin is available to Mages and Wizards only.  It\ntransforms the flesh of the caster to a diamond-like substance\ncapable of repelling all damage.  Each attack lowers the duration of\nthe affect until eventually it fades completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF FAITH'~\nSyntax: cast 'shield of faith'\n\n   This self-only spell is available to Clerics, Crusaders, Paladins,\nDruids, and Monks.  A shimmering shield of protection is draped over\nthe shoulders of the caster by his/her deity.  The shield will absorb\nthe next several attempts to injure the caster.  The number of attacks\nit absorbs depends on the casting level of the caster.\n\n    This spell belongs to no spell group.  It may only be learned via\nspell pages and the Ritual.\n~\n\n0 RITUAL~\nSyntax: ritual\n \n   The Ritual is a rite by which religious classes learn new spells.\n To perform the ritual, the caster must be holding a spell page that\n has a copy of the spell he wants to learn, and be in an Altar room.\n The better the Altar, the better the chance of the Ritual being \n successful.  Four main factors influence the success of the Ritual.\n A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Level help the caster perform\n the Ritual properly.  But the inherent complexity of the scroll makes\n it more difficult.  \n\n If the Ritual is successful, the caster will receive the spell in his\n 'practice' and 'spells' list, and it functions like a normal spell\n after that.  The scroll is no longer needed, and the caster will never\n lose the spell.  It can be practiced and used like any other spell.\n It does not belong to any spell group.\n\n The caster must meet a level requirement for using the scroll, which\n is generally far lower than the actual level of the spell.  Whether\n or not the Ritual works, the scroll will lose 1 use.  Most scrolls have\n only 1 use, but some lesser scrolls may have more.\n\n The Ritual only works for oldclass clerics.  Oldclass mages will have\n to use study command.\n~\n\n0 STUDY~\nSyntax:  study <scroll name>\n\nThis command only works if your oldclass is mage.  It does one thing:  \ncopy a spellpage.\n\nIf the study attempt  is successful, the caster will receive the spell \nin their 'practice' and 'spells' list.  Once you have enscribed it, the\nthe spellpage is no longer needed.  The learned spell can be practiced\nand used like any other spell.  It does not belong to any spell group.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, 'spell pages'\n\n~\n0 'SPELL PAGES'~\nSpell pages are special scrolls that are found throughout the land of\nBoinga.  They enable an oldclass mage or cleric to learn a new scroll\nwithout having to gain the scroll from a Guildmaster.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, study\n\n~\n0 'REMOVE DISEASE'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove disease' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It \nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Disease is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks disease-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on plague or other non-DOT disease spells.  Remove Disease will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Disease gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 'REMOVE POISON'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove poison' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It\nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Poison is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks poison-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on 'poison' or other non-DOT poison spells.  Remove Poison will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Poison gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 SURNAME~\nSyntax:\tsurname <name>\n\n  Characters who have reached level 35 may select a surname.  This name\n  must conform to the same rules as first names.  You may have the same\n  surname as another character if you wish.  Nobody owns a surname, and\n  nobody has to have your permission to use yours.  Surnames can only be\n  changed by an IMMORTAL once set.  This is not normally done unless your\n  surname is inappropriate, or your character gets married and wishes to\n  take the surname of his or her spouse.  Surnames are only displayed in\n  your score and the who list,  and serve no purpose but for roleplaying \n  and fun.\n\n  You can toggle whether or not you see surnames in the who list by \n  using \"brief surname.\"\n\n~\n\n0 PREFRESH PFRESH~\n\nQ: What exactly is this prefresh I keep hearing about?\n\nA: Over the course of the almost 6 years MHS has been around, characters\n   have levelled under many different systems of gains.  In an effort to\n   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters\n   to \"refresh\" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that\n   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will\n   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years\n   and put everyone on a level playing field.\n\nQ: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?\n\nA: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you \n   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken\n   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all\n   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish\n   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation\n   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you\n   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.\n   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,\n   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.\n   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if\n   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal\n   creation.\n\nQ: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What\n   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after\n   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?\n\nA: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are\n   being discussed include giving out \"xp vouchers\" for the left over xp,\n   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally\n   decided, the answer will be posted here.\n\nQ: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?\n\nA: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through\n   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this\n   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc\n   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using\n   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can\n   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so \n   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.\n\nQ: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,\n   what good are they?\n\nA: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to \n   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you\n   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will\n   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices\n   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.\n\nQ: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.\n\nA: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending\n   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can\n   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills\n   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new\n   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that\n   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be\n   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it\n   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if\n   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.\n\nQ: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?\n\nA: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take\n   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the \n   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.\n\nQ: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my\n   practice sessions that way?\n\nA: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain\n   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up \n   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your\n   practice sessions.\n\nQ: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and\n   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?\n\nA: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your\n   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal\n   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,\n   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find\n   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.\n\nQ: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?\n\nA: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair \n   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all \n   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a \"stock\"\n   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly\n   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special\n   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special\n   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted\n   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of\n   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will\n   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.\n\nQ: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?\n\nA: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing\n   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we\n   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you\n   chose to change races.\n\nQ: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available\n   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?\n\nA: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and\n   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for\n   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes\n   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an \"old class\".\n   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level\n   and a few other things like delays on skills.\n\nQ: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?\n\nA: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the\n   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5\n   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,\n   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're\n   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will\n   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort\n   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.\n   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more\n   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be \n   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.\n\nQ: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want\n   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan\n   system?\n\n   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can \n   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be \n   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used\n   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader\n   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change\n   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,\n   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan\n   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).\n\nQ: What about my Mutant characters?\n\nA: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,\n   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not \n   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain\n   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once\n   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to\n   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you\n   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.\n\nQ: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I\n   think of something not covered in this help file?\n\nA: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had\n   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be \n   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that\n   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially\n   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding\n   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an\n   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either\n   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the \n   Admins.\n\nFINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of \n            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note\n\t    to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.  He'll consider\n\t    adding in your question if it hasn't already been answered.\n\n\n~\n\n0 MYRMIDON~\n\nMyrmidon\nConcept - The ultimate campaigner, the myrmidon is a classic soldier.\nThe military life is law to this kit.  Myrmidons live and die for the\nmartial life.  As a result of their rigid adherence to law and order,\nand the chain of command they tend to be strict and inflexible.\nHowever, the myrmidon is also highly trained in standard combat\nand is a skilled and powerful fighter.\n\nBenefits: \n* Specialization is free.  If the myrmidon has a specialization already\nwhen he picks up the kit, he'll be refunded the trains for it.\n* Because of their extensive training in basic combat prowess,\nmyrmidons, when using their specialized weapon, receive second\nand third attacks more often, anywhere from 125% to 150% depending\non the weapon skill percent and the myrmidon's level.\n* Also because of their extensive training, myrmidons receive a\nfourth attack skill.  With 100% in his/her specialized weapon\nand level 51, the myrmidon receives second attacks 75% of the\ntime, third attacks 50% of the time, and fourth attacks 25% of\nthe time.  These only apply with the specialized weapons.\n\nDrawbacks:\n* Because of their regimented martial life, these soldiers are less\nfamiliar with other fighting styles than their own.  As a result, they\nfight at a slight penalty when going up against creatures of a different\nsize (though not of a difference race if the race is the same size).\nThis penalty decreases as the myrmidon levels.\n\n~\n\n0 SPECIALIZE SPECIALIZATION~\nSyntax: specialize <weapon>\n\tspecialize help (displays this help file and costs)\n\nSpecialization is an option available to warriors and warrior reclasses\nSpecialization offers the warrior a better hitroll, more damage, and a\nremote shot at an extra attack.  Warriors and Blademasters may specialize in\nanything.  The warrior reclasses may specialize as follows:\n \n Samurai: sword, polearm, dagger\n Berzerker: sword, mace, axe\n Paladin: sword, flail, mace\n\nNote: In order to specialize, your oldclass must be warrior. IE a cleric\n      paladin cannot specialize, but a warrior paladin can.\n\n ~\n0 PAB 'PLAYER ADVISORY BOARD'~\nThe player advisory board (PAB) is an outlet for the coders to receive feedback about the major concerns for the game. Issues and suggestions brought forth by the PAB do not have to be implemented at all. Keep that in mind.\n\nEach clan will have 1 member on the board, usually the clan leader, but it can be anyone the clan decides to represent them. Clans can call for a change of representation at any time if the motion is supported by 3 different people, not characters. There will be 3 non-clanner positions on the board. Non-clanners will be appointed to the board by the immortal in charge of the PAB after having applied. These positions will be reviewed and possibly rotated on a monthly basis. Members of the player advisory board will receive an extra (PAB) flag by their name and be able to read notes posted to PAB. This will allow the other players to know who to talk to with their concerns. Being a member of the board is not something to be taken lightly, you will be required to post notes, attend meetings, and talk to the player base quite often.\n\nMeetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis. All other correspondence between the PAB will be through notes to all members, or through tells in order to come up with a working note to post. All members of the player advisory board will have their opinions considered, however the most popular idea will be the one that is sent on to the coders. Any questions about the PAB or its function will be answered by the immortal in charge of it at the time. No one else on the imm team is to be contacted concerning the PAB.\n\nImm currently in charge of the PAB: Hobkin\n\nMortals on the PAB have the PAB flag next to their names.\n\n\n~\n\n0 PYROTECHNICS~\n\nThe pyrotechnics spell group involves the creation of explosive materials.\nIts use is currently limited to samurai, monks and assassins. The spells \nare very powerful.\n\nsmall bomb: a small explosive device explodes on the target\nhigh explosive: blasts opponents with a larger bomb\nsmoke screen: obscures vision and allows an escape from combat\n\n**NOTE: Only Monks,Assassins and Samurai's get Smoke Screen **\n~\n\n0 NETHERMANCER NETHERMANCY FADE~\n\n   The Nethermancer is the most mysterious and unpredictable of spellcasters.\nThrough the art of {Cnethermancer{x, this kit can transfer hp to mana and vice\nversa as needed, at an exchange rate of 2::1.  This conversion is automatic.\nA perfect Nethermancer can only be destroyed when both his hit points and mana\nreach 0.  The Nethermancer also has a unique and uncontrollable ability to \nbecome completely invisible at will.  He cannot control when this happens and\nwhen it ceases, though he can force himself to become visible by engaging in\ncombat.  Nethermancers refer to this skill/annoyance as the {Cfade{x.  Finally,\nthe Nethermancer can bestow upon any weapon a special type of enchantment,\ncalled the nether flag.  What this does, nobody knows, and how the Nethermancer\nmanages to do it, nobody knows that either.  Nethermancers are automatically\noutfitted with a set of special robes.  If they lose their robes, they may use\nthe \"outfit\" command to get another set.  \n\nNethermancers cannot wear armor.\nArmor is defined as any item whose item type is armor.\n~\n\n0 BLADESINGER BLADESONG~\n\nSyntax: Bladesong\n        Bladesong stop\n\n   The Bladesinger is a special type of elf combatant.  Through the use of the\n{Cbladesong{x skill, the elven bladesinger receives a variety of bonuses in\ncombat, as well as up to a 25% chance for an extra attack during each combat\nround.  Bladesong can only be performed with a sword or dagger, and cannot be\nused if the bladesinger is wearing a shield.\n\n   Bladesong stop will end your deadly dance with the blades.\n~\n\n0 BATTLERAGER 'KILLING RAGE'~\n\n  The Battleragers are the elite corps of dwarven warriors.  Ragers are \nunstable at best, flying into insane fits of intense rage.  They can actually\ninflate their own hit points through the use of the {Ckilling rage{x, as well\nas receive a variety of other combat bonuses, including a chance at an extra\nattack during each combat round.  Battleragers can only perform the {Crage{x\nwhen wielding an axe, and cannot see their own hit point count while affected\nby the rage.\n~\n\n0 DAETOK~\n  Syntax: daetok\n\n  Dae'Tok is a Yinnish fighting style that cannot be learned by any other race.\nIt involves a style of trainin that Yinn are taught from childhood, and results\nin spectacular accuracy and maximum potential for damage with any form of \nweapon.  All Yinn become better with this skill as they advance in their\ncareers.  Dae'tok increases both the hitroll and damroll, and increases the\nchances of landing {Csecond{x and {Cthird{x attacks.\n\n~\n\n0 RANGERS~\n\n  The ranger is a master of the wilderness.  As such, (s)he fights most\neffectively in nature - plains, forests, hills and mountains, and is\nuncomfortable and ill-at-ease when indoors or in urban areas.  All rangers\nmay declare a species enemy (see {cSPECIES ENEMY{x), and will receive bonuses\nwhen fighting against any player or creature of that species.  The ranger's\ndislike of his/her species enemy is so strong that those creatures are \npenalized in defensive skills when defending against the ranger.  Rangers may\nmove from any sector to any sector for one movement point, and receive +3 \nmoves when they level.  They also may dual wield with any combination of\nweapon types.\n\nNOTE:  When the material table is complete, Rangers will be forbidden from\nwearing armor made from non-natural materials.  This means they'll be \nrestricted to leathers, cloth, wood, and the like.\n~\n\n0 'SPECIES ENEMY'~\nSyntax: species <race>\n\n   Rangers do not have to declare a species enemy, but the cost of this \nfeature is included with the price of the kits, they pay for it whether they\nuse it or not.  The species enemy must be a PC race.  Once you pick one, you\ncan never -ever- change it.  Select wisely.  Rangers fight remarkably well\nwhen going up against their species enemy, and members of that race don't\ndefend as well against the ranger.  You may not declare your own race as your\nspecies enemy.\n~\n\n0 'TUTINDEX'~\n\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n GETTING STARTED        Introduction to MHS\n TUT2\t\t\tPractices and Trains\n TUT3\t\t\tLevels and Rules Changes\n\n~\n\n0 'GETTING STARTED'~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n   Moosehead SLED is based on ROM2.3, so if you've ever played a ROM MUD,\nmany of these elements will be familiar to you.  If you are new to MHS or\nmudding, this file is designed to help you get started.  One of the first\nthings you will want to do is familiarize yourself with the commands.  The\n\"score\" command contains most of the relevent information about your character.\nThe \"worth\" and \"attrib\" commands show your gold/silver line and attributes\nlines seperately.  The \"who\" command lists all the characters that are logged\nin right now (that you can see).  Type \"equipment\" to see what gear your\ncharacter is currently wearing.  The \"inventory\" command lists the things that\nhave on you but are not currently using.  We recommend that you go through\nthe newbie school (type {crecall{x, {cup{x, {cnorth{x to get there) to get\na good head stat. \n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut2'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT2~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 2 \n\nTRAINS and PRACTICES\n   Your character improves by killing beasties and getting experience.  By\ngaining experience you eventually gain levels, which allow you to learn and\nuse new skills, spells, and abilities.  All new skills that you learn will\nbegin at 1% (except recall and scan, which start at 50%).  Although your skills\nwill naturally improve with use, you have to jump-start them by practicing\nthem.  A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will\neventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which\nthis happens is generally very low at low levels.  To practice a skill, you\nneed to locate a trainer (there is one in the Newbie school, follow the\nsigns to find him).  After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your\nclass to practice skills.  To practice a skill, you need to have at least 1\n{Gpractice{x session available (type {Cpractice{x to see how many you have).\nSimply type: {Cpractice <skill_name>{x, where <skill_name> is the skill\nthat you wish to practice.  Do not use quotes.  The skill you selected will\nincrease by a few percentage points.  The higher your {YINT{x is when you\npractice, the more your skills will increase with each {Gpractice{x session.\nThe highest a skill can go with manually practicing is 75%.  For anything\nbeyond that, you'll just have to use the skill and let it improve naturally.\nYou begin with 5 {Gpractices{x and you receive from 1 to 5 more every time\nyou level.  The higher your {YWIS{x is when you level, the more {Gpractice{x\nsessions you receive.\n\n   Your character also has 5 primary {Yattributes{x that summarize his or her\nabilities.  They are: {Ystrength{x, {Ydexterity{x, {Yintelligence{x, \n{Ywisdom{x, {and {Yconstitution{x.  See the individual help files for each \nfor detailed information on how they affect your character.  {YAttributes{x\nstart at a specific value depending on what race and class you selected. To\nimprove your attributes, you use a {Gtraining{x session.  You begin with 3\n{Gtrains{x and after that, you receive 1 more every time you level.  Your\n{Yattributes{x range from 3 to 25, and usually start out between 10 and 15.\nYou will want to train your {YCON{x and {YWIS{x first.  This action also\nrequires a trainer.  There is one in the newbie school.  These trainers are\nnot always the same as the {Gpractice{x trainers.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut3'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT3~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 3\n\nLEVELS and RULES CHANGES\n \n   As your character levels up, some of the game rules will change.  Also,\nyou'll be gradually forced to explore more the game world.  At level 6, you\nwill nol onger be able to enter newbie school, and must locate trainers in \nthe world somewhere.  Your character does not have to worry about the size of\nhis/her armor until level 11, and is able to use the {Crecall{x skill at will\nuntil level 11 as well.  After that, recalling requires the use of deity gifts\n(see {chelp deity{x), spells, or magic items.  The game will warn you about \nthese changes as you approach level 11.\n\n   When you level, it is in your best interests to wear what is called\n\"levelling gear.\"  Anything can technically be \"levelling gear\", but this\nterm generally refers to equipment that people only wear when they are about\nto level.  Usually this equipment gives you bonuses to your {YCON{x, {YWIS{x,\nand {YINT{x (see the helpfiles for each attribute for more information).\nWhere do you find levelling gear?  Ask around and explore, that is your best\nbet.  Note that when you level, the amount of experience that you need to \nreach the next level doesn't change.  Rather, you begin to gradually get less\nexperience for the same monsters.  You'll need to explore and find new monsters\nto slaughter that are more of a challenge.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut4'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 SPELLCRAFT~\n\n   Spellcraft is a special skill in which the spellcaster has studied\nthe metaphysics of spellcasting.  Those skilled with spellcraft are able\nto identify which spells other are casting, whether they are of the same class\nor not.  They also suffer a smaller mana drain when they loose concentration,\ncan sometimes cast a +1 over their normal casting level.  Spellcraft has a\nvariety of other, more subtle effects that make for a more solid \nspellcasting character.  This skill is incredibly difficult to increase.\n~\n\n0 BANKS BANKING DEPOSIT WITHDRAW~\nSyntax: deposit <#>\n        withdraw <#>\n\n   There is one banker in Midgaard, his name is Otho, he can be\nfound on clan road.  You may only deposit eggs into the bank, and they\nmust be in your inventory for you to do it.  Your total number of eggs\nin the bank is listed in your score.  You do not collect interest and \nthere is no minimum balance.  Your eggs are completely safe in the bank.\nNotice that unsavory individuals may hang around and attempt to steal your\neggs when you go to deposit/withdraw them.  The bank is not responsible \nfor stolen eggs.  \n\n~\n\n0 COLOR COLOUR~\n\n   Syntax based on Lope's standard colour code.\n\n   To enable color, type \"color on\".  To disable, type \"color off\".\n\n   This SLED automatically colorizes some elements of the game.  If you do\nnot like our colors, do not turn color on.  If you want to use only a few\nparts of color, get a client and utilize its color features.\n\n   You may use the following in any place to create color; notes, titles,\ntells, channel use, any where.  Please note that if you do not reset the\ncolor to 'normal', your color will bleed.  If you do this, you will be \nfrozen, so be very careful.\n\n    Red:    {{r for {rnormal{x, {{R for {Rbright{x\n    Blue:   {{b for {bnormal{x, {{B for {Bbright{x\n    Green:  {{g for {gnormal{x, {{G for {Gbright{x\n    Yellow: {{y for {ynormal{x, {{Y for {Ybright{x\n    Black:  {{D for {Dblack{x,  {{W for {Wwhite{x\n    Cyan:   {{c for {cnormal{x, {{C for {Cbright{x\n    Magenta:{{m for {mnormal{x, {{M for {Mbright{x\n    NORMAL: {{x resets colors to normal.\n     \n    Proper use of color:\n\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS{{x!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS{x!\n\n    Improper use:\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp>\n    {x\n\n    Get it?  If not, don't use it, please.  We don't issue warnings for\n    stupidity.\n~\n\n\n0 TRADE TRADING MUDTRADER~\nMudTrader 1.1\n\nSyntax: trade <cmd> <arg1> |amount|\n\nCommand Summary\n> trade request <character>\t \t- Start a trade \n> trade accept <character>\t\t- Accept a request to trade\n> trade decline <character>\t\t- Decline a request to trade\n> trade clear\t\t\t\t- Clear the current trade\n> trade cancel\t\t\t\t- Abort current trade\n> trade add <item in inventory>\t\t- Add something to the trade\n> trade add <gold|silver> <amount>\t- Add money to the trade\n> trade remove <item in trade>\t\t- Remove an item from the trade\n> trade remove <gold|silver> <amount>   - Remove money from the trade\n> trade show\t\t\t\t- Display current trade\n> trade approve\t\t\t\t- Finalize trade\n\nMudTrader is a special program that lets the MUD software act as a\nthird-party agent between two players who want to trade something,\nor purchase something from each other.  When you are trading, the money\nand items are removed from your inventory and held in memory.  If you remove\nthe items/money from the trade, leave the room, or cancel/clear the trade,\nyou get them back.  If you approve the trade, they go over to the other\nperson and are no longer yours.  When you are happy with the trade, type\n\"trade approve\" to finalize it.  BOTH traders must type \"trade approve\"\nfor it to work.  If anybody changes the trade, by either adding to it or\nremoving stuff from it, both people must type \"trade approve\" again.\n~\n\n-1 WIZLIST~\n\n        ________      ===============================      ________\n      /+_+_+_+_+_\\    |    The Gods of Moosehead    |    /+_+_+_+_+_\\\n      \\__________/    ===============================    \\__________/\n        |::XXXX|                                           |XXXX::|\n        |X::XXX|              Creator / IMP                |:XXXX:|\n        |XX::XX|               -----------                 |::XXXX|\n\t|XXX::X|        Rusty, The Oxidizing Dragon        |X::XXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|            Benefactor / Coder             |:XXXX:|\n        |XXXX::|               -----------                 |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|       Boogums \"BooglyDude\" McDugal        |::XXXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |:XXXX:|                                           |XXXX::|\n/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\                           /<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\\n\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/       Immortals           \\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\n       |.  /\\ . |            ---------------              |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Alagaster                 | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |               BriarRose  - ADMIN        |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |               KallaLilly                |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Karag                     | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|               Kuno - ADMIN              | . /\\  .|\n       | .//\\.  |               Slodhian - ADMIN          | .//\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       |.  /\\  .|                                         |.  /\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | .//\\  .|     Long live the memory of Mandrake    | .//\\  .|\n        \\. /\\  /         who left before his time.         \\. /\\  /\n         \\ /\\ /    [ IMMORTAL ] Grey Kellam : Mandrake      \\ /\\ /\n          \\/\\/                                               \\/\\/\n           \\/                                                 \\/\nArt by Blackstaff and Sara\n\nLast Updated By Boogums - 30NOV03\n~\n-1 HERO HEROES~\nThe list that follows is that of those who have attained the\nlevel of 52.

Here, anyone of level 52\nor higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the\nusual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;\nexamples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to\ncreation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,\nability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote\nplayers to immortality.\n\nSince immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)\na carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal\nbehavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without\nexplicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please\ndon't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or\nyou'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to\nthis file.\n\nThe duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,\nare topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are\nfraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)\n~\n\n-1 SOCIALS~\n \nThis is a complete list of socials for Moosehead SLED:\nCompiled originally by: Sara\naccuse       adjust      air          apologize     applaud     babble\nbark         bcatch      beckon       beer          bearhug     beg\nbird         bkiss       bleed        blink         blush       boast\nboggle       bonk        bounce       bow           brb         burp\ncackle       caress      charge       cheer         chuckle     clap\nclaw         collapse    comfort      comb          cough       cover\ncower        cringe      criticize    cry           cuddle      curse\ncurtsey      dance       daydream     drool         duck        embrace\nexplode      eyebrow     faint        fart          flare       flash\nflex         flinch      flip         flirt         flutter     fondle\nfrench       frown       fume         gasp          giggle      glare\ngoose        grimace     grin         groan         grope       grovel\ngrowl        grumble     hand         head          hiccup      highfive\nhop          howl        hug          hush          ignore      innocent\ninsane       judge       kiss         knee          laugh       lick\nlove         lust        massage      meditate      moan        moon\nmosh         mutter      nibble       nod           nudge       nuzzle\npant         passout     pat          peck          pie         pinch\npissed       plead       point        poke          ponder      pout\npray         propose     puke         punch         purr        ramble\nraspberry    rofl        roll         rub           ruffle      run\nscratch      scream      serenade     shake         shiver      shrug\nsigh         sing        slap         slobber       smile       smirk\nsnap         snarl       sneeze       snicker       sniff       snore\nsnort        snowball    snuggle      sob           spam        spank\nspit         squeal      squeeze      squirm        stare       stretch\nstrip        stroke      strut        sulk          swoon       tackle\ntease        thank       threaten     tickle        tip         tongue\ntwiddle      type        undress      view          wave        whine\nwhistle      wiggle      wince        wink          wonder      worry\nworship      yawn        yeehaw       yodel         rose\tlaces\ntank\t     starve\t aargh\t      homework\t    puff\tdiffer\nyae\t     lightbulb   voodoo       ogg\t    confused\tbeam\nbite\t     discodance  scuff        whap\t    lag\t\tchortle\nzerbert      twitch      roxbury\n \n~\n\n-1 MERC~\nThis sled is based on Merc 2.1, created by Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn.  \nMerc 2.1 is available as Merc_21.tar.gz from ftp.tcp.com and \nftp.math.okstate.edu.\nE-mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com' to join the merc mailing list.\n\nThanks to ...\n  ...

He was travelling the land and noticed that\nthere was power in the magical arts that was far beyond his or any others'\ncomprehension. He decided from that day forth to unite all pure spellcasters\nso as to fully understand and improve upon the arts of magic. He and his\nfaithful followers travelled the lands of Boinga to search out all those that\nhad the pure blood of magic in their veins. Those who would not join him and\nhis brethren were made to pay with their lives.\n\nHere we are left but a few proud spellcasters who have survived the trials\nof time. Now we shall rise again amongst the ashes of our ancestors. In our\nplight to truly unite the purity of magic, we have been forced to divide\ninto three sects.\n\nThose who adorn the White Robes of Warlock show the purity of magic through\nkindness. Their role in our clan is to guide all young spellcasters to gain\nknowledge of the magical arts.\n\nThose who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.\n\nThose who adorn the Black Robes of Warlock use the darker side of magic to\npunish the renegades who chose not to follow the true path, and defend our\nclan against those who would wage war. \n\nOur goals of the unity of pure magic has made us a very diverse clan, and for\nall those interested you may speak with any member of our clan and they will\nput you in touch with our recruitment officers.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements:\n  \n* You must be a pure spellcaster\n  (mage, cleric, elementalist, druid, wizard, crusader)\n   \nWarlock Charter (rules)\n*  You may not group with any clanner who is a:\n   Mage, Cleric, Elementalist, Druid, Wizard, or Crusader\n   They abuse the art and are to be killed on site.\n\n*  You may group with / help any nonclanner.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 RONOH~\n.\"It is a time of ideals,\n of leaders, of followers,\n of love, of friendship,\n of life, of death...\n of Honor.\"\n\nWE are the new generation of Honor clansmen and women.

They were a peacefull kind, only wishing to keep their \nrace going, raising cattle, and growing crops.  But as outsiders came to \nthe lands of the Goblins and tried to take over their farmland, it became \nobvious they would need some kind of defense, an army of some sort to fend \noff the newcommers.  And so was formed the Legion.\n\nThe Legion has one reason for being, and that is to keep the Goblins alive.\nIf you are a Goblin, and want to stand up for yourself in this world of\nraces far bigger then the Goblins, then the Legion is the place for you.\nThe Legion does not wish to seek out battle, we just wish to defend ourselves.\nAny race can join the Legion, but only a Goblin can ever hope to become\nanything more then just a guardsman.\n\nIf you wish to join the Legion, to help the Goblin race survive, you must\ncontact one of the leaders, or a recruiter, in a note or when you meet one\non-line. You must be able to roleplay, because the Legion is a clan formed \naround roleplaying and it is imperitive that you can do so to join this clan. \nIf you are a non-goblin then you may have to prove yourself worthy of \nprotecting the Goblins, because it would be a horrible thing if we recruited \nthe weak for this task.\n\nLONG LIVE THE LEGION!\n~\n\n-1 ELCRIC~\nThe Clan Circle\n\n    \"As one I am weak, but as many we are strong.  We are the Keepers of\nMagic.  We are the Magi of Clan Circle, Never Ending and Ever Lasting.\"\n\n    Magic.  It is the lifeblood of the universe.  It is magic that drives\nus, and it is in magic that we find true power.  This is the founding belief\nof clan Circle.  Through magic, any problem can be solved, any obstacle over-\ncome.  The main goal of Circle is to encourage and foster the development\nand increased use of magic, through the use of our own magic, power, and\nstrength.\n\n    The members of Clan Circle reside in the Tower, a massive building in \nwhich we work our spells.  Members of Circle receive free spell-ups, enchants,\ncorpse retrievals, and all of the other benefits that one would expect from a\nclan.  Although all clan members are expected to be willing to help others,\nthe Mentors of Circle are dedicated to this task.  The Guardians of Circle \nare the clan's military force, ready to fight at a moment's notice, and\nwilling to sacrafice their lives in defense of our ideals, members, and magic.\n\n    Roleplaying is *not* required to join Circle.  The only roleplaying\nthat is asked of all members is that you keep your characters seperate, as per\nthe basic \"no multiplaying\" rule of MHS.  We do encourage members to roleplay\nand develop their characters, but we do not require it.  Tithing of income\nis also encouraged but not required.\n\nCircle Leadership and Law\n\n    Circle is overseen by the Conclave, a council of 7 leaders who are\nelected or appointed from the clan.  There are very few defined rules in \nCircle.  We are a clan, we are Magi, we are family.  All members of Circle\nare given as much personal freedom as possible, and in return, we expect \nthat all members take responsibility for their actions, words, and beliefs.\n\nJoining Circle\n\n    Any race or class can join Circle.  Although our specialty is magic,\nand we generally only actively recruit mages and clerics, warriors and thieves\nare welcome to apply for admission.\n\n    The is only one requirement to join Circle.  Mages and Clerics must\nhave at least 8 spell groups, and Warriors and Thieves must have at least 3.\nBecause dragons are very difficult and timely to advance, the draconian spells\nare considered a spell group for the purpose of meeting this requirement.\n\n    If you wish to join Circle, talk to a Recruiter.  Any Inner Circle\nor Outer Circle is also a Recruiter.  If no recruiter is available, then post\na note to Circle, informing us of your race, class, and current level.  All\napplicants will be given a thorough interview, and some will be asked to \ncomplete a quest.\n\n                                  - Clan Circle, Never Ending, Ever Lasting\n~\n\n-1 LONER~\nLoners are individualists, standing alone from any Clan, but subject\nto the same rules as clanners with respect to pkilling, pstealing,\nand transportation spells.  By definition, Loners have no common\nhall, no leaders, and no affiliation among each other, save what they\nagree upon for themselves.\n\nTo become a Loner simply issue the 'loner' command between levels 5\nand 20.  This command -cannot- be reversed under any circumstance.\nDo it carefully.\n~\n\n-1 ECNALAB~\nIn life there are those who take, those who give, those who lead and\nthose who follow.  Seldom are they one and the same, but this is the\nland of Boinga, the land where the beautiful princess Alia once\nstepped. She had a vision, a vision of a family where to lead and to\nfollow to give and to take were equally respected by all who were\npart of the family of BALANCE.\n\nIn the days when Alia walked among us we were happy, at peace and\nable to console ourselves that we were no-one's master and no-one's\nslave. But Alia left this realm and chaos ensued. We strived to\nbecome what she had taught us and when we achieved it she did walk\namong us again.  Dissention was rife and soon after her visitation\nBalance fell under internal turmoil and deceit; the few feeling\nthat they took precedence over the many...\n\nAnd so this continued until one day few were left. They decided\nto make their own way and live the teachings of Alia rather than\nfollow them, throwing scorn on the likes of Riders those who would\nhave sheep rather than friends.\n\nWith that Balance was reborn!\n\nBalance is a family of members, none being any more important than\nany other. We strive for total equality and are in a constant\nstate of war with Riders, who see some fit to be ranked far above\nothers.  To join Balance just speak to any full member and they\nwill give you an interview (or arrange one for later). A full member\nis one who has been in the clan for 6 levels (or 20 days at 51). This\nis so new members have time to learn the ways of Balance before \ncompleting entrance into our clan.\n\nThe Current Speaker of Balance is Rigger.\nThe speaker of Balance is the person who is elected to be the\nspokesperson to the outside world.\n~\n\n-1 ESIMED~\nChildren of Demise\n\n        Darkness swallows light, death extinguishes life, and hope is but a \nfoolish dream. All things must come to an end, and the Children of Demise\nfaithfully help the end come quicker. We willingly bear the burden of life,\nso we can help the unbelievers on into the everlasting darkness. To enter\nthe darkness serving the faith is the greatest priviledge. To crush all\nhope and happiness is one the many steps to our eventual success.\nI, Eiji, am the father of Demise. I have come forth from the shadows to bring\nthe words and wisdom of Demise. There is no stopping our tide. We shall \nprevail.\n\nClan Demise\n\n        Clan Demise consists of a cult with a inner hierarchy. You rank\nis based on your level, your acts in the name of Demise, and your Role-\nplaying. Clan Demise allows pking, pstealing, and other cruel activities.\nWe work together as a tight unit, planning carefully all ventures.\nIf thou wishest to join Demise, expect a serious questioning from members.\nThey tolerate no stupidity, foolhardiness, or insolence.\nROLE-PLAYING is a MUST.\n~\n\n-1 DEMISE~\nAbove, in the planes of the Deities lies one of true evil.

We bare the burden of life to crush all hope and extinguish all life, \nmaking Cthon ever so much stronger! \n\nThose within our ranks have the privilege of serving the greatest evil.  As such\nCthon himself grants the elite army with speed and aura of fear that makes \nour enemies cower in fear with our power!  Possessing so much power we \nharness it and war with every existing clan, loner and outcast.  No treaty or \nbond between clans is powerful enough to stop our storm,  for we come for \nyou?always. In the words of wisdom of Eiji, the father of Demise, \"There is no\nstopping our tide! We shall prevail!\"\n\nClan Demise\n\nTo enter Clan Demise is a feat in itself.  Do not come looking for us.  We \nwill come to you.  Show us your power by killing and looting.  Any attack \non you consider it a test.  You must also be a minimum of level 15, and  \neven then, when we feel you are ready you fill be asked to join and no \nsooner.\n\nClan Demise is a cult of inner hierarchy, in which your rank is on the basis\nof your level,  your acts in demise, and other cruel activities.  If you do not\nmaintain your power and skills you will be outcasted and hunted by your \nformer clan.  No stupidity, foolishness or insolence is allowed, and  \nrole-playing is a must.  \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You must have a Thug or Killer flag\n\nDemise Charter (rules)\n{YGROUPING{x or {YWORKING{x with anyone outside the clan is *expressly* \nforbidden!

Teachers, Warriors, Healers, Sages, Young and old\nalike, they bind together under one holy creed. Seeking out the false\nfaiths and their unholy prophets, they continue steadfastly to cleanse\nthe lands of the evil that has spawned within the hearts of pagan\nmen.\n\nThese children of the Almighty, from all walks of life, are bound\nheart, mind, and soul to a common purpose, and a common name:\n\nZealot.\n\nThe faithful of the Almighty have but one purpose:  to annihilate the\nfalse faiths of the lands through any means necessary.\n\nNoone shall be considered neutral.

[*]\nThe members of the light are entrusted with the task of spreading\nthe teachings of the Almighty. They proclaim his holy glories to\nthe heathen nations, distribute holy scripture, heal and aid fellow\nbrethren in the congregation. They aid in the equipping and teaching\nof new recruits of the Almighty's Church. They may also aid in the\ncleansing of heathens or errant pledges, but this is not required.\nThey also aid the recruiters in bringing new recruits into the clan.\n\n/2 The Hand of the Almighty. [!]\nThe members of the hand concentrate their skills to the task of\neliminating false prophets and heathens. They seek out the heathen\nfilth and send their souls to the light via a bloodshed cleansing.\nThe creed: \"There is no forgiveness of sin without the shedding of\nblood.\" is very dear to them, and each has taken this crusade to\nheart. They also may aid in the gathering of new recruits, but this\nis not their main task.\n\n/3 The Crown of the Almighty. [^]\nThese members seek to enforce clan policy through intervention\nwhen the recruiters or the Anointed are unavailable. They report\ndirectly to the Anointed any violation that they witness within the\ncongregation, and are appointed only by the Anointed. Their prime\ntasks are the purging of false pledges, and to aid in collection of\nfunds of the clan.\n\nAll Ranks: Inquisitors.\nDue to vile forces of greed and lust, power struggles within the\nclan are all too frequent. The Inquisitors seek out those within\nthe clan whose faith in the Almighty and whose loyalty to the Anointed\nare weak or insubordinate. They report to the Grand Inquisitor or\ndirectly to the Anointed, who then deliberate on any action which\nmight be necessary to quell the disturbance. Who is an inquisitor?\nThat knowledge is only kept by the Grand Inquisitor and by the Anointed.\nAll inquisitors are chosen by the Grand Inquisitor or the Anointed. Any\ninquisitor who exposes his status can expect to have it revoked at best,\nor become an outcast at worst.\n\nRanks 1-3 are considered equal in all aspects, and shall be treated\nas such. No one rank is superior to the other, and should not become\nboastful over his brothers. Such boasting breeds intolerance and resentment,\nand is highly frowned upon.\n\n/4 The Preacher of Light, The Hand of Destruction, The Crowning Glory\nThe Holy Scribe, The Grand Inquisitor, Protectors of the Faith.\nThese select positions are hand picked by the Anointed, and given\nresponsibility of recruiting, as well as tending to their own\nbranch affairs. None possesses any rank above the other, and all report\ndirectly to the Anointed. These members also collect funds from the\nclan.\n\n/5 The Anointed of the Almighty.\nThese chosen children of the Almighty oversee all that happens within\nthe church of the Almighty. These people are said to be the direct\nvoice of the Almighty, and obediance of their decrees is required.\nThese people have complete control of the congregation, but may seek\nadvice on internal matters as they so choose.\n~\n\n\n\n-1 POSSE~\nA band of evil beings roamed the lands, spreading fear and chaos,\nkilling, looting, and bringing havoc to the world.  Within this band\nwere a few consumed with guilt, which could no longer bear the screams\nand death cries of the fallen.  Straying from their evil ways, they\nformed a Posse.\n\nThe Posse would no longer stand by and let criminals walk freely about\nthe world.  Thus, Posse attacks all KILLERS, THIEVES, THUGS, and\nRUFFIANS.  In doing so, Posse has made a few enemies along the way.\n\nPosse does not wage war upon any clan.  We strive to kill all KILLERS,\nTHIEVES, THUGS, and RUFFIANS, dealing swift justice where possible.\nTaking this into account, no member of Posse is to carry any of the \nabove flags, with the exception of the Ruffian flag.  We are of the\nunderstanding that sometimes excessive force is necessary, and also\nthat accidents _do_ happen.  Should other flags occur, each such incident\nwill be judged on its merits.  As a general rule, Thug flags are usually\nunacceptable at best and Killer and Thief flags are almost always an\noutcastable offense.  Exceptions can be made for bugs and extenuating\ncircumstances, again as the situation dictates.\n\nWe are not a group of individuals, we are a Clan family of sorts, in that\nwe help each other out whether it be pkilling, eq, grouping, spell-ups, \nor even just to sit and talk.  We do not group with those that carry\nflags, but will deal with them for goods if it is for the good of our\ngreater cause and they are deemed trustworthy enough to do so.\n\nPosse consists of those who are Good, Neutral, and Evil.  All races\nand classes are considered in joining, but we do not accept just anyone.\nPlayers are urged to talk to a recruiter at an early age/level as to\nnot invest too much time into a character who will be turned down.\nTeamwork is a _must_, as is clan/pkill experience.  Roleplaying is not\nrequired.\n\nSanctions will be handed out to those members of posse who have trouble\nfollowing the posse charter. These can be given by both /4s and /5s and\nwill generally last for the duration of your flag. However, if the /4 or /5\nyou ask to remove you sanction feels that you have not yet served your time\nthey will post a note to the clan stating why they feel that way and how\nlong they feel you should keep the sanctions. It will then be upto a /5 to\nremove the flag. Sanctions will be handed out as follows:\n\nRuffian - Skill, Store, Portal Room, Regen, Healer\nThug - Healer, Regen, Skill, Store, Portal Room, Hall for 1 week.\nKiller and Thief - Immediate outcast, no questions asked. \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You may not have a flag (see definition below).\n\nPosse Charter (rules)\n\n- any member of any clan that carries a flag (Killer, Thief, Thug or Ruffian),\n  is to be killed.\n- No member of Posse may carry any flag. Carrying a flag is grounds for \n  sanctions. The worse the flag the worse the sanctions.\n- Grouping with or helping any member of any clan with any flag is forbidden.\n~\n-1 SREDIR REDIR~\nAnd when He opened the seal there went out a horse that was red, and power was\ngiven unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that its\ninhabitants should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great\nsword...\n\nAnd behold there came forth an ashen horse, and he that sat upon him had a pair\nof balances in his hand; with a measure of wheat on one side and a mound of\ndust on the other.  And the power was given unto him to steal that which\nnourishes the body--and the spirit...\n\nAnd lo a black horse then appeared, and he that sat upon him bore a bow whose\narrows flew across the sky as an infectious cloud; and unto him the power to\ndisfigure and drain away the life of Man was given...\n\nAnd behold a pale horse arose; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell\nfollowed with him...\n\nAnd power was given unto them over the four parts of the Earth; to kill with\nthe Sword, and with Hunger, with Disease, and with Death...And lo there was a\ngreat earthquake; and the Sun became as black as sackcloth, and the Moon became\nas blood, and the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth...\n\nFor when the great day of His wrath has come...who shall be able to stand?\n\nMAKE WAY FOR THE APOCALYPSE...\n\n[Premise]\nWe are a lawful organization constrained by the inevitability of the End; we\nare but harbingers of the coming Apocalypse.  We do not seek out conflict or\ndestruction, nor do we believe in pkilling and pstealing with impunity.  Our\npurpose is not to bring about the End but rather to facilitate what inevitably\nmust, and will be.\n\nThose who wish to become minions of the Apocalypse must request an audience\nwith the proper Incarnation.\n\nWarriors should direct their requests for membership to WAR.\nThieves should direct their requests for membership to FAMINE.\nClerics should direct their requests for membership to PESTILENCE.\nMages should direct their requests for membership to DEATH.\n~\n\n-1 OUTCAST OUTCASTS~\nOutcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They\nare, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in\ntheir lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are\na few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:\n\n-- Attacking a fellow clan member\n-- Stealing from a fellow clan member\n-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan\n-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership\n-- Receiving a DWEEB flag\n-- Spying for another Clan\n-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention\n\nOnce someone has been Outcast, they may not rejoin another clan unless\na voucher is purchased, these cost 50eggs. \n\n~\n\n-1 DWEEB~\nDweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the\ngods themselves.  A Dweeb is given no safe haven, as they are allowed to be\nattacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can\nbestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for\na Dweeb flag:\n\n-- Continually spamming the public channels.\n-- Continually harrassing particular players.\n-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.\n-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.\n-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.\n-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.\n-- Using CB lingo on public channels\n-- Using l33t speak on public channels\n   (You don't look cool, you look like an idiot.  Real hackers don't use\n    it.  Quit watching TechTV.)\n\nNote that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings\nbefore you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to\nhave done something truly horrendous.\n\nAlso, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the\nperiod of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you\nmust live with it.\n~\n\n-1 MATOOK~\nHelp 'Matook'\nMatook is an organized group of characters that have shown interest\nin dedicating their time to helping out other individuals as they\ncan.  This can involve spell ups, retrieving equipment, corpse\nretrievals, enchantments, and other miscellaneous  tasks that the\nindividual is willing to do.\n\nThe helpers of Matook gathered together and created a Grand Church\nin the North-Western Corner of Midgaard. Here in the Church many\nhelpful souls can be found, as well they have provided fast healing\nand mana recouperation rooms for the needy.\n\nIf you believe in yourself to follow the ways of Matook and wish to\njoin their order be prepared to give an example of your skill and\nknowledge of Boinga.  You will be directed to speak with a member of\nthe Council who will bestow a quest upon you. Any Matooker will be\nwilling to answer any further questions about the the Church in\ngeneral and please don't be shy to ask for some assistance in any\narea. Of course, since Matookers are non-clanners, clan interference\nis always forbidden.\n\n\"One cannot love with anger and hate for fear will always ruin one's\nfate...To live a life full of peace one must love or see it decrease.\"\n\n-May Matook Protect You.\n\n~\n\n-1 DONATION DONATIONS~\n\nThe DIKU liscence states that I can not take any money from anyone \nplaying MHS.

This character has\nnot yet been refreshed. If you 'continue' you will go through parts of the\ncreation process allowing you to change parts of your character to better\nbalance you within the game. If you 'quit' this character remains unrefreshed\nand you can do it at another time.\n\nYou can test pfreshing a character by logging into the OLC Port instead of\nhere with this character. Login to sled.moosehead.com port 8080. Once you\npfresh a character on port 4000 you can not undo or retry it.\n\nIf you have any questions as to what this process involves we recommend\n'quit' and create a new character and read 'help pfresh' once you are in\nthe game and ask questions of the other players and Immortals.\n~\n\n52 JOBS~\nAs an Immortal on MHS, there are certain things expected of you, and\nespecially as a newer immortal, you should be mindful of exactly what\nit is you're supposed to be doing.  Below is a short summary of what's\nexpected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.\n\nNote:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.\n\nAll levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is\ncheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of\na higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings\nwith mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as\nyou would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of\nan Immortal.\n\n52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive\nor have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,\nsave to follow the same rules as everyone else.\n\n53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an\nImmortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how\nyou act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if\nyou are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be\nplaced at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the\nrules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the\nland, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of\nbeing an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob\nstrength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking\nquestions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.\n\n55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available\nto you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'\nstage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level\nwhere you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be\ngiven a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations\nat this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn\nOLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.\nYou have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any\nmajor decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced\nImmortal.\n\n57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to\nImmortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used\nto penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you\nshould have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,\nand a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at\nthis level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,\nbuild on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.\nYour conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but\nyou're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'\nonce you've reached this point.\n\n58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp\nof the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any\nsituation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to\nSenior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some\nof the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all\nImmortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected\nfor their dedication to MHS.\n\n59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still \nkeeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have\ntheir hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available\non MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,\nyou have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,\nor you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure\nabout, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS\ninside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins\nare also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new\ncode for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.\n\n60 - Implementor.  If you need to be told what your job as an Implementor\nis, you should probably put down the crack pipe now...\n\n~\n\n-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~\nYou may kill other players once you join a Clan or Loner.  If they are \nmore than 8* levels below you, you can't do it.  If your intended victim\nis not in a Clan, again you can't touch them (unless they have a THIEF \nor DWEEB flag). You may steal from other players if they are not more \nthan 7* levels below your level, and in a Clan. For either of the above \nactions you will recieve a flag and may have trouble with guards in town.  \nAlso other players may get to attack you.\n\nThere are specific ways to get certain flags:\n(Tf) A thief flag is gotten for failing an attempt at stealing from a \n     player.  You may be attacked by anyone up to 12 levels above you\n     when you have this flag.  It can only be lost by dying to another\n     player while you have no other flags.\n(R)  A ruffian flag is gotten from initiating combat on an unflagged \n     player. This flag has no consequence except saving someone who \n     attacks you from receiving a flag.  This flag is lost by dying to \n     another player.\n(Th) A thug flag is received if you actually kill a player. This \n     enables people up to 10 levels above you to attack you .  This \n     flag is lost by dying to a player either 1 or 2 times depending \n     on the number of players killed as a thug.\n(K)  A killer flag is earned by killing 3 players without dying in \n     between. The consequence is that {YANYONE{x may attack you. \n     The flag is lowered to a thug flag upon death at the hands of \n     another player.  When attacking somebody who origionally isn't \n     able to attack you, that person gains the right to attack you \n     until they have killed you.\n\nIs it worth it?  You decide.\n\n~\n\n52 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~\n.\n                         **********************\n                         ** The Rules of MHS **\n                         **********************\n \n1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.\n    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.\n \n2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. \n    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,\n    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    \n    and softening up or altering mobs.\n \n3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.\n    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly\n    go there themselves.\n \n4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.\n \n5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.\n \n6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie\n    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items\n    isn't.\n \n7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT \n    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some \n    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels\n    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).\n \n8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you \n    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore\n    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.\n \n9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  \n \n10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal\n    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.\n\n11) Do not argue with level 59 or 60 IMM's.  You're wrong, just admit it!\n~\n-1 PUFF~\nNo plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --\nHe grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.\nCompiles and simulations grew so quickly tame\nAnd swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.\nCHORUS:\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\nPuff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails\nAnd mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.\nAll the student hackers loved that fractal Puff\nBut DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, \"Enough!\"\n                (chorus)\nPuff used more resources than DCS could spare.\nThe operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.\nA gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,\nBut Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!\n                (chorus)\n~\n\n-1 CLIST~\nThis is a list of currently active clans on MHS.  For more details,\nsee the clan's helpfile \"help <clan name>\"\n\nHonor: A group of noble warriors, united in a common cause against\n       the evils of Boinga.\n\nDemise: A clan of bloodthirsty killers, solely intent upon the\n        destruction of good.\n\nWarlock: A clan of spellcasters, devoted to the preservation and\n         purity of magic.\n\nZealot: A group of religious fanatics, intent on preaching the word\n        of their God, and converting nonbelievers by any means\n        necessary.\n\nPosse: A militia who charge themselves with the eradication of\n       lawbreakers.\n\nLoner: Not members of a true clan, these warriors venture forth\n       into the dangerous lands of Boinga, with nobody to rely\n       on but themselves.\n\nOutcast: Once members of a clan, they have either left their old\n         life behind, or been banished forever for bring harm\n         upon their former brethen.\n\nSee the appropriate clan helpfile for more information, or speak with\na clan leader or recruiter (denoted by a rank of /5 or /4, respectively)\n~\n\n-1 RULES~\nThese are the rules of MHS.  For other matters, use common sense.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at ANY God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be\n  tolerated.\n\n* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods\n  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.\n  Please MAIL these bugs to: cascadia@nventure.com\n\n* Seerated player stealing or player killing.  Clanned players will NOT\n  involve non-clanned players in player killing in any way.  Non-Clanned\n  players will NOT intentionally involve themselves in player killing.\n  This includes spelling up clanners so they can go pkilling, or who are\n  being pkilled themsleves.  Nonclanners also cannot stand near pfights\n  and take disarmed weapons or fallen stones.\n\n* Summoning mobs and sleeping them at other aggresive mobs is forbidden.\n  If you summon Papa to the Dees and sleep Papa, and a nonclanner or \n  clanner gates to Papa, expect to be punished.  If you want to use Papa\n  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other\n  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive. \n\n  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or\n  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie\n  without their permission still is illegal.\n\n* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.\n  This includes using a script away from your terminal.\n  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.\n  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you\n  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your\n  typing woes, not play your character for you.\n\n* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with \n  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters, \n  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1 \n  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under \n  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are \n  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that \n  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,\n  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special\n  privileges. \n  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know\n  who someone's \"alt\" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over\n  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are\n  seperate.\n\n* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait\n  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between\n  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait\n  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.\n\n* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.\n  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.\n  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.\n  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too\n\n (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from\n  a pfight then dont take it.)\n\n* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless\n  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with\n  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the\n  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.\n\n* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and\n  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for \n  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are\n  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that\n  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To\n  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob\n  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with\n  them do not help them level.\n\n* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to\n  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.\n\n* Channel \"spamming\" and personal attacks on someone over public channels\n  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to\n  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse\n  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,\n  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.\n\n* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly\n  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you\n  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised\n  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.\n\n* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave\n  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while\n  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill \n  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT\n  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.\n  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal\n  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less\n  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.\n\n  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)\n  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)\n  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go\n   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).\n \n* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be\n  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have\n  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to \n  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage\n  character shall be denied.\n\n* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow\n  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is \n  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.\n\n* Other rules for clanned players are found in \"Help Clan\"\n\n* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and\n  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent\n  to Boogums (cascadia@nventure.com) \n\n* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty\n  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for\n  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could\n  increase the duration of your penalties.\n\n* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.\n  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs\n  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when\n  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base\n  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on\n  the web that have posting boards for such thins, such as:\n  http://www.mudconnector.com/\n\n* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same\n  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break \n  these rules.\n\n* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you\n  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means\n  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in\n  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your\n  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are\n  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.\n\n* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential\n  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so \n  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing\n  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or\n  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts\n  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections\n  are logged and will be watched.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be \n  tolerated.\n\n* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor \n  do the PEOPLE who run the game owe you anything.\n\n~\n\n0 SUICIDE DELETE~\nUse the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be\navailable for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,\nand you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will\nreturn your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the\nfirst delete.\n~\n \n0 HEALER~\nThe healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some\nservices are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see\na full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To\nreceive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.\n~ \n\n\n-1 GAIN~\nThe gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has \nbeen found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:\n\ngain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned\ngain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost\ngain apply :  turns 10 skill points into one practice \n\nGain uses practices to gain new skills, spell groups, and kits.\nGained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total\nnumber of creation points. \n~\n\n52 CLONE~\nSyntax:\n  clone obj <object>\n  clone mob <mobile>\n  clone <name>\n\nThe clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile\nthat may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in\nthe same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is\npreserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or\nmobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  \nStrung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.\n~\n\n\n0 SKILLS SPELLS~\nThe skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list\nof available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in\norder of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)\nlisted where applicable.\n~\n0 'SKILL POINTS'~\nSkill Points are rewarded to you for using your various skills in a \ncombat situation.  You cannot \"spam up\" a skill and get skill points.\nYou need to actually get out and do stuff.\n\nThey may be converted with the 'gain apply' command at the appropriate\nguildmasters into practices.\n~\n\n0 OUTFIT~\nThe outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with\na new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), \ncourtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.\n~\n\n0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT FULLSAC~\nMHS uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting\ngold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:\n\nautolist  : list all automatic actions\nautoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles\nautogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles\nautosac\t  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)\nautoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room\nautosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members\nautoassit : makes you help group members in combat\nfullsac   : able to sacrifice containers with items inside\n\nTyping a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. \n~ \n-1 CLAN CLANS~\nThroughout Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common\ncause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the\nspread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.\n\nIn order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,\neither by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name\nof their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4\nbeside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as\nfollows:\n\nYou must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast\nof any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either\njoined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.\n\nOnce you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If\nfor some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you\nmust first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  After outcasting you must\npurchase a voucher (not a cheap item) to gain access into a new clan. \nAlso, be wary, for those who make frequent changes in their clan find \nthemselves clanless quickly.\n\nExpect to be full looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your\nlife miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, however with that said\nthere must be an appeal to your humanity. Understand how full looting some\none makes them feel. Yes you've had it done to you, yes its a part of\nthe game. Do you really want to have a hand in driving off the player base?\nFind better ways to enjoy the game, help people stay and play. The larger\nthe player base grows the more fun you'll have and the more targets you'll\nhave. \n\nSee HELP CLIST for a list of currently active clans on MHS, and a brief\ndescription of the purpose of each clan.\n~\n-1 PRICES PRICE~\nPrice upgrades for clans\n==============================================================================\nThe prices below are for clans only.

Here is how it works.  Each clan hall area and \nbranch hall area should have/get a copy of the existing guard mob.\nhte only difference is, you remove the sentinal flag from the mob.\nyou also need to add the stay_area flag as well.  The name of the \nmob should be changed to 'roaming blah blah blah' so for Demise it\nwoudl be 'roaming guard of cthon' or something like that.  that way\nwe can find them easily.

You may pay for \ntraining for your entire guard corps.  This training includes \nall guards on staff at your branch hall. Should decide to hire more \nguards, they will have the same level of training and ability \nas your existing corps.   Prices for training your guards or \nhiring new guards are found in the {YPRICES{x helpfile.\n\nClan leaders are responsible for the descriptions of the equipment, \nhowever stats and affects of the equipment has been predetermined \nand will be the same for all clans.  This is not negotiable or \nupgrade-able.  \n\nYou may have a maximum of 2 guards per room.\n\nA Guard Eq set consists of a helmet, a shield, gloves, a torso item,\nand boots.  \n\nBranch offices will be open to all clanners, that is\nwhy you have a guard, who will sound the alarm should an\nenemy invade your branch hall.\n\nYou will be provided one (1) one way door into your branch\nclan hall from the portal room of your Main hall.  To return \nto your main hall, you will have to use your traditional \nmeans of transportation.  The branch halls are nowhere, \nmeaning people scanning from outside your hall cannot see you. \nHowever, you will not be able to use scan from inside your \nbranch hall.

The entrance to \nyour branch hall is a secret entrance.    \n\nClan leaders can purchase upgrades and additions for their \nbranch hall, but remember, all clanners can get into your \nalls and have access to anything in there, so build wisely.\nPrices for additions to your branch halls are the same as\nthose in the \"help prices\" file.

DOTs use a special, faster tick\nthat kicks in every 10 seconds.  When this tick hits, the DOT runs its course,\ndoing damage to the victim.  Some DOT spells also do direct damage up front, but\nthis isn't a requirement of a DOT affect.  Most DOTs have no cure, but do low\namounts of damage, so low they often fall under the damage curve.  But for this\nvery reason, DOTs are also quite powerful, as they can do hundreds of points of\ndamage and none of it gets curved.  The cost is time, as a victim of a DOT can\nuse several tactics to reduce the effectiveness.  Most DOTs last 1-2 minutes \nand do gradually less damage as they go.  Many things affect how much damage\na DOT does, and none of those secrets will be divulged here.\n\nThe Shaman kit is the best in the game, having access to an elite corp of DOT\nspells in the 'disease' group.  No DOT can rival the power of these spells.\nOther, more mundane DOT spells exist.\n\n~\n0 $~\n\n#$\n","position":146059},"values":[]},{"section":{"name":"rooms","header":{"identifier":"header"},"tokens":[{"identifier":"id"},{"identifier":"title"},{"identifier":"description"},{"identifier":"areaNumber"},{"identifier":"roomFlags"},{"identifier":"sectorType"}],"subsectionTokens":[{"identifier":"healing","tokens":[{"identifier":"healingFlag"},{"identifier":"healingRate"}],"startDelimiter":"H"},{"identifier":"mana","tokens":[{"identifier":"manaFlag"},{"identifier":"manaRate"}],"startDelimiter":"M"},{"identifier":"other","tokens":[{"identifier":"otherFlag"},{"identifier":"value"}],"startDelimiter":"O"},{"identifier":"doors","tokens":[{"identifier":"door"},{"identifier":"type"},{"identifier":"keyword"},{"identifier":"locks"},{"identifier":"key"},{"identifier":"vnum"}],"startDelimiter":"D"},{"identifier":"extra","tokens":[{"identifier":"extra"},{"identifier":"title"},{"identifier":"description"}],"startDelimiter":"E"},{"identifier":"observation","tokens":[{"identifier":"target"}],"startDelimiter":"B"},{"identifier":"clan","tokens":[{"identifier":"clan"}],"startDelimiter":"C"},{"identifier":"stop","tokens":[{"identifier":"stop"}],"startDelimiter":"S"}],"isRepeatable":true,"endRepeatDelimiter":"#0","first":false,"data":"#HELPS\n\n0 ASSEMBLE~\nUsage:   assemble <part>\n\n    The assemble command is used to combine items with item_type \n\"PART\" to create a new item.

This delay grows shorter as\nthe Paladin ages and gains experience.\n\n~\n\n0 'CONE OF SILENCE'~\nUsage:  cast 'cone of silence' <target>\n\nThis spell, if it lands, will envelope the vicitm in a cone of \nsilence.  They will be unable to cast, chant, or use any of\nthe communication channels.\n\nThis spell requires a component.  The component can be found\non a certian dominatrix in the City of Thives.  If the casting\nof this spell fails, there is also a chance that it will fire back\non the caster, causing them to be wrapped in the cone.\n\n~\n0 BOUNTY~\nUsage:   bounty <victim> <amount>\n         bounty show\n\n    Bounties may be set by any clanner on any other clanner, even a \nplayer in your own clan.

The medium has no other\nskills or abilities.  The medium does, of course, increase his/her own\nregen as well, and at all times.\n~\n\n0 'WITCH'~\n\nWarlocks and Witches are two parallel kits.  They have the same skills\nand requirements.  One is for males and the other for females.  These\ntwo kits are for mages and wizards, and are combination offense-\nenhancement kits.  They receive five spells.\n\n immolate  :: A fire damage spell comprable to acid blast\n lacerate  :: The most damaging non-breath weapon spell in the game\n clarity   :: Enhances mana regeneraation\n\n arcantic alacrity :: Speeds up spell casting, even for offensive spells.\n arcantic lethargy :: Slows down spell casting for your enemies.\n\n Note that arcantic alacrity's affect will stack with spellcraft, \n making Warlocks and Witches the fastest spell casters in the \n realm.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF THORNS'~\nThis spell, available to Druids and Elementalists, causes attackers to\ntake a small amount of damage when attacking you.

This allows fences to\ntrade while invis or hidden.\nThis being said, the social stat is very important to them.\n\nSee also:  connive\n~\n0 'CONNIVE'~\nConnive is the skill used by a fence when selling goods.  It\nalso allows the fence to talk their way out of \"sticky\" \nsituations every now and then.\n\nSee also:  fence\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD BASH'~\nSyntax: shieldbash <Victim>\n\nAvailable to Warriors, Blademasters, Samurai, Paladins, Berzerkers.\n\nShield bash stuns your victim for 1 round, and makes spellcasting\nmore difficult for a brief period afterwards.\n~\n\n0 'SYMBOL'~\n\nThere are four Symbol spells.  They are available to clerics and\ncrusaders only.  Their whereabouts and purpose are unknown.\n\n~\n\n0 'HAMSTRING'~\nSyntax: hamstring <victim>\n\n  Hamstring is a specialized opening move for Rogues, Thieves, and\nAssassins.  Hamstring does not require any special weaponry, and it\ncan in fact be performed using only one's bare hands.  When successful,\nhamstring costs the victim moves, some DEXTERITY, and applies the slow\nflag.  Hamstring will also strip haste if it's there.  A hamstrung\nvictim will occassionally have trouble when moving from room to room.\nHaving high strength and constitution not only reduces this problem,\nbut helps to avoid getting hamstrung in the first place.  Hamstring's\nimpressive array of debilitative affects are countered by its short\nduration and the fact that it cannot be used in combat, meaning the\nthief must give up on an opening backstab to use this manuever.\n\n~\n\n0 'ACCLIMATE'~\nSyntax: c 'acclimate' <target>\n\n   Acclimate attunes the recipient to the ambient energy of his or her\nsurroundings, making him/her regenerate incredibly rapidly.  If the\nrecipient of this spell does *ANYTHING* or takes damage from almost\nany source, the spell will cancel.  The recipient must remain absolutely\nstill to receive the full affect.  Druids only may cast this spell.\nThe spell can only be acquired via spell pages.\n\nThe location of this spell page is unknown.\n~\n\n0 'RESEARCH'~\n\n   Research is the skill that mages uses to create new spell scrolls.\nThe higher the skill, the more likely the mage is to successfully\ncraft spell pages.  Research is given automatically to all Mages\nand Wizards.\n\n   Currently most spell research must be done at the public magelab\nin Midgaard, which has recently purchased a MageLab 2000 research kit.\n~\n\n0 'REGENERATION'~\nSyntax: cast 'regeneration' <target>\n\n    This is a restoration-over-time spell.  It lasts for about 4\nminutes and heals a small amount of hit points during that time.\nIt is available to clerics, crusaders, and any hybrids that could\nbe old class cleric.  This spell belongs to no group and must be\nfound on spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'CRITICAL HIT'~\n\n    Critical strikes are a feature that is only available to classes\nthat can be old class warriors.  These are Warrior, Blademaster, Samurai\nBerserker, and Paladin.  If you are one of these classes and you are\noldclass Warrior, you will automatically receive critical strikes.  They\ndo extra damage based on your level.\n\n   If you are not an oldclass warrior but are one of these classes, you\ncan buy the ability to have critical hits by taking the 'enhanced \ncritical' skill.  This will give you critical hitting ability akin to\na warrior's inate ability.  For warriors, this will improve your chance\nof landing a critical hit.  For all characters with 'critical strike'\nthe damage curve is softened slightly.\n\n  Two other specialized crits are available.  'Bludgeoning' works with\nbash weapons, and 'Cleave' works with slashing weapons.  Both give an\nadditional chance to land a critical strike.\n\n  Note that you don't have to take enhanced critical to use cleave or\nbludgeoning.  \n\n Example:\tCleric Paladin\n\tHas no natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit', he\nhas basic crit ability with a soft curve.  If he takes 'cleave', he\nhas better crit chance with slashing weapons, and regular crit chance\nwith all others, and a softer curve.\n\n Example:\tBlademaster\n\tHas natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit' he has\nbetter chance to land a crit plus a softer curve.  If he takes 'cleave',\nhe gets a REALLY good chance to crit with slashers, improved chance to\ncrit with everything else, and soft damage curve.\n~\n\n0 'ENHANCED CRITICAL' 'CLEAVE' 'BLUDGEON'~\nSee 'CRITICAL HIT'.\n~\n\n0 'SUNBURST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sunburst' <target>\n\n    Sunburst is a single-target offensive spell.  It deals LIGHT damage,\nnot fire, and as such it has the potential to blind the victim from the\nintense light.  Sunburst does slightly less damage than the spell 'acid\nblast,' which is part of the basic training of most Boingan mages.\n\n   The origins of the Sunburst spell are unknown.  Researchers have\ndetermined that it is probably usable by Wizards, Mages, and Druids.\n~\n\n0 'SONIC BLAST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sonic blast' <target>\n\n    Sonic Blast emits a wall of mechanic waves that slam into a target in\na concentrated force, snapping bones and causing pain.  Sonic blast does\nslightly less damage than the standard Boingan spell 'acid blast'.   It\nhas the potential to stun the victim for 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of\ncombat.\n\n    Nobody knows where this spell comes from.  A leading researching at\nthe New Thalos academy of magic has suggested that a renegade mage may\nhave escaped into Altirin and developed the spell there.\n~\n\n0 'ADAMANTITE SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'adamantite skin'\n \n    Available to Mages and Wizards only, 'adamantite skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as adamantite.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.  The pages must be researched at the public mage\nlab.  The formula for the adamantite page can be found at the same \nlocation as one of the ingredients.\n~\n\n0 'INCINERATE'~\nSyntax: cast 'incinerate' <victim>\n\n    Incinerate is identicle to the 'acid blast' spell, except it does\nfire-based damage.  Incinerate is available to mages and wizards only.\nIt must be researched at the mage's guild in Midgaard.  The formula\nto create the spell scroll can be found at the magelab.\n~\n\n0 'STEEL SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'steel skin'\n\n\tAvailable to Mages and Wizards only, 'steel skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as steel.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'DIAMOND SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'diamond skin'\n\n\tDiamond skin is available to Mages and Wizards only.  It\ntransforms the flesh of the caster to a diamond-like substance\ncapable of repelling all damage.  Each attack lowers the duration of\nthe affect until eventually it fades completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF FAITH'~\nSyntax: cast 'shield of faith'\n\n   This self-only spell is available to Clerics, Crusaders, Paladins,\nDruids, and Monks.  A shimmering shield of protection is draped over\nthe shoulders of the caster by his/her deity.  The shield will absorb\nthe next several attempts to injure the caster.  The number of attacks\nit absorbs depends on the casting level of the caster.\n\n    This spell belongs to no spell group.  It may only be learned via\nspell pages and the Ritual.\n~\n\n0 RITUAL~\nSyntax: ritual\n \n   The Ritual is a rite by which religious classes learn new spells.\n To perform the ritual, the caster must be holding a spell page that\n has a copy of the spell he wants to learn, and be in an Altar room.\n The better the Altar, the better the chance of the Ritual being \n successful.  Four main factors influence the success of the Ritual.\n A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Level help the caster perform\n the Ritual properly.  But the inherent complexity of the scroll makes\n it more difficult.  \n\n If the Ritual is successful, the caster will receive the spell in his\n 'practice' and 'spells' list, and it functions like a normal spell\n after that.  The scroll is no longer needed, and the caster will never\n lose the spell.  It can be practiced and used like any other spell.\n It does not belong to any spell group.\n\n The caster must meet a level requirement for using the scroll, which\n is generally far lower than the actual level of the spell.  Whether\n or not the Ritual works, the scroll will lose 1 use.  Most scrolls have\n only 1 use, but some lesser scrolls may have more.\n\n The Ritual only works for oldclass clerics.  Oldclass mages will have\n to use study command.\n~\n\n0 STUDY~\nSyntax:  study <scroll name>\n\nThis command only works if your oldclass is mage.  It does one thing:  \ncopy a spellpage.\n\nIf the study attempt  is successful, the caster will receive the spell \nin their 'practice' and 'spells' list.  Once you have enscribed it, the\nthe spellpage is no longer needed.  The learned spell can be practiced\nand used like any other spell.  It does not belong to any spell group.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, 'spell pages'\n\n~\n0 'SPELL PAGES'~\nSpell pages are special scrolls that are found throughout the land of\nBoinga.  They enable an oldclass mage or cleric to learn a new scroll\nwithout having to gain the scroll from a Guildmaster.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, study\n\n~\n0 'REMOVE DISEASE'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove disease' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It \nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Disease is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks disease-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on plague or other non-DOT disease spells.  Remove Disease will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Disease gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 'REMOVE POISON'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove poison' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It\nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Poison is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks poison-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on 'poison' or other non-DOT poison spells.  Remove Poison will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Poison gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 SURNAME~\nSyntax:\tsurname <name>\n\n  Characters who have reached level 35 may select a surname.  This name\n  must conform to the same rules as first names.  You may have the same\n  surname as another character if you wish.  Nobody owns a surname, and\n  nobody has to have your permission to use yours.  Surnames can only be\n  changed by an IMMORTAL once set.  This is not normally done unless your\n  surname is inappropriate, or your character gets married and wishes to\n  take the surname of his or her spouse.  Surnames are only displayed in\n  your score and the who list,  and serve no purpose but for roleplaying \n  and fun.\n\n  You can toggle whether or not you see surnames in the who list by \n  using \"brief surname.\"\n\n~\n\n0 PREFRESH PFRESH~\n\nQ: What exactly is this prefresh I keep hearing about?\n\nA: Over the course of the almost 6 years MHS has been around, characters\n   have levelled under many different systems of gains.  In an effort to\n   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters\n   to \"refresh\" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that\n   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will\n   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years\n   and put everyone on a level playing field.\n\nQ: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?\n\nA: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you \n   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken\n   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all\n   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish\n   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation\n   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you\n   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.\n   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,\n   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.\n   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if\n   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal\n   creation.\n\nQ: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What\n   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after\n   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?\n\nA: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are\n   being discussed include giving out \"xp vouchers\" for the left over xp,\n   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally\n   decided, the answer will be posted here.\n\nQ: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?\n\nA: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through\n   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this\n   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc\n   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using\n   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can\n   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so \n   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.\n\nQ: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,\n   what good are they?\n\nA: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to \n   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you\n   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will\n   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices\n   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.\n\nQ: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.\n\nA: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending\n   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can\n   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills\n   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new\n   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that\n   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be\n   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it\n   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if\n   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.\n\nQ: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?\n\nA: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take\n   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the \n   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.\n\nQ: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my\n   practice sessions that way?\n\nA: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain\n   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up \n   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your\n   practice sessions.\n\nQ: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and\n   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?\n\nA: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your\n   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal\n   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,\n   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find\n   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.\n\nQ: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?\n\nA: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair \n   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all \n   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a \"stock\"\n   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly\n   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special\n   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special\n   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted\n   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of\n   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will\n   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.\n\nQ: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?\n\nA: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing\n   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we\n   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you\n   chose to change races.\n\nQ: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available\n   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?\n\nA: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and\n   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for\n   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes\n   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an \"old class\".\n   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level\n   and a few other things like delays on skills.\n\nQ: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?\n\nA: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the\n   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5\n   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,\n   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're\n   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will\n   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort\n   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.\n   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more\n   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be \n   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.\n\nQ: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want\n   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan\n   system?\n\n   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can \n   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be \n   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used\n   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader\n   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change\n   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,\n   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan\n   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).\n\nQ: What about my Mutant characters?\n\nA: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,\n   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not \n   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain\n   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once\n   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to\n   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you\n   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.\n\nQ: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I\n   think of something not covered in this help file?\n\nA: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had\n   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be \n   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that\n   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially\n   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding\n   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an\n   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either\n   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the \n   Admins.\n\nFINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of \n            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note\n\t    to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.  He'll consider\n\t    adding in your question if it hasn't already been answered.\n\n\n~\n\n0 MYRMIDON~\n\nMyrmidon\nConcept - The ultimate campaigner, the myrmidon is a classic soldier.\nThe military life is law to this kit.  Myrmidons live and die for the\nmartial life.  As a result of their rigid adherence to law and order,\nand the chain of command they tend to be strict and inflexible.\nHowever, the myrmidon is also highly trained in standard combat\nand is a skilled and powerful fighter.\n\nBenefits: \n* Specialization is free.  If the myrmidon has a specialization already\nwhen he picks up the kit, he'll be refunded the trains for it.\n* Because of their extensive training in basic combat prowess,\nmyrmidons, when using their specialized weapon, receive second\nand third attacks more often, anywhere from 125% to 150% depending\non the weapon skill percent and the myrmidon's level.\n* Also because of their extensive training, myrmidons receive a\nfourth attack skill.  With 100% in his/her specialized weapon\nand level 51, the myrmidon receives second attacks 75% of the\ntime, third attacks 50% of the time, and fourth attacks 25% of\nthe time.  These only apply with the specialized weapons.\n\nDrawbacks:\n* Because of their regimented martial life, these soldiers are less\nfamiliar with other fighting styles than their own.  As a result, they\nfight at a slight penalty when going up against creatures of a different\nsize (though not of a difference race if the race is the same size).\nThis penalty decreases as the myrmidon levels.\n\n~\n\n0 SPECIALIZE SPECIALIZATION~\nSyntax: specialize <weapon>\n\tspecialize help (displays this help file and costs)\n\nSpecialization is an option available to warriors and warrior reclasses\nSpecialization offers the warrior a better hitroll, more damage, and a\nremote shot at an extra attack.  Warriors and Blademasters may specialize in\nanything.  The warrior reclasses may specialize as follows:\n \n Samurai: sword, polearm, dagger\n Berzerker: sword, mace, axe\n Paladin: sword, flail, mace\n\nNote: In order to specialize, your oldclass must be warrior. IE a cleric\n      paladin cannot specialize, but a warrior paladin can.\n\n ~\n0 PAB 'PLAYER ADVISORY BOARD'~\nThe player advisory board (PAB) is an outlet for the coders to receive feedback about the major concerns for the game. Issues and suggestions brought forth by the PAB do not have to be implemented at all. Keep that in mind.\n\nEach clan will have 1 member on the board, usually the clan leader, but it can be anyone the clan decides to represent them. Clans can call for a change of representation at any time if the motion is supported by 3 different people, not characters. There will be 3 non-clanner positions on the board. Non-clanners will be appointed to the board by the immortal in charge of the PAB after having applied. These positions will be reviewed and possibly rotated on a monthly basis. Members of the player advisory board will receive an extra (PAB) flag by their name and be able to read notes posted to PAB. This will allow the other players to know who to talk to with their concerns. Being a member of the board is not something to be taken lightly, you will be required to post notes, attend meetings, and talk to the player base quite often.\n\nMeetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis. All other correspondence between the PAB will be through notes to all members, or through tells in order to come up with a working note to post. All members of the player advisory board will have their opinions considered, however the most popular idea will be the one that is sent on to the coders. Any questions about the PAB or its function will be answered by the immortal in charge of it at the time. No one else on the imm team is to be contacted concerning the PAB.\n\nImm currently in charge of the PAB: Hobkin\n\nMortals on the PAB have the PAB flag next to their names.\n\n\n~\n\n0 PYROTECHNICS~\n\nThe pyrotechnics spell group involves the creation of explosive materials.\nIts use is currently limited to samurai, monks and assassins. The spells \nare very powerful.\n\nsmall bomb: a small explosive device explodes on the target\nhigh explosive: blasts opponents with a larger bomb\nsmoke screen: obscures vision and allows an escape from combat\n\n**NOTE: Only Monks,Assassins and Samurai's get Smoke Screen **\n~\n\n0 NETHERMANCER NETHERMANCY FADE~\n\n   The Nethermancer is the most mysterious and unpredictable of spellcasters.\nThrough the art of {Cnethermancer{x, this kit can transfer hp to mana and vice\nversa as needed, at an exchange rate of 2::1.  This conversion is automatic.\nA perfect Nethermancer can only be destroyed when both his hit points and mana\nreach 0.  The Nethermancer also has a unique and uncontrollable ability to \nbecome completely invisible at will.  He cannot control when this happens and\nwhen it ceases, though he can force himself to become visible by engaging in\ncombat.  Nethermancers refer to this skill/annoyance as the {Cfade{x.  Finally,\nthe Nethermancer can bestow upon any weapon a special type of enchantment,\ncalled the nether flag.  What this does, nobody knows, and how the Nethermancer\nmanages to do it, nobody knows that either.  Nethermancers are automatically\noutfitted with a set of special robes.  If they lose their robes, they may use\nthe \"outfit\" command to get another set.  \n\nNethermancers cannot wear armor.\nArmor is defined as any item whose item type is armor.\n~\n\n0 BLADESINGER BLADESONG~\n\nSyntax: Bladesong\n        Bladesong stop\n\n   The Bladesinger is a special type of elf combatant.  Through the use of the\n{Cbladesong{x skill, the elven bladesinger receives a variety of bonuses in\ncombat, as well as up to a 25% chance for an extra attack during each combat\nround.  Bladesong can only be performed with a sword or dagger, and cannot be\nused if the bladesinger is wearing a shield.\n\n   Bladesong stop will end your deadly dance with the blades.\n~\n\n0 BATTLERAGER 'KILLING RAGE'~\n\n  The Battleragers are the elite corps of dwarven warriors.  Ragers are \nunstable at best, flying into insane fits of intense rage.  They can actually\ninflate their own hit points through the use of the {Ckilling rage{x, as well\nas receive a variety of other combat bonuses, including a chance at an extra\nattack during each combat round.  Battleragers can only perform the {Crage{x\nwhen wielding an axe, and cannot see their own hit point count while affected\nby the rage.\n~\n\n0 DAETOK~\n  Syntax: daetok\n\n  Dae'Tok is a Yinnish fighting style that cannot be learned by any other race.\nIt involves a style of trainin that Yinn are taught from childhood, and results\nin spectacular accuracy and maximum potential for damage with any form of \nweapon.  All Yinn become better with this skill as they advance in their\ncareers.  Dae'tok increases both the hitroll and damroll, and increases the\nchances of landing {Csecond{x and {Cthird{x attacks.\n\n~\n\n0 RANGERS~\n\n  The ranger is a master of the wilderness.  As such, (s)he fights most\neffectively in nature - plains, forests, hills and mountains, and is\nuncomfortable and ill-at-ease when indoors or in urban areas.  All rangers\nmay declare a species enemy (see {cSPECIES ENEMY{x), and will receive bonuses\nwhen fighting against any player or creature of that species.  The ranger's\ndislike of his/her species enemy is so strong that those creatures are \npenalized in defensive skills when defending against the ranger.  Rangers may\nmove from any sector to any sector for one movement point, and receive +3 \nmoves when they level.  They also may dual wield with any combination of\nweapon types.\n\nNOTE:  When the material table is complete, Rangers will be forbidden from\nwearing armor made from non-natural materials.  This means they'll be \nrestricted to leathers, cloth, wood, and the like.\n~\n\n0 'SPECIES ENEMY'~\nSyntax: species <race>\n\n   Rangers do not have to declare a species enemy, but the cost of this \nfeature is included with the price of the kits, they pay for it whether they\nuse it or not.  The species enemy must be a PC race.  Once you pick one, you\ncan never -ever- change it.  Select wisely.  Rangers fight remarkably well\nwhen going up against their species enemy, and members of that race don't\ndefend as well against the ranger.  You may not declare your own race as your\nspecies enemy.\n~\n\n0 'TUTINDEX'~\n\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n GETTING STARTED        Introduction to MHS\n TUT2\t\t\tPractices and Trains\n TUT3\t\t\tLevels and Rules Changes\n\n~\n\n0 'GETTING STARTED'~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n   Moosehead SLED is based on ROM2.3, so if you've ever played a ROM MUD,\nmany of these elements will be familiar to you.  If you are new to MHS or\nmudding, this file is designed to help you get started.  One of the first\nthings you will want to do is familiarize yourself with the commands.  The\n\"score\" command contains most of the relevent information about your character.\nThe \"worth\" and \"attrib\" commands show your gold/silver line and attributes\nlines seperately.  The \"who\" command lists all the characters that are logged\nin right now (that you can see).  Type \"equipment\" to see what gear your\ncharacter is currently wearing.  The \"inventory\" command lists the things that\nhave on you but are not currently using.  We recommend that you go through\nthe newbie school (type {crecall{x, {cup{x, {cnorth{x to get there) to get\na good head stat. \n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut2'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT2~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 2 \n\nTRAINS and PRACTICES\n   Your character improves by killing beasties and getting experience.  By\ngaining experience you eventually gain levels, which allow you to learn and\nuse new skills, spells, and abilities.  All new skills that you learn will\nbegin at 1% (except recall and scan, which start at 50%).  Although your skills\nwill naturally improve with use, you have to jump-start them by practicing\nthem.  A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will\neventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which\nthis happens is generally very low at low levels.  To practice a skill, you\nneed to locate a trainer (there is one in the Newbie school, follow the\nsigns to find him).  After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your\nclass to practice skills.  To practice a skill, you need to have at least 1\n{Gpractice{x session available (type {Cpractice{x to see how many you have).\nSimply type: {Cpractice <skill_name>{x, where <skill_name> is the skill\nthat you wish to practice.  Do not use quotes.  The skill you selected will\nincrease by a few percentage points.  The higher your {YINT{x is when you\npractice, the more your skills will increase with each {Gpractice{x session.\nThe highest a skill can go with manually practicing is 75%.  For anything\nbeyond that, you'll just have to use the skill and let it improve naturally.\nYou begin with 5 {Gpractices{x and you receive from 1 to 5 more every time\nyou level.  The higher your {YWIS{x is when you level, the more {Gpractice{x\nsessions you receive.\n\n   Your character also has 5 primary {Yattributes{x that summarize his or her\nabilities.  They are: {Ystrength{x, {Ydexterity{x, {Yintelligence{x, \n{Ywisdom{x, {and {Yconstitution{x.  See the individual help files for each \nfor detailed information on how they affect your character.  {YAttributes{x\nstart at a specific value depending on what race and class you selected. To\nimprove your attributes, you use a {Gtraining{x session.  You begin with 3\n{Gtrains{x and after that, you receive 1 more every time you level.  Your\n{Yattributes{x range from 3 to 25, and usually start out between 10 and 15.\nYou will want to train your {YCON{x and {YWIS{x first.  This action also\nrequires a trainer.  There is one in the newbie school.  These trainers are\nnot always the same as the {Gpractice{x trainers.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut3'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT3~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 3\n\nLEVELS and RULES CHANGES\n \n   As your character levels up, some of the game rules will change.  Also,\nyou'll be gradually forced to explore more the game world.  At level 6, you\nwill nol onger be able to enter newbie school, and must locate trainers in \nthe world somewhere.  Your character does not have to worry about the size of\nhis/her armor until level 11, and is able to use the {Crecall{x skill at will\nuntil level 11 as well.  After that, recalling requires the use of deity gifts\n(see {chelp deity{x), spells, or magic items.  The game will warn you about \nthese changes as you approach level 11.\n\n   When you level, it is in your best interests to wear what is called\n\"levelling gear.\"  Anything can technically be \"levelling gear\", but this\nterm generally refers to equipment that people only wear when they are about\nto level.  Usually this equipment gives you bonuses to your {YCON{x, {YWIS{x,\nand {YINT{x (see the helpfiles for each attribute for more information).\nWhere do you find levelling gear?  Ask around and explore, that is your best\nbet.  Note that when you level, the amount of experience that you need to \nreach the next level doesn't change.  Rather, you begin to gradually get less\nexperience for the same monsters.  You'll need to explore and find new monsters\nto slaughter that are more of a challenge.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut4'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 SPELLCRAFT~\n\n   Spellcraft is a special skill in which the spellcaster has studied\nthe metaphysics of spellcasting.  Those skilled with spellcraft are able\nto identify which spells other are casting, whether they are of the same class\nor not.  They also suffer a smaller mana drain when they loose concentration,\ncan sometimes cast a +1 over their normal casting level.  Spellcraft has a\nvariety of other, more subtle effects that make for a more solid \nspellcasting character.  This skill is incredibly difficult to increase.\n~\n\n0 BANKS BANKING DEPOSIT WITHDRAW~\nSyntax: deposit <#>\n        withdraw <#>\n\n   There is one banker in Midgaard, his name is Otho, he can be\nfound on clan road.  You may only deposit eggs into the bank, and they\nmust be in your inventory for you to do it.  Your total number of eggs\nin the bank is listed in your score.  You do not collect interest and \nthere is no minimum balance.  Your eggs are completely safe in the bank.\nNotice that unsavory individuals may hang around and attempt to steal your\neggs when you go to deposit/withdraw them.  The bank is not responsible \nfor stolen eggs.  \n\n~\n\n0 COLOR COLOUR~\n\n   Syntax based on Lope's standard colour code.\n\n   To enable color, type \"color on\".  To disable, type \"color off\".\n\n   This SLED automatically colorizes some elements of the game.  If you do\nnot like our colors, do not turn color on.  If you want to use only a few\nparts of color, get a client and utilize its color features.\n\n   You may use the following in any place to create color; notes, titles,\ntells, channel use, any where.  Please note that if you do not reset the\ncolor to 'normal', your color will bleed.  If you do this, you will be \nfrozen, so be very careful.\n\n    Red:    {{r for {rnormal{x, {{R for {Rbright{x\n    Blue:   {{b for {bnormal{x, {{B for {Bbright{x\n    Green:  {{g for {gnormal{x, {{G for {Gbright{x\n    Yellow: {{y for {ynormal{x, {{Y for {Ybright{x\n    Black:  {{D for {Dblack{x,  {{W for {Wwhite{x\n    Cyan:   {{c for {cnormal{x, {{C for {Cbright{x\n    Magenta:{{m for {mnormal{x, {{M for {Mbright{x\n    NORMAL: {{x resets colors to normal.\n     \n    Proper use of color:\n\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS{{x!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS{x!\n\n    Improper use:\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp>\n    {x\n\n    Get it?  If not, don't use it, please.  We don't issue warnings for\n    stupidity.\n~\n\n\n0 TRADE TRADING MUDTRADER~\nMudTrader 1.1\n\nSyntax: trade <cmd> <arg1> |amount|\n\nCommand Summary\n> trade request <character>\t \t- Start a trade \n> trade accept <character>\t\t- Accept a request to trade\n> trade decline <character>\t\t- Decline a request to trade\n> trade clear\t\t\t\t- Clear the current trade\n> trade cancel\t\t\t\t- Abort current trade\n> trade add <item in inventory>\t\t- Add something to the trade\n> trade add <gold|silver> <amount>\t- Add money to the trade\n> trade remove <item in trade>\t\t- Remove an item from the trade\n> trade remove <gold|silver> <amount>   - Remove money from the trade\n> trade show\t\t\t\t- Display current trade\n> trade approve\t\t\t\t- Finalize trade\n\nMudTrader is a special program that lets the MUD software act as a\nthird-party agent between two players who want to trade something,\nor purchase something from each other.  When you are trading, the money\nand items are removed from your inventory and held in memory.  If you remove\nthe items/money from the trade, leave the room, or cancel/clear the trade,\nyou get them back.  If you approve the trade, they go over to the other\nperson and are no longer yours.  When you are happy with the trade, type\n\"trade approve\" to finalize it.  BOTH traders must type \"trade approve\"\nfor it to work.  If anybody changes the trade, by either adding to it or\nremoving stuff from it, both people must type \"trade approve\" again.\n~\n\n-1 WIZLIST~\n\n        ________      ===============================      ________\n      /+_+_+_+_+_\\    |    The Gods of Moosehead    |    /+_+_+_+_+_\\\n      \\__________/    ===============================    \\__________/\n        |::XXXX|                                           |XXXX::|\n        |X::XXX|              Creator / IMP                |:XXXX:|\n        |XX::XX|               -----------                 |::XXXX|\n\t|XXX::X|        Rusty, The Oxidizing Dragon        |X::XXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|            Benefactor / Coder             |:XXXX:|\n        |XXXX::|               -----------                 |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|       Boogums \"BooglyDude\" McDugal        |::XXXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |:XXXX:|                                           |XXXX::|\n/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\                           /<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\\n\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/       Immortals           \\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\n       |.  /\\ . |            ---------------              |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Alagaster                 | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |               BriarRose  - ADMIN        |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |               KallaLilly                |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Karag                     | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|               Kuno - ADMIN              | . /\\  .|\n       | .//\\.  |               Slodhian - ADMIN          | .//\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       |.  /\\  .|                                         |.  /\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | .//\\  .|     Long live the memory of Mandrake    | .//\\  .|\n        \\. /\\  /         who left before his time.         \\. /\\  /\n         \\ /\\ /    [ IMMORTAL ] Grey Kellam : Mandrake      \\ /\\ /\n          \\/\\/                                               \\/\\/\n           \\/                                                 \\/\nArt by Blackstaff and Sara\n\nLast Updated By Boogums - 30NOV03\n~\n-1 HERO HEROES~\nThe list that follows is that of those who have attained the\nlevel of 52.

Here, anyone of level 52\nor higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the\nusual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;\nexamples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to\ncreation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,\nability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote\nplayers to immortality.\n\nSince immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)\na carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal\nbehavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without\nexplicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please\ndon't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or\nyou'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to\nthis file.\n\nThe duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,\nare topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are\nfraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)\n~\n\n-1 SOCIALS~\n \nThis is a complete list of socials for Moosehead SLED:\nCompiled originally by: Sara\naccuse       adjust      air          apologize     applaud     babble\nbark         bcatch      beckon       beer          bearhug     beg\nbird         bkiss       bleed        blink         blush       boast\nboggle       bonk        bounce       bow           brb         burp\ncackle       caress      charge       cheer         chuckle     clap\nclaw         collapse    comfort      comb          cough       cover\ncower        cringe      criticize    cry           cuddle      curse\ncurtsey      dance       daydream     drool         duck        embrace\nexplode      eyebrow     faint        fart          flare       flash\nflex         flinch      flip         flirt         flutter     fondle\nfrench       frown       fume         gasp          giggle      glare\ngoose        grimace     grin         groan         grope       grovel\ngrowl        grumble     hand         head          hiccup      highfive\nhop          howl        hug          hush          ignore      innocent\ninsane       judge       kiss         knee          laugh       lick\nlove         lust        massage      meditate      moan        moon\nmosh         mutter      nibble       nod           nudge       nuzzle\npant         passout     pat          peck          pie         pinch\npissed       plead       point        poke          ponder      pout\npray         propose     puke         punch         purr        ramble\nraspberry    rofl        roll         rub           ruffle      run\nscratch      scream      serenade     shake         shiver      shrug\nsigh         sing        slap         slobber       smile       smirk\nsnap         snarl       sneeze       snicker       sniff       snore\nsnort        snowball    snuggle      sob           spam        spank\nspit         squeal      squeeze      squirm        stare       stretch\nstrip        stroke      strut        sulk          swoon       tackle\ntease        thank       threaten     tickle        tip         tongue\ntwiddle      type        undress      view          wave        whine\nwhistle      wiggle      wince        wink          wonder      worry\nworship      yawn        yeehaw       yodel         rose\tlaces\ntank\t     starve\t aargh\t      homework\t    puff\tdiffer\nyae\t     lightbulb   voodoo       ogg\t    confused\tbeam\nbite\t     discodance  scuff        whap\t    lag\t\tchortle\nzerbert      twitch      roxbury\n \n~\n\n-1 MERC~\nThis sled is based on Merc 2.1, created by Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn.  \nMerc 2.1 is available as Merc_21.tar.gz from ftp.tcp.com and \nftp.math.okstate.edu.\nE-mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com' to join the merc mailing list.\n\nThanks to ...\n  ...

Their universal greed is the strongest bond between\nany of the existing clanners.\n  \nAvarice is a highly selective clan, who tends to keep its numbers\nlow.  The exclusivity is derived from the clan's lack of trust in\noutsiders, and a desire to have a large market that can be used\nin amassing great wealth in the name of the Avarice clan.\n   \nEntrance Requirements:\n -Must be level 20+\n -Must have the steal skill (above 75%)\n    \nAvarice's great power and wealth must be protected at all costs.  In order\nto ensure that only loyal members to the cause of Avarice are gulded, expect\ntests of your abilities and quests to prove your faithfulness if you\nchoose to join the ranks of Avarice.\n\nAvarice Charter (rules)\n    \n -You MAY attack anyone of a thief-based reclass (thief, rogue, assassin,\n  berzerker, monk)\n -You may NOT attack anyone who is not a thief-based reclass.\n  EXCEPTION:  You are allowed to attack to aid a clanmate who has\n    been attacked.

He was travelling the land and noticed that\nthere was power in the magical arts that was far beyond his or any others'\ncomprehension. He decided from that day forth to unite all pure spellcasters\nso as to fully understand and improve upon the arts of magic. He and his\nfaithful followers travelled the lands of Boinga to search out all those that\nhad the pure blood of magic in their veins. Those who would not join him and\nhis brethren were made to pay with their lives.\n\nHere we are left but a few proud spellcasters who have survived the trials\nof time. Now we shall rise again amongst the ashes of our ancestors. In our\nplight to truly unite the purity of magic, we have been forced to divide\ninto three sects.\n\nThose who adorn the White Robes of Warlock show the purity of magic through\nkindness. Their role in our clan is to guide all young spellcasters to gain\nknowledge of the magical arts.\n\nThose who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.\n\nThose who adorn the Black Robes of Warlock use the darker side of magic to\npunish the renegades who chose not to follow the true path, and defend our\nclan against those who would wage war. \n\nOur goals of the unity of pure magic has made us a very diverse clan, and for\nall those interested you may speak with any member of our clan and they will\nput you in touch with our recruitment officers.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements:\n  \n* You must be a pure spellcaster\n  (mage, cleric, elementalist, druid, wizard, crusader)\n   \nWarlock Charter (rules)\n*  You may not group with any clanner who is a:\n   Mage, Cleric, Elementalist, Druid, Wizard, or Crusader\n   They abuse the art and are to be killed on site.\n\n*  You may group with / help any nonclanner.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 RONOH~\n.\"It is a time of ideals,\n of leaders, of followers,\n of love, of friendship,\n of life, of death...\n of Honor.\"\n\nWE are the new generation of Honor clansmen and women.  Our forefathers\nbegan the quest for justice a millennia ago, on the plains of Northern\nMidgaard.  Blood and tears were shed to regain honor once lost.  In the end,\nClan Honor's strength in numbers allowed for victory, but at a great cost\nin lives.  The evil were caught, drawn, quartered, and hung.  They remain\nthere even today, as a reminder of the folly in betrayal, and the swift hand\nof vengeance.\n \nCLAN Honor's ideals come from the very heart of it's members.  We exist to\npurge this realm of the evil that exists in the minds and souls of many. We\nstrive to assist our own, especially in accomplishing the first goal.\nOur actions may not always be presented in the light of Good; although most\nwill agree it is sometimes necessary to combat evil with it's own devices.\n\nTO be allowed to join Honor, you must first send a note to 'Honor' stating\nyour intentions.  You will also be responsible for petitioning a Knight, \nEarl, or Lord to give you a quest.

They were a peacefull kind, only wishing to keep their \nrace going, raising cattle, and growing crops.  But as outsiders came to \nthe lands of the Goblins and tried to take over their farmland, it became \nobvious they would need some kind of defense, an army of some sort to fend \noff the newcommers.  And so was formed the Legion.\n\nThe Legion has one reason for being, and that is to keep the Goblins alive.\nIf you are a Goblin, and want to stand up for yourself in this world of\nraces far bigger then the Goblins, then the Legion is the place for you.\nThe Legion does not wish to seek out battle, we just wish to defend ourselves.\nAny race can join the Legion, but only a Goblin can ever hope to become\nanything more then just a guardsman.\n\nIf you wish to join the Legion, to help the Goblin race survive, you must\ncontact one of the leaders, or a recruiter, in a note or when you meet one\non-line. You must be able to roleplay, because the Legion is a clan formed \naround roleplaying and it is imperitive that you can do so to join this clan. \nIf you are a non-goblin then you may have to prove yourself worthy of \nprotecting the Goblins, because it would be a horrible thing if we recruited \nthe weak for this task.\n\nLONG LIVE THE LEGION!\n~\n\n-1 ELCRIC~\nThe Clan Circle\n\n    \"As one I am weak, but as many we are strong.  We are the Keepers of\nMagic.  We are the Magi of Clan Circle, Never Ending and Ever Lasting.\"\n\n    Magic.  It is the lifeblood of the universe.  It is magic that drives\nus, and it is in magic that we find true power.  This is the founding belief\nof clan Circle.  Through magic, any problem can be solved, any obstacle over-\ncome.  The main goal of Circle is to encourage and foster the development\nand increased use of magic, through the use of our own magic, power, and\nstrength.\n\n    The members of Clan Circle reside in the Tower, a massive building in \nwhich we work our spells.  Members of Circle receive free spell-ups, enchants,\ncorpse retrievals, and all of the other benefits that one would expect from a\nclan.  Although all clan members are expected to be willing to help others,\nthe Mentors of Circle are dedicated to this task.  The Guardians of Circle \nare the clan's military force, ready to fight at a moment's notice, and\nwilling to sacrafice their lives in defense of our ideals, members, and magic.\n\n    Roleplaying is *not* required to join Circle.  The only roleplaying\nthat is asked of all members is that you keep your characters seperate, as per\nthe basic \"no multiplaying\" rule of MHS.  We do encourage members to roleplay\nand develop their characters, but we do not require it.  Tithing of income\nis also encouraged but not required.\n\nCircle Leadership and Law\n\n    Circle is overseen by the Conclave, a council of 7 leaders who are\nelected or appointed from the clan.  There are very few defined rules in \nCircle.  We are a clan, we are Magi, we are family.  All members of Circle\nare given as much personal freedom as possible, and in return, we expect \nthat all members take responsibility for their actions, words, and beliefs.\n\nJoining Circle\n\n    Any race or class can join Circle.  Although our specialty is magic,\nand we generally only actively recruit mages and clerics, warriors and thieves\nare welcome to apply for admission.\n\n    The is only one requirement to join Circle.  Mages and Clerics must\nhave at least 8 spell groups, and Warriors and Thieves must have at least 3.\nBecause dragons are very difficult and timely to advance, the draconian spells\nare considered a spell group for the purpose of meeting this requirement.\n\n    If you wish to join Circle, talk to a Recruiter.  Any Inner Circle\nor Outer Circle is also a Recruiter.  If no recruiter is available, then post\na note to Circle, informing us of your race, class, and current level.  All\napplicants will be given a thorough interview, and some will be asked to \ncomplete a quest.\n\n                                  - Clan Circle, Never Ending, Ever Lasting\n~\n\n-1 LONER~\nLoners are individualists, standing alone from any Clan, but subject\nto the same rules as clanners with respect to pkilling, pstealing,\nand transportation spells.  By definition, Loners have no common\nhall, no leaders, and no affiliation among each other, save what they\nagree upon for themselves.\n\nTo become a Loner simply issue the 'loner' command between levels 5\nand 20.  This command -cannot- be reversed under any circumstance.\nDo it carefully.\n~\n\n-1 ECNALAB~\nIn life there are those who take, those who give, those who lead and\nthose who follow.  Seldom are they one and the same, but this is the\nland of Boinga, the land where the beautiful princess Alia once\nstepped. She had a vision, a vision of a family where to lead and to\nfollow to give and to take were equally respected by all who were\npart of the family of BALANCE.\n\nIn the days when Alia walked among us we were happy, at peace and\nable to console ourselves that we were no-one's master and no-one's\nslave. But Alia left this realm and chaos ensued. We strived to\nbecome what she had taught us and when we achieved it she did walk\namong us again.  Dissention was rife and soon after her visitation\nBalance fell under internal turmoil and deceit; the few feeling\nthat they took precedence over the many...\n\nAnd so this continued until one day few were left. They decided\nto make their own way and live the teachings of Alia rather than\nfollow them, throwing scorn on the likes of Riders those who would\nhave sheep rather than friends.\n\nWith that Balance was reborn!\n\nBalance is a family of members, none being any more important than\nany other. We strive for total equality and are in a constant\nstate of war with Riders, who see some fit to be ranked far above\nothers.  To join Balance just speak to any full member and they\nwill give you an interview (or arrange one for later). A full member\nis one who has been in the clan for 6 levels (or 20 days at 51). This\nis so new members have time to learn the ways of Balance before \ncompleting entrance into our clan.\n\nThe Current Speaker of Balance is Rigger.\nThe speaker of Balance is the person who is elected to be the\nspokesperson to the outside world.\n~\n\n-1 ESIMED~\nChildren of Demise\n\n        Darkness swallows light, death extinguishes life, and hope is but a \nfoolish dream. All things must come to an end, and the Children of Demise\nfaithfully help the end come quicker. We willingly bear the burden of life,\nso we can help the unbelievers on into the everlasting darkness. To enter\nthe darkness serving the faith is the greatest priviledge. To crush all\nhope and happiness is one the many steps to our eventual success.\nI, Eiji, am the father of Demise. I have come forth from the shadows to bring\nthe words and wisdom of Demise. There is no stopping our tide. We shall \nprevail.\n\nClan Demise\n\n        Clan Demise consists of a cult with a inner hierarchy. You rank\nis based on your level, your acts in the name of Demise, and your Role-\nplaying. Clan Demise allows pking, pstealing, and other cruel activities.\nWe work together as a tight unit, planning carefully all ventures.\nIf thou wishest to join Demise, expect a serious questioning from members.\nThey tolerate no stupidity, foolhardiness, or insolence.\nROLE-PLAYING is a MUST.\n~\n\n-1 DEMISE~\nAbove, in the planes of the Deities lies one of true evil.  His power is fueled\nby destruction and vengeance that are channeled through the wrath of his \nglorious children!  We are the Children of Cthon!  Spawns of Hell, Delivers \nof Death, Vengeance and Chaos.  We are the elite army of the greatest \npower.  We bare the burden of life to crush all hope and extinguish all life, \nmaking Cthon ever so much stronger! \n\nThose within our ranks have the privilege of serving the greatest evil.  As such\nCthon himself grants the elite army with speed and aura of fear that makes \nour enemies cower in fear with our power!  Possessing so much power we \nharness it and war with every existing clan, loner and outcast.  No treaty or \nbond between clans is powerful enough to stop our storm,  for we come for \nyou?always. In the words of wisdom of Eiji, the father of Demise, \"There is no\nstopping our tide! We shall prevail!\"\n\nClan Demise\n\nTo enter Clan Demise is a feat in itself.  Do not come looking for us.  We \nwill come to you.  Show us your power by killing and looting.  Any attack \non you consider it a test.  You must also be a minimum of level 15, and  \neven then, when we feel you are ready you fill be asked to join and no \nsooner.\n\nClan Demise is a cult of inner hierarchy, in which your rank is on the basis\nof your level,  your acts in demise, and other cruel activities.  If you do not\nmaintain your power and skills you will be outcasted and hunted by your \nformer clan.  No stupidity, foolishness or insolence is allowed, and  \nrole-playing is a must.  \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You must have a Thug or Killer flag\n\nDemise Charter (rules)\n{YGROUPING{x or {YWORKING{x with anyone outside the clan is *expressly* \nforbidden!

Let us pray...\"\n\nThe words of the Almighty are spoken, and his children wake, and listen.\nThese children are known for their devotion to the Almighty, the one\ntrue God of Boinga. Teachers, Warriors, Healers, Sages, Young and old\nalike, they bind together under one holy creed. Seeking out the false\nfaiths and their unholy prophets, they continue steadfastly to cleanse\nthe lands of the evil that has spawned within the hearts of pagan\nmen.\n\nThese children of the Almighty, from all walks of life, are bound\nheart, mind, and soul to a common purpose, and a common name:\n\nZealot.\n\nThe faithful of the Almighty have but one purpose:  to annihilate the\nfalse faiths of the lands through any means necessary.\n\nNoone shall be considered neutral.  All will fall before the might of\nthe Almighty!\n\nEntrance Requirements:\nNone\n\nZealot Charter (rules)\nYou may not group with or work with any other clanners.  They all\nserve false gods.  You may work or group with nonclanners as \ntheir gods have already been conqured by the Almighty and they are\nonly humoring themselves.\n\n~\n-1 'ZEALOT RANKS'~\n----------------------------Ranking----------------------------\n\n/1 The Light of the Almighty. [*]\nThe members of the light are entrusted with the task of spreading\nthe teachings of the Almighty. They proclaim his holy glories to\nthe heathen nations, distribute holy scripture, heal and aid fellow\nbrethren in the congregation. They aid in the equipping and teaching\nof new recruits of the Almighty's Church. They may also aid in the\ncleansing of heathens or errant pledges, but this is not required.\nThey also aid the recruiters in bringing new recruits into the clan.\n\n/2 The Hand of the Almighty. [!]\nThe members of the hand concentrate their skills to the task of\neliminating false prophets and heathens. They seek out the heathen\nfilth and send their souls to the light via a bloodshed cleansing.\nThe creed: \"There is no forgiveness of sin without the shedding of\nblood.\" is very dear to them, and each has taken this crusade to\nheart. They also may aid in the gathering of new recruits, but this\nis not their main task.\n\n/3 The Crown of the Almighty. [^]\nThese members seek to enforce clan policy through intervention\nwhen the recruiters or the Anointed are unavailable. They report\ndirectly to the Anointed any violation that they witness within the\ncongregation, and are appointed only by the Anointed. Their prime\ntasks are the purging of false pledges, and to aid in collection of\nfunds of the clan.\n\nAll Ranks: Inquisitors.\nDue to vile forces of greed and lust, power struggles within the\nclan are all too frequent. The Inquisitors seek out those within\nthe clan whose faith in the Almighty and whose loyalty to the Anointed\nare weak or insubordinate. They report to the Grand Inquisitor or\ndirectly to the Anointed, who then deliberate on any action which\nmight be necessary to quell the disturbance. Who is an inquisitor?\nThat knowledge is only kept by the Grand Inquisitor and by the Anointed.\nAll inquisitors are chosen by the Grand Inquisitor or the Anointed. Any\ninquisitor who exposes his status can expect to have it revoked at best,\nor become an outcast at worst.\n\nRanks 1-3 are considered equal in all aspects, and shall be treated\nas such. No one rank is superior to the other, and should not become\nboastful over his brothers. Such boasting breeds intolerance and resentment,\nand is highly frowned upon.\n\n/4 The Preacher of Light, The Hand of Destruction, The Crowning Glory\nThe Holy Scribe, The Grand Inquisitor, Protectors of the Faith.\nThese select positions are hand picked by the Anointed, and given\nresponsibility of recruiting, as well as tending to their own\nbranch affairs. None possesses any rank above the other, and all report\ndirectly to the Anointed. These members also collect funds from the\nclan.\n\n/5 The Anointed of the Almighty.\nThese chosen children of the Almighty oversee all that happens within\nthe church of the Almighty. These people are said to be the direct\nvoice of the Almighty, and obediance of their decrees is required.\nThese people have complete control of the congregation, but may seek\nadvice on internal matters as they so choose.\n~\n\n\n\n-1 POSSE~\nA band of evil beings roamed the lands, spreading fear and chaos,\nkilling, looting, and bringing havoc to the world.  Within this band\nwere a few consumed with guilt, which could no longer bear the screams\nand death cries of the fallen.  Straying from their evil ways, they\nformed a Posse.\n\nThe Posse would no longer stand by and let criminals walk freely about\nthe world.  Thus, Posse attacks all KILLERS, THIEVES, THUGS, and\nRUFFIANS.  In doing so, Posse has made a few enemies along the way.\n\nPosse does not wage war upon any clan.  We strive to kill all KILLERS,\nTHIEVES, THUGS, and RUFFIANS, dealing swift justice where possible.\nTaking this into account, no member of Posse is to carry any of the \nabove flags, with the exception of the Ruffian flag.  We are of the\nunderstanding that sometimes excessive force is necessary, and also\nthat accidents _do_ happen.  Should other flags occur, each such incident\nwill be judged on its merits.  As a general rule, Thug flags are usually\nunacceptable at best and Killer and Thief flags are almost always an\noutcastable offense.  Exceptions can be made for bugs and extenuating\ncircumstances, again as the situation dictates.\n\nWe are not a group of individuals, we are a Clan family of sorts, in that\nwe help each other out whether it be pkilling, eq, grouping, spell-ups, \nor even just to sit and talk.  We do not group with those that carry\nflags, but will deal with them for goods if it is for the good of our\ngreater cause and they are deemed trustworthy enough to do so.\n\nPosse consists of those who are Good, Neutral, and Evil.  All races\nand classes are considered in joining, but we do not accept just anyone.\nPlayers are urged to talk to a recruiter at an early age/level as to\nnot invest too much time into a character who will be turned down.\nTeamwork is a _must_, as is clan/pkill experience.  Roleplaying is not\nrequired.\n\nSanctions will be handed out to those members of posse who have trouble\nfollowing the posse charter. These can be given by both /4s and /5s and\nwill generally last for the duration of your flag. However, if the /4 or /5\nyou ask to remove you sanction feels that you have not yet served your time\nthey will post a note to the clan stating why they feel that way and how\nlong they feel you should keep the sanctions. It will then be upto a /5 to\nremove the flag. Sanctions will be handed out as follows:\n\nRuffian - Skill, Store, Portal Room, Regen, Healer\nThug - Healer, Regen, Skill, Store, Portal Room, Hall for 1 week.\nKiller and Thief - Immediate outcast, no questions asked. \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You may not have a flag (see definition below).\n\nPosse Charter (rules)\n\n- any member of any clan that carries a flag (Killer, Thief, Thug or Ruffian),\n  is to be killed.\n- No member of Posse may carry any flag. Carrying a flag is grounds for \n  sanctions. The worse the flag the worse the sanctions.\n- Grouping with or helping any member of any clan with any flag is forbidden.\n~\n-1 SREDIR REDIR~\nAnd when He opened the seal there went out a horse that was red, and power was\ngiven unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that its\ninhabitants should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great\nsword...\n\nAnd behold there came forth an ashen horse, and he that sat upon him had a pair\nof balances in his hand; with a measure of wheat on one side and a mound of\ndust on the other.  And the power was given unto him to steal that which\nnourishes the body--and the spirit...\n\nAnd lo a black horse then appeared, and he that sat upon him bore a bow whose\narrows flew across the sky as an infectious cloud; and unto him the power to\ndisfigure and drain away the life of Man was given...\n\nAnd behold a pale horse arose; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell\nfollowed with him...\n\nAnd power was given unto them over the four parts of the Earth; to kill with\nthe Sword, and with Hunger, with Disease, and with Death...And lo there was a\ngreat earthquake; and the Sun became as black as sackcloth, and the Moon became\nas blood, and the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth...\n\nFor when the great day of His wrath has come...who shall be able to stand?\n\nMAKE WAY FOR THE APOCALYPSE...\n\n[Premise]\nWe are a lawful organization constrained by the inevitability of the End; we\nare but harbingers of the coming Apocalypse.  We do not seek out conflict or\ndestruction, nor do we believe in pkilling and pstealing with impunity.  Our\npurpose is not to bring about the End but rather to facilitate what inevitably\nmust, and will be.\n\nThose who wish to become minions of the Apocalypse must request an audience\nwith the proper Incarnation.\n\nWarriors should direct their requests for membership to WAR.\nThieves should direct their requests for membership to FAMINE.\nClerics should direct their requests for membership to PESTILENCE.\nMages should direct their requests for membership to DEATH.\n~\n\n-1 OUTCAST OUTCASTS~\nOutcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They\nare, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in\ntheir lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are\na few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:\n\n-- Attacking a fellow clan member\n-- Stealing from a fellow clan member\n-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan\n-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership\n-- Receiving a DWEEB flag\n-- Spying for another Clan\n-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention\n\nOnce someone has been Outcast, they may not rejoin another clan unless\na voucher is purchased, these cost 50eggs. \n\n~\n\n-1 DWEEB~\nDweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the\ngods themselves.  A Dweeb is given no safe haven, as they are allowed to be\nattacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can\nbestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for\na Dweeb flag:\n\n-- Continually spamming the public channels.\n-- Continually harrassing particular players.\n-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.\n-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.\n-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.\n-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.\n-- Using CB lingo on public channels\n-- Using l33t speak on public channels\n   (You don't look cool, you look like an idiot.  Real hackers don't use\n    it.  Quit watching TechTV.)\n\nNote that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings\nbefore you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to\nhave done something truly horrendous.\n\nAlso, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the\nperiod of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you\nmust live with it.\n~\n\n-1 MATOOK~\nHelp 'Matook'\nMatook is an organized group of characters that have shown interest\nin dedicating their time to helping out other individuals as they\ncan.  This can involve spell ups, retrieving equipment, corpse\nretrievals, enchantments, and other miscellaneous  tasks that the\nindividual is willing to do.\n\nThe helpers of Matook gathered together and created a Grand Church\nin the North-Western Corner of Midgaard. Here in the Church many\nhelpful souls can be found, as well they have provided fast healing\nand mana recouperation rooms for the needy.\n\nIf you believe in yourself to follow the ways of Matook and wish to\njoin their order be prepared to give an example of your skill and\nknowledge of Boinga.  You will be directed to speak with a member of\nthe Council who will bestow a quest upon you. Any Matooker will be\nwilling to answer any further questions about the the Church in\ngeneral and please don't be shy to ask for some assistance in any\narea. Of course, since Matookers are non-clanners, clan interference\nis always forbidden.\n\n\"One cannot love with anger and hate for fear will always ruin one's\nfate...To live a life full of peace one must love or see it decrease.\"\n\n-May Matook Protect You.\n\n~\n\n-1 DONATION DONATIONS~\n\nThe DIKU liscence states that I can not take any money from anyone \nplaying MHS.

This character has\nnot yet been refreshed. If you 'continue' you will go through parts of the\ncreation process allowing you to change parts of your character to better\nbalance you within the game. If you 'quit' this character remains unrefreshed\nand you can do it at another time.\n\nYou can test pfreshing a character by logging into the OLC Port instead of\nhere with this character. Login to sled.moosehead.com port 8080. Once you\npfresh a character on port 4000 you can not undo or retry it.\n\nIf you have any questions as to what this process involves we recommend\n'quit' and create a new character and read 'help pfresh' once you are in\nthe game and ask questions of the other players and Immortals.\n~\n\n52 JOBS~\nAs an Immortal on MHS, there are certain things expected of you, and\nespecially as a newer immortal, you should be mindful of exactly what\nit is you're supposed to be doing.  Below is a short summary of what's\nexpected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.\n\nNote:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.\n\nAll levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is\ncheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of\na higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings\nwith mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as\nyou would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of\nan Immortal.\n\n52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive\nor have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,\nsave to follow the same rules as everyone else.\n\n53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an\nImmortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how\nyou act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if\nyou are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be\nplaced at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the\nrules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the\nland, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of\nbeing an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob\nstrength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking\nquestions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.\n\n55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available\nto you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'\nstage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level\nwhere you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be\ngiven a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations\nat this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn\nOLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.\nYou have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any\nmajor decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced\nImmortal.\n\n57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to\nImmortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used\nto penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you\nshould have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,\nand a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at\nthis level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,\nbuild on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.\nYour conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but\nyou're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'\nonce you've reached this point.\n\n58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp\nof the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any\nsituation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to\nSenior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some\nof the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all\nImmortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected\nfor their dedication to MHS.\n\n59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still \nkeeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have\ntheir hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available\non MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,\nyou have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,\nor you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure\nabout, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS\ninside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins\nare also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new\ncode for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.\n\n60 - Implementor.  If you need to be told what your job as an Implementor\nis, you should probably put down the crack pipe now...\n\n~\n\n-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~\nYou may kill other players once you join a Clan or Loner.  If they are \nmore than 8* levels below you, you can't do it.  If your intended victim\nis not in a Clan, again you can't touch them (unless they have a THIEF \nor DWEEB flag). You may steal from other players if they are not more \nthan 7* levels below your level, and in a Clan. For either of the above \nactions you will recieve a flag and may have trouble with guards in town.  \nAlso other players may get to attack you.\n\nThere are specific ways to get certain flags:\n(Tf) A thief flag is gotten for failing an attempt at stealing from a \n     player.  You may be attacked by anyone up to 12 levels above you\n     when you have this flag.  It can only be lost by dying to another\n     player while you have no other flags.\n(R)  A ruffian flag is gotten from initiating combat on an unflagged \n     player. This flag has no consequence except saving someone who \n     attacks you from receiving a flag.  This flag is lost by dying to \n     another player.\n(Th) A thug flag is received if you actually kill a player. This \n     enables people up to 10 levels above you to attack you .  This \n     flag is lost by dying to a player either 1 or 2 times depending \n     on the number of players killed as a thug.\n(K)  A killer flag is earned by killing 3 players without dying in \n     between. The consequence is that {YANYONE{x may attack you. \n     The flag is lowered to a thug flag upon death at the hands of \n     another player.  When attacking somebody who origionally isn't \n     able to attack you, that person gains the right to attack you \n     until they have killed you.\n\nIs it worth it?  You decide.\n\n~\n\n52 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~\n.\n                         **********************\n                         ** The Rules of MHS **\n                         **********************\n \n1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.\n    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.\n \n2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. \n    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,\n    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    \n    and softening up or altering mobs.\n \n3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.\n    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly\n    go there themselves.\n \n4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.\n \n5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.\n \n6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie\n    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items\n    isn't.\n \n7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT \n    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some \n    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels\n    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).\n \n8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you \n    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore\n    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.\n \n9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  \n \n10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal\n    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.\n\n11) Do not argue with level 59 or 60 IMM's.  You're wrong, just admit it!\n~\n-1 PUFF~\nNo plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --\nHe grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.\nCompiles and simulations grew so quickly tame\nAnd swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.\nCHORUS:\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\nPuff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails\nAnd mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.\nAll the student hackers loved that fractal Puff\nBut DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, \"Enough!\"\n                (chorus)\nPuff used more resources than DCS could spare.\nThe operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.\nA gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,\nBut Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!\n                (chorus)\n~\n\n-1 CLIST~\nThis is a list of currently active clans on MHS.  For more details,\nsee the clan's helpfile \"help <clan name>\"\n\nHonor: A group of noble warriors, united in a common cause against\n       the evils of Boinga.\n\nDemise: A clan of bloodthirsty killers, solely intent upon the\n        destruction of good.\n\nWarlock: A clan of spellcasters, devoted to the preservation and\n         purity of magic.\n\nZealot: A group of religious fanatics, intent on preaching the word\n        of their God, and converting nonbelievers by any means\n        necessary.\n\nPosse: A militia who charge themselves with the eradication of\n       lawbreakers.\n\nLoner: Not members of a true clan, these warriors venture forth\n       into the dangerous lands of Boinga, with nobody to rely\n       on but themselves.\n\nOutcast: Once members of a clan, they have either left their old\n         life behind, or been banished forever for bring harm\n         upon their former brethen.\n\nSee the appropriate clan helpfile for more information, or speak with\na clan leader or recruiter (denoted by a rank of /5 or /4, respectively)\n~\n\n-1 RULES~\nThese are the rules of MHS.  For other matters, use common sense.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at ANY God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be\n  tolerated.\n\n* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods\n  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.\n  Please MAIL these bugs to: cascadia@nventure.com\n\n* Seerated player stealing or player killing.  Clanned players will NOT\n  involve non-clanned players in player killing in any way.  Non-Clanned\n  players will NOT intentionally involve themselves in player killing.\n  This includes spelling up clanners so they can go pkilling, or who are\n  being pkilled themsleves.  Nonclanners also cannot stand near pfights\n  and take disarmed weapons or fallen stones.\n\n* Summoning mobs and sleeping them at other aggresive mobs is forbidden.\n  If you summon Papa to the Dees and sleep Papa, and a nonclanner or \n  clanner gates to Papa, expect to be punished.  If you want to use Papa\n  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other\n  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive. \n\n  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or\n  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie\n  without their permission still is illegal.\n\n* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.\n  This includes using a script away from your terminal.\n  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.\n  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you\n  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your\n  typing woes, not play your character for you.\n\n* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with \n  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters, \n  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1 \n  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under \n  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are \n  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that \n  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,\n  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special\n  privileges. \n  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know\n  who someone's \"alt\" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over\n  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are\n  seperate.\n\n* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait\n  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between\n  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait\n  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.\n\n* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.\n  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.\n  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.\n  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too\n\n (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from\n  a pfight then dont take it.)\n\n* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless\n  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with\n  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the\n  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.\n\n* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and\n  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for \n  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are\n  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that\n  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To\n  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob\n  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with\n  them do not help them level.\n\n* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to\n  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.\n\n* Channel \"spamming\" and personal attacks on someone over public channels\n  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to\n  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse\n  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,\n  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.\n\n* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly\n  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you\n  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised\n  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.\n\n* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave\n  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while\n  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill \n  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT\n  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.\n  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal\n  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less\n  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.\n\n  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)\n  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)\n  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go\n   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).\n \n* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be\n  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have\n  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to \n  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage\n  character shall be denied.\n\n* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow\n  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is \n  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.\n\n* Other rules for clanned players are found in \"Help Clan\"\n\n* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and\n  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent\n  to Boogums (cascadia@nventure.com) \n\n* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty\n  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for\n  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could\n  increase the duration of your penalties.\n\n* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.\n  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs\n  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when\n  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base\n  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on\n  the web that have posting boards for such thins, such as:\n  http://www.mudconnector.com/\n\n* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same\n  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break \n  these rules.\n\n* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you\n  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means\n  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in\n  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your\n  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are\n  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.\n\n* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential\n  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so \n  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing\n  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or\n  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts\n  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections\n  are logged and will be watched.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be \n  tolerated.\n\n* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor \n  do the PEOPLE who run the game owe you anything.\n\n~\n\n0 SUICIDE DELETE~\nUse the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be\navailable for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,\nand you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will\nreturn your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the\nfirst delete.\n~\n \n0 HEALER~\nThe healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some\nservices are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see\na full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To\nreceive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.\n~ \n\n\n-1 GAIN~\nThe gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has \nbeen found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:\n\ngain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned\ngain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost\ngain apply :  turns 10 skill points into one practice \n\nGain uses practices to gain new skills, spell groups, and kits.\nGained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total\nnumber of creation points. \n~\n\n52 CLONE~\nSyntax:\n  clone obj <object>\n  clone mob <mobile>\n  clone <name>\n\nThe clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile\nthat may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in\nthe same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is\npreserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or\nmobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  \nStrung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.\n~\n\n\n0 SKILLS SPELLS~\nThe skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list\nof available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in\norder of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)\nlisted where applicable.\n~\n0 'SKILL POINTS'~\nSkill Points are rewarded to you for using your various skills in a \ncombat situation.  You cannot \"spam up\" a skill and get skill points.\nYou need to actually get out and do stuff.\n\nThey may be converted with the 'gain apply' command at the appropriate\nguildmasters into practices.\n~\n\n0 OUTFIT~\nThe outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with\na new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), \ncourtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.\n~\n\n0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT FULLSAC~\nMHS uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting\ngold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:\n\nautolist  : list all automatic actions\nautoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles\nautogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles\nautosac\t  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)\nautoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room\nautosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members\nautoassit : makes you help group members in combat\nfullsac   : able to sacrifice containers with items inside\n\nTyping a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. \n~ \n-1 CLAN CLANS~\nThroughout Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common\ncause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the\nspread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.\n\nIn order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,\neither by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name\nof their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4\nbeside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as\nfollows:\n\nYou must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast\nof any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either\njoined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.\n\nOnce you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If\nfor some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you\nmust first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  After outcasting you must\npurchase a voucher (not a cheap item) to gain access into a new clan. \nAlso, be wary, for those who make frequent changes in their clan find \nthemselves clanless quickly.\n\nExpect to be full looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your\nlife miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, however with that said\nthere must be an appeal to your humanity. Understand how full looting some\none makes them feel. Yes you've had it done to you, yes its a part of\nthe game. Do you really want to have a hand in driving off the player base?\nFind better ways to enjoy the game, help people stay and play.

Each clan hall area and \nbranch hall area should have/get a copy of the existing guard mob.\nhte only difference is, you remove the sentinal flag from the mob.\nyou also need to add the stay_area flag as well.  The name of the \nmob should be changed to 'roaming blah blah blah' so for Demise it\nwoudl be 'roaming guard of cthon' or something like that.  that way\nwe can find them easily.  For roamers in the branch halls, use the \nbranch hall area.  Let's try an minimize cross vnumming.

To return \nto your main hall, you will have to use your traditional \nmeans of transportation.

DOTs use a special, faster tick\nthat kicks in every 10 seconds.  When this tick hits, the DOT runs its course,\ndoing damage to the victim.  Some DOT spells also do direct damage up front, but\nthis isn't a requirement of a DOT affect.  Most DOTs have no cure, but do low\namounts of damage, so low they often fall under the damage curve.  But for this\nvery reason, DOTs are also quite powerful, as they can do hundreds of points of\ndamage and none of it gets curved.  The cost is time, as a victim of a DOT can\nuse several tactics to reduce the effectiveness.  Most DOTs last 1-2 minutes \nand do gradually less damage as they go.  Many things affect how much damage\na DOT does, and none of those secrets will be divulged here.\n\nThe Shaman kit is the best in the game, having access to an elite corp of DOT\nspells in the 'disease' group.  No DOT can rival the power of these spells.\nOther, more mundane DOT spells exist.\n\n~\n0 $~\n\n#$\n","position":146063},"values":[]},{"section":{"name":"resets","header":{"identifier":"header"},"tokens":[{"identifier":"command"},{"identifier":"throwaway"},{"identifier":"args"},{"identifier":"comment"}],"subsectionTokens":[],"isRepeatable":true,"endRepeatDelimiter":"S","first":false,"data":"#HELPS\n\n0 ASSEMBLE~\nUsage:   assemble <part>\n\n    The assemble command is used to combine items with item_type \n\"PART\" to create a new item.

The victim will be notified that a bounty\nhas been raised on him/her, but (s)he won't know by who.  The bounty\nis measured in gold.  You MUST have the gold on you to set the bounty.\nBounties can be set anywhere at any time.  Bounties are cumulative,\nand will accumulate until the victim is slain.  They can never be\ntaken back.  You may place multiple bounties on the same person.  \nTo see who is logged on that has a bounty, type 'bounty show'.  The\nbounty will be automatically deposited into your 'gold' count once \nyou kill the victim.  There are some specific rules on bounties, see\n'help rules' for details.  Ignorance of these rules is no excuse to\nbreak them or the spirit of them.\n\n~\n\n0 'MEDIUM'~\n\n   The medium is a very simple kit.  The Medium is throughly connected\nto the physical world, and is able to enhance the regen of anybody in\nthe same room.

When successful,\nhamstring costs the victim moves, some DEXTERITY, and applies the slow\nflag.  Hamstring will also strip haste if it's there.  A hamstrung\nvictim will occassionally have trouble when moving from room to room.\nHaving high strength and constitution not only reduces this problem,\nbut helps to avoid getting hamstrung in the first place.  Hamstring's\nimpressive array of debilitative affects are countered by its short\nduration and the fact that it cannot be used in combat, meaning the\nthief must give up on an opening backstab to use this manuever.\n\n~\n\n0 'ACCLIMATE'~\nSyntax: c 'acclimate' <target>\n\n   Acclimate attunes the recipient to the ambient energy of his or her\nsurroundings, making him/her regenerate incredibly rapidly.  If the\nrecipient of this spell does *ANYTHING* or takes damage from almost\nany source, the spell will cancel.  The recipient must remain absolutely\nstill to receive the full affect.  Druids only may cast this spell.\nThe spell can only be acquired via spell pages.\n\nThe location of this spell page is unknown.\n~\n\n0 'RESEARCH'~\n\n   Research is the skill that mages uses to create new spell scrolls.\nThe higher the skill, the more likely the mage is to successfully\ncraft spell pages.  Research is given automatically to all Mages\nand Wizards.\n\n   Currently most spell research must be done at the public magelab\nin Midgaard, which has recently purchased a MageLab 2000 research kit.\n~\n\n0 'REGENERATION'~\nSyntax: cast 'regeneration' <target>\n\n    This is a restoration-over-time spell.  It lasts for about 4\nminutes and heals a small amount of hit points during that time.\nIt is available to clerics, crusaders, and any hybrids that could\nbe old class cleric.  This spell belongs to no group and must be\nfound on spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'CRITICAL HIT'~\n\n    Critical strikes are a feature that is only available to classes\nthat can be old class warriors.  These are Warrior, Blademaster, Samurai\nBerserker, and Paladin.  If you are one of these classes and you are\noldclass Warrior, you will automatically receive critical strikes.  They\ndo extra damage based on your level.\n\n   If you are not an oldclass warrior but are one of these classes, you\ncan buy the ability to have critical hits by taking the 'enhanced \ncritical' skill.  This will give you critical hitting ability akin to\na warrior's inate ability.  For warriors, this will improve your chance\nof landing a critical hit.  For all characters with 'critical strike'\nthe damage curve is softened slightly.\n\n  Two other specialized crits are available.  'Bludgeoning' works with\nbash weapons, and 'Cleave' works with slashing weapons.  Both give an\nadditional chance to land a critical strike.\n\n  Note that you don't have to take enhanced critical to use cleave or\nbludgeoning.  \n\n Example:\tCleric Paladin\n\tHas no natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit', he\nhas basic crit ability with a soft curve.  If he takes 'cleave', he\nhas better crit chance with slashing weapons, and regular crit chance\nwith all others, and a softer curve.\n\n Example:\tBlademaster\n\tHas natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit' he has\nbetter chance to land a crit plus a softer curve.  If he takes 'cleave',\nhe gets a REALLY good chance to crit with slashers, improved chance to\ncrit with everything else, and soft damage curve.\n~\n\n0 'ENHANCED CRITICAL' 'CLEAVE' 'BLUDGEON'~\nSee 'CRITICAL HIT'.\n~\n\n0 'SUNBURST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sunburst' <target>\n\n    Sunburst is a single-target offensive spell.  It deals LIGHT damage,\nnot fire, and as such it has the potential to blind the victim from the\nintense light.  Sunburst does slightly less damage than the spell 'acid\nblast,' which is part of the basic training of most Boingan mages.\n\n   The origins of the Sunburst spell are unknown.  Researchers have\ndetermined that it is probably usable by Wizards, Mages, and Druids.\n~\n\n0 'SONIC BLAST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sonic blast' <target>\n\n    Sonic Blast emits a wall of mechanic waves that slam into a target in\na concentrated force, snapping bones and causing pain.  Sonic blast does\nslightly less damage than the standard Boingan spell 'acid blast'.   It\nhas the potential to stun the victim for 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of\ncombat.\n\n    Nobody knows where this spell comes from.  A leading researching at\nthe New Thalos academy of magic has suggested that a renegade mage may\nhave escaped into Altirin and developed the spell there.\n~\n\n0 'ADAMANTITE SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'adamantite skin'\n \n    Available to Mages and Wizards only, 'adamantite skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as adamantite.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.  The pages must be researched at the public mage\nlab.  The formula for the adamantite page can be found at the same \nlocation as one of the ingredients.\n~\n\n0 'INCINERATE'~\nSyntax: cast 'incinerate' <victim>\n\n    Incinerate is identicle to the 'acid blast' spell, except it does\nfire-based damage.  Incinerate is available to mages and wizards only.\nIt must be researched at the mage's guild in Midgaard.  The formula\nto create the spell scroll can be found at the magelab.\n~\n\n0 'STEEL SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'steel skin'\n\n\tAvailable to Mages and Wizards only, 'steel skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as steel.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'DIAMOND SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'diamond skin'\n\n\tDiamond skin is available to Mages and Wizards only.  It\ntransforms the flesh of the caster to a diamond-like substance\ncapable of repelling all damage.  Each attack lowers the duration of\nthe affect until eventually it fades completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF FAITH'~\nSyntax: cast 'shield of faith'\n\n   This self-only spell is available to Clerics, Crusaders, Paladins,\nDruids, and Monks.  A shimmering shield of protection is draped over\nthe shoulders of the caster by his/her deity.  The shield will absorb\nthe next several attempts to injure the caster.  The number of attacks\nit absorbs depends on the casting level of the caster.\n\n    This spell belongs to no spell group.  It may only be learned via\nspell pages and the Ritual.\n~\n\n0 RITUAL~\nSyntax: ritual\n \n   The Ritual is a rite by which religious classes learn new spells.\n To perform the ritual, the caster must be holding a spell page that\n has a copy of the spell he wants to learn, and be in an Altar room.\n The better the Altar, the better the chance of the Ritual being \n successful.  Four main factors influence the success of the Ritual.\n A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Level help the caster perform\n the Ritual properly.  But the inherent complexity of the scroll makes\n it more difficult.  \n\n If the Ritual is successful, the caster will receive the spell in his\n 'practice' and 'spells' list, and it functions like a normal spell\n after that.  The scroll is no longer needed, and the caster will never\n lose the spell.  It can be practiced and used like any other spell.\n It does not belong to any spell group.\n\n The caster must meet a level requirement for using the scroll, which\n is generally far lower than the actual level of the spell.  Whether\n or not the Ritual works, the scroll will lose 1 use.  Most scrolls have\n only 1 use, but some lesser scrolls may have more.\n\n The Ritual only works for oldclass clerics.  Oldclass mages will have\n to use study command.\n~\n\n0 STUDY~\nSyntax:  study <scroll name>\n\nThis command only works if your oldclass is mage.  It does one thing:  \ncopy a spellpage.\n\nIf the study attempt  is successful, the caster will receive the spell \nin their 'practice' and 'spells' list.  Once you have enscribed it, the\nthe spellpage is no longer needed.  The learned spell can be practiced\nand used like any other spell.  It does not belong to any spell group.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, 'spell pages'\n\n~\n0 'SPELL PAGES'~\nSpell pages are special scrolls that are found throughout the land of\nBoinga.  They enable an oldclass mage or cleric to learn a new scroll\nwithout having to gain the scroll from a Guildmaster.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, study\n\n~\n0 'REMOVE DISEASE'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove disease' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It \nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Disease is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks disease-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on plague or other non-DOT disease spells.  Remove Disease will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Disease gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 'REMOVE POISON'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove poison' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It\nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Poison is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks poison-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on 'poison' or other non-DOT poison spells.  Remove Poison will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Poison gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 SURNAME~\nSyntax:\tsurname <name>\n\n  Characters who have reached level 35 may select a surname.  This name\n  must conform to the same rules as first names.  You may have the same\n  surname as another character if you wish.  Nobody owns a surname, and\n  nobody has to have your permission to use yours.  Surnames can only be\n  changed by an IMMORTAL once set.  This is not normally done unless your\n  surname is inappropriate, or your character gets married and wishes to\n  take the surname of his or her spouse.  Surnames are only displayed in\n  your score and the who list,  and serve no purpose but for roleplaying \n  and fun.\n\n  You can toggle whether or not you see surnames in the who list by \n  using \"brief surname.\"\n\n~\n\n0 PREFRESH PFRESH~\n\nQ: What exactly is this prefresh I keep hearing about?\n\nA: Over the course of the almost 6 years MHS has been around, characters\n   have levelled under many different systems of gains.  In an effort to\n   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters\n   to \"refresh\" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that\n   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will\n   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years\n   and put everyone on a level playing field.\n\nQ: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?\n\nA: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you \n   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken\n   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all\n   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish\n   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation\n   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you\n   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.\n   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,\n   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.\n   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if\n   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal\n   creation.\n\nQ: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What\n   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after\n   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?\n\nA: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are\n   being discussed include giving out \"xp vouchers\" for the left over xp,\n   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally\n   decided, the answer will be posted here.\n\nQ: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?\n\nA: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through\n   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this\n   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc\n   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using\n   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can\n   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so \n   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.\n\nQ: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,\n   what good are they?\n\nA: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to \n   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you\n   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will\n   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices\n   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.\n\nQ: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.\n\nA: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending\n   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can\n   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills\n   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new\n   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that\n   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be\n   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it\n   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if\n   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.\n\nQ: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?\n\nA: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take\n   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the \n   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.\n\nQ: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my\n   practice sessions that way?\n\nA: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain\n   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up \n   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your\n   practice sessions.\n\nQ: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and\n   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?\n\nA: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your\n   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal\n   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,\n   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find\n   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.\n\nQ: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?\n\nA: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair \n   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all \n   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a \"stock\"\n   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly\n   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special\n   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special\n   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted\n   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of\n   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will\n   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.\n\nQ: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?\n\nA: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing\n   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we\n   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you\n   chose to change races.\n\nQ: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available\n   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?\n\nA: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and\n   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for\n   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes\n   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an \"old class\".\n   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level\n   and a few other things like delays on skills.\n\nQ: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?\n\nA: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the\n   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5\n   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,\n   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're\n   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will\n   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort\n   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.\n   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more\n   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be \n   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.\n\nQ: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want\n   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan\n   system?\n\n   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can \n   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be \n   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used\n   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader\n   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change\n   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,\n   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan\n   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).\n\nQ: What about my Mutant characters?\n\nA: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,\n   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not \n   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain\n   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once\n   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to\n   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you\n   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.\n\nQ: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I\n   think of something not covered in this help file?\n\nA: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had\n   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be \n   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that\n   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially\n   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding\n   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an\n   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either\n   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the \n   Admins.\n\nFINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of \n            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note\n\t    to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.  He'll consider\n\t    adding in your question if it hasn't already been answered.\n\n\n~\n\n0 MYRMIDON~\n\nMyrmidon\nConcept - The ultimate campaigner, the myrmidon is a classic soldier.\nThe military life is law to this kit.  Myrmidons live and die for the\nmartial life.  As a result of their rigid adherence to law and order,\nand the chain of command they tend to be strict and inflexible.\nHowever, the myrmidon is also highly trained in standard combat\nand is a skilled and powerful fighter.\n\nBenefits: \n* Specialization is free.  If the myrmidon has a specialization already\nwhen he picks up the kit, he'll be refunded the trains for it.\n* Because of their extensive training in basic combat prowess,\nmyrmidons, when using their specialized weapon, receive second\nand third attacks more often, anywhere from 125% to 150% depending\non the weapon skill percent and the myrmidon's level.\n* Also because of their extensive training, myrmidons receive a\nfourth attack skill.  With 100% in his/her specialized weapon\nand level 51, the myrmidon receives second attacks 75% of the\ntime, third attacks 50% of the time, and fourth attacks 25% of\nthe time.  These only apply with the specialized weapons.\n\nDrawbacks:\n* Because of their regimented martial life, these soldiers are less\nfamiliar with other fighting styles than their own.  As a result, they\nfight at a slight penalty when going up against creatures of a different\nsize (though not of a difference race if the race is the same size).\nThis penalty decreases as the myrmidon levels.\n\n~\n\n0 SPECIALIZE SPECIALIZATION~\nSyntax: specialize <weapon>\n\tspecialize help (displays this help file and costs)\n\nSpecialization is an option available to warriors and warrior reclasses\nSpecialization offers the warrior a better hitroll, more damage, and a\nremote shot at an extra attack.  Warriors and Blademasters may specialize in\nanything.  The warrior reclasses may specialize as follows:\n \n Samurai: sword, polearm, dagger\n Berzerker: sword, mace, axe\n Paladin: sword, flail, mace\n\nNote: In order to specialize, your oldclass must be warrior. IE a cleric\n      paladin cannot specialize, but a warrior paladin can.\n\n ~\n0 PAB 'PLAYER ADVISORY BOARD'~\nThe player advisory board (PAB) is an outlet for the coders to receive feedback about the major concerns for the game. Issues and suggestions brought forth by the PAB do not have to be implemented at all. Keep that in mind.\n\nEach clan will have 1 member on the board, usually the clan leader, but it can be anyone the clan decides to represent them. Clans can call for a change of representation at any time if the motion is supported by 3 different people, not characters. There will be 3 non-clanner positions on the board. Non-clanners will be appointed to the board by the immortal in charge of the PAB after having applied. These positions will be reviewed and possibly rotated on a monthly basis. Members of the player advisory board will receive an extra (PAB) flag by their name and be able to read notes posted to PAB. This will allow the other players to know who to talk to with their concerns. Being a member of the board is not something to be taken lightly, you will be required to post notes, attend meetings, and talk to the player base quite often.\n\nMeetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis. All other correspondence between the PAB will be through notes to all members, or through tells in order to come up with a working note to post. All members of the player advisory board will have their opinions considered, however the most popular idea will be the one that is sent on to the coders. Any questions about the PAB or its function will be answered by the immortal in charge of it at the time. No one else on the imm team is to be contacted concerning the PAB.\n\nImm currently in charge of the PAB: Hobkin\n\nMortals on the PAB have the PAB flag next to their names.\n\n\n~\n\n0 PYROTECHNICS~\n\nThe pyrotechnics spell group involves the creation of explosive materials.\nIts use is currently limited to samurai, monks and assassins. The spells \nare very powerful.\n\nsmall bomb: a small explosive device explodes on the target\nhigh explosive: blasts opponents with a larger bomb\nsmoke screen: obscures vision and allows an escape from combat\n\n**NOTE: Only Monks,Assassins and Samurai's get Smoke Screen **\n~\n\n0 NETHERMANCER NETHERMANCY FADE~\n\n   The Nethermancer is the most mysterious and unpredictable of spellcasters.\nThrough the art of {Cnethermancer{x, this kit can transfer hp to mana and vice\nversa as needed, at an exchange rate of 2::1.  This conversion is automatic.\nA perfect Nethermancer can only be destroyed when both his hit points and mana\nreach 0.  The Nethermancer also has a unique and uncontrollable ability to \nbecome completely invisible at will.  He cannot control when this happens and\nwhen it ceases, though he can force himself to become visible by engaging in\ncombat.  Nethermancers refer to this skill/annoyance as the {Cfade{x.  Finally,\nthe Nethermancer can bestow upon any weapon a special type of enchantment,\ncalled the nether flag.  What this does, nobody knows, and how the Nethermancer\nmanages to do it, nobody knows that either.  Nethermancers are automatically\noutfitted with a set of special robes.  If they lose their robes, they may use\nthe \"outfit\" command to get another set.  \n\nNethermancers cannot wear armor.\nArmor is defined as any item whose item type is armor.\n~\n\n0 BLADESINGER BLADESONG~\n\nSyntax: Bladesong\n        Bladesong stop\n\n   The Bladesinger is a special type of elf combatant.  Through the use of the\n{Cbladesong{x skill, the elven bladesinger receives a variety of bonuses in\ncombat, as well as up to a 25% chance for an extra attack during each combat\nround.  Bladesong can only be performed with a sword or dagger, and cannot be\nused if the bladesinger is wearing a shield.\n\n   Bladesong stop will end your deadly dance with the blades.\n~\n\n0 BATTLERAGER 'KILLING RAGE'~\n\n  The Battleragers are the elite corps of dwarven warriors.  Ragers are \nunstable at best, flying into insane fits of intense rage.  They can actually\ninflate their own hit points through the use of the {Ckilling rage{x, as well\nas receive a variety of other combat bonuses, including a chance at an extra\nattack during each combat round.  Battleragers can only perform the {Crage{x\nwhen wielding an axe, and cannot see their own hit point count while affected\nby the rage.\n~\n\n0 DAETOK~\n  Syntax: daetok\n\n  Dae'Tok is a Yinnish fighting style that cannot be learned by any other race.\nIt involves a style of trainin that Yinn are taught from childhood, and results\nin spectacular accuracy and maximum potential for damage with any form of \nweapon.  All Yinn become better with this skill as they advance in their\ncareers.  Dae'tok increases both the hitroll and damroll, and increases the\nchances of landing {Csecond{x and {Cthird{x attacks.\n\n~\n\n0 RANGERS~\n\n  The ranger is a master of the wilderness.  As such, (s)he fights most\neffectively in nature - plains, forests, hills and mountains, and is\nuncomfortable and ill-at-ease when indoors or in urban areas.  All rangers\nmay declare a species enemy (see {cSPECIES ENEMY{x), and will receive bonuses\nwhen fighting against any player or creature of that species.  The ranger's\ndislike of his/her species enemy is so strong that those creatures are \npenalized in defensive skills when defending against the ranger.  Rangers may\nmove from any sector to any sector for one movement point, and receive +3 \nmoves when they level.  They also may dual wield with any combination of\nweapon types.\n\nNOTE:  When the material table is complete, Rangers will be forbidden from\nwearing armor made from non-natural materials.  This means they'll be \nrestricted to leathers, cloth, wood, and the like.\n~\n\n0 'SPECIES ENEMY'~\nSyntax: species <race>\n\n   Rangers do not have to declare a species enemy, but the cost of this \nfeature is included with the price of the kits, they pay for it whether they\nuse it or not.  The species enemy must be a PC race.  Once you pick one, you\ncan never -ever- change it.  Select wisely.  Rangers fight remarkably well\nwhen going up against their species enemy, and members of that race don't\ndefend as well against the ranger.  You may not declare your own race as your\nspecies enemy.\n~\n\n0 'TUTINDEX'~\n\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n GETTING STARTED        Introduction to MHS\n TUT2\t\t\tPractices and Trains\n TUT3\t\t\tLevels and Rules Changes\n\n~\n\n0 'GETTING STARTED'~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n   Moosehead SLED is based on ROM2.3, so if you've ever played a ROM MUD,\nmany of these elements will be familiar to you.  If you are new to MHS or\nmudding, this file is designed to help you get started.  One of the first\nthings you will want to do is familiarize yourself with the commands.  The\n\"score\" command contains most of the relevent information about your character.\nThe \"worth\" and \"attrib\" commands show your gold/silver line and attributes\nlines seperately.  The \"who\" command lists all the characters that are logged\nin right now (that you can see).  Type \"equipment\" to see what gear your\ncharacter is currently wearing.  The \"inventory\" command lists the things that\nhave on you but are not currently using.  We recommend that you go through\nthe newbie school (type {crecall{x, {cup{x, {cnorth{x to get there) to get\na good head stat. \n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut2'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT2~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 2 \n\nTRAINS and PRACTICES\n   Your character improves by killing beasties and getting experience.  By\ngaining experience you eventually gain levels, which allow you to learn and\nuse new skills, spells, and abilities.  All new skills that you learn will\nbegin at 1% (except recall and scan, which start at 50%).  Although your skills\nwill naturally improve with use, you have to jump-start them by practicing\nthem.  A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will\neventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which\nthis happens is generally very low at low levels.  To practice a skill, you\nneed to locate a trainer (there is one in the Newbie school, follow the\nsigns to find him).  After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your\nclass to practice skills.  To practice a skill, you need to have at least 1\n{Gpractice{x session available (type {Cpractice{x to see how many you have).\nSimply type: {Cpractice <skill_name>{x, where <skill_name> is the skill\nthat you wish to practice.  Do not use quotes.  The skill you selected will\nincrease by a few percentage points.  The higher your {YINT{x is when you\npractice, the more your skills will increase with each {Gpractice{x session.\nThe highest a skill can go with manually practicing is 75%.  For anything\nbeyond that, you'll just have to use the skill and let it improve naturally.\nYou begin with 5 {Gpractices{x and you receive from 1 to 5 more every time\nyou level.  The higher your {YWIS{x is when you level, the more {Gpractice{x\nsessions you receive.\n\n   Your character also has 5 primary {Yattributes{x that summarize his or her\nabilities.  They are: {Ystrength{x, {Ydexterity{x, {Yintelligence{x, \n{Ywisdom{x, {and {Yconstitution{x.  See the individual help files for each \nfor detailed information on how they affect your character.  {YAttributes{x\nstart at a specific value depending on what race and class you selected. To\nimprove your attributes, you use a {Gtraining{x session.  You begin with 3\n{Gtrains{x and after that, you receive 1 more every time you level.  Your\n{Yattributes{x range from 3 to 25, and usually start out between 10 and 15.\nYou will want to train your {YCON{x and {YWIS{x first.  This action also\nrequires a trainer.  There is one in the newbie school.  These trainers are\nnot always the same as the {Gpractice{x trainers.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut3'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT3~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 3\n\nLEVELS and RULES CHANGES\n \n   As your character levels up, some of the game rules will change.  Also,\nyou'll be gradually forced to explore more the game world.  At level 6, you\nwill nol onger be able to enter newbie school, and must locate trainers in \nthe world somewhere.  Your character does not have to worry about the size of\nhis/her armor until level 11, and is able to use the {Crecall{x skill at will\nuntil level 11 as well.  After that, recalling requires the use of deity gifts\n(see {chelp deity{x), spells, or magic items.  The game will warn you about \nthese changes as you approach level 11.\n\n   When you level, it is in your best interests to wear what is called\n\"levelling gear.\"  Anything can technically be \"levelling gear\", but this\nterm generally refers to equipment that people only wear when they are about\nto level.  Usually this equipment gives you bonuses to your {YCON{x, {YWIS{x,\nand {YINT{x (see the helpfiles for each attribute for more information).\nWhere do you find levelling gear?  Ask around and explore, that is your best\nbet.  Note that when you level, the amount of experience that you need to \nreach the next level doesn't change.  Rather, you begin to gradually get less\nexperience for the same monsters.  You'll need to explore and find new monsters\nto slaughter that are more of a challenge.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut4'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 SPELLCRAFT~\n\n   Spellcraft is a special skill in which the spellcaster has studied\nthe metaphysics of spellcasting.  Those skilled with spellcraft are able\nto identify which spells other are casting, whether they are of the same class\nor not.  They also suffer a smaller mana drain when they loose concentration,\ncan sometimes cast a +1 over their normal casting level.  Spellcraft has a\nvariety of other, more subtle effects that make for a more solid \nspellcasting character.  This skill is incredibly difficult to increase.\n~\n\n0 BANKS BANKING DEPOSIT WITHDRAW~\nSyntax: deposit <#>\n        withdraw <#>\n\n   There is one banker in Midgaard, his name is Otho, he can be\nfound on clan road.  You may only deposit eggs into the bank, and they\nmust be in your inventory for you to do it.  Your total number of eggs\nin the bank is listed in your score.  You do not collect interest and \nthere is no minimum balance.  Your eggs are completely safe in the bank.\nNotice that unsavory individuals may hang around and attempt to steal your\neggs when you go to deposit/withdraw them.  The bank is not responsible \nfor stolen eggs.  \n\n~\n\n0 COLOR COLOUR~\n\n   Syntax based on Lope's standard colour code.\n\n   To enable color, type \"color on\".  To disable, type \"color off\".\n\n   This SLED automatically colorizes some elements of the game.  If you do\nnot like our colors, do not turn color on.  If you want to use only a few\nparts of color, get a client and utilize its color features.\n\n   You may use the following in any place to create color; notes, titles,\ntells, channel use, any where.  Please note that if you do not reset the\ncolor to 'normal', your color will bleed.  If you do this, you will be \nfrozen, so be very careful.\n\n    Red:    {{r for {rnormal{x, {{R for {Rbright{x\n    Blue:   {{b for {bnormal{x, {{B for {Bbright{x\n    Green:  {{g for {gnormal{x, {{G for {Gbright{x\n    Yellow: {{y for {ynormal{x, {{Y for {Ybright{x\n    Black:  {{D for {Dblack{x,  {{W for {Wwhite{x\n    Cyan:   {{c for {cnormal{x, {{C for {Cbright{x\n    Magenta:{{m for {mnormal{x, {{M for {Mbright{x\n    NORMAL: {{x resets colors to normal.\n     \n    Proper use of color:\n\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS{{x!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS{x!\n\n    Improper use:\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp>\n    {x\n\n    Get it?  If not, don't use it, please.  We don't issue warnings for\n    stupidity.\n~\n\n\n0 TRADE TRADING MUDTRADER~\nMudTrader 1.1\n\nSyntax: trade <cmd> <arg1> |amount|\n\nCommand Summary\n> trade request <character>\t \t- Start a trade \n> trade accept <character>\t\t- Accept a request to trade\n> trade decline <character>\t\t- Decline a request to trade\n> trade clear\t\t\t\t- Clear the current trade\n> trade cancel\t\t\t\t- Abort current trade\n> trade add <item in inventory>\t\t- Add something to the trade\n> trade add <gold|silver> <amount>\t- Add money to the trade\n> trade remove <item in trade>\t\t- Remove an item from the trade\n> trade remove <gold|silver> <amount>   - Remove money from the trade\n> trade show\t\t\t\t- Display current trade\n> trade approve\t\t\t\t- Finalize trade\n\nMudTrader is a special program that lets the MUD software act as a\nthird-party agent between two players who want to trade something,\nor purchase something from each other.  When you are trading, the money\nand items are removed from your inventory and held in memory.  If you remove\nthe items/money from the trade, leave the room, or cancel/clear the trade,\nyou get them back.  If you approve the trade, they go over to the other\nperson and are no longer yours.  When you are happy with the trade, type\n\"trade approve\" to finalize it.  BOTH traders must type \"trade approve\"\nfor it to work.  If anybody changes the trade, by either adding to it or\nremoving stuff from it, both people must type \"trade approve\" again.\n~\n\n-1 WIZLIST~\n\n        ________      ===============================      ________\n      /+_+_+_+_+_\\    |    The Gods of Moosehead    |    /+_+_+_+_+_\\\n      \\__________/    ===============================    \\__________/\n        |::XXXX|                                           |XXXX::|\n        |X::XXX|              Creator / IMP                |:XXXX:|\n        |XX::XX|               -----------                 |::XXXX|\n\t|XXX::X|        Rusty, The Oxidizing Dragon        |X::XXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|            Benefactor / Coder             |:XXXX:|\n        |XXXX::|               -----------                 |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|       Boogums \"BooglyDude\" McDugal        |::XXXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |:XXXX:|                                           |XXXX::|\n/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\                           /<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\\n\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/       Immortals           \\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\n       |.  /\\ . |            ---------------              |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Alagaster                 | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |               BriarRose  - ADMIN        |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |               KallaLilly                |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Karag                     | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|               Kuno - ADMIN              | . /\\  .|\n       | .//\\.  |               Slodhian - ADMIN          | .//\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       |.  /\\  .|                                         |.  /\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | .//\\  .|     Long live the memory of Mandrake    | .//\\  .|\n        \\. /\\  /         who left before his time.         \\. /\\  /\n         \\ /\\ /    [ IMMORTAL ] Grey Kellam : Mandrake      \\ /\\ /\n          \\/\\/                                               \\/\\/\n           \\/                                                 \\/\nArt by Blackstaff and Sara\n\nLast Updated By Boogums - 30NOV03\n~\n-1 HERO HEROES~\nThe list that follows is that of those who have attained the\nlevel of 52.

Here, anyone of level 52\nor higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the\nusual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;\nexamples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to\ncreation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,\nability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote\nplayers to immortality.\n\nSince immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)\na carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal\nbehavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without\nexplicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please\ndon't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or\nyou'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to\nthis file.\n\nThe duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,\nare topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are\nfraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)\n~\n\n-1 SOCIALS~\n \nThis is a complete list of socials for Moosehead SLED:\nCompiled originally by: Sara\naccuse       adjust      air          apologize     applaud     babble\nbark         bcatch      beckon       beer          bearhug     beg\nbird         bkiss       bleed        blink         blush       boast\nboggle       bonk        bounce       bow           brb         burp\ncackle       caress      charge       cheer         chuckle     clap\nclaw         collapse    comfort      comb          cough       cover\ncower        cringe      criticize    cry           cuddle      curse\ncurtsey      dance       daydream     drool         duck        embrace\nexplode      eyebrow     faint        fart          flare       flash\nflex         flinch      flip         flirt         flutter     fondle\nfrench       frown       fume         gasp          giggle      glare\ngoose        grimace     grin         groan         grope       grovel\ngrowl        grumble     hand         head          hiccup      highfive\nhop          howl        hug          hush          ignore      innocent\ninsane       judge       kiss         knee          laugh       lick\nlove         lust        massage      meditate      moan        moon\nmosh         mutter      nibble       nod           nudge       nuzzle\npant         passout     pat          peck          pie         pinch\npissed       plead       point        poke          ponder      pout\npray         propose     puke         punch         purr        ramble\nraspberry    rofl        roll         rub           ruffle      run\nscratch      scream      serenade     shake         shiver      shrug\nsigh         sing        slap         slobber       smile       smirk\nsnap         snarl       sneeze       snicker       sniff       snore\nsnort        snowball    snuggle      sob           spam        spank\nspit         squeal      squeeze      squirm        stare       stretch\nstrip        stroke      strut        sulk          swoon       tackle\ntease        thank       threaten     tickle        tip         tongue\ntwiddle      type        undress      view          wave        whine\nwhistle      wiggle      wince        wink          wonder      worry\nworship      yawn        yeehaw       yodel         rose\tlaces\ntank\t     starve\t aargh\t      homework\t    puff\tdiffer\nyae\t     lightbulb   voodoo       ogg\t    confused\tbeam\nbite\t     discodance  scuff        whap\t    lag\t\tchortle\nzerbert      twitch      roxbury\n \n~\n\n-1 MERC~\nThis sled is based on Merc 2.1, created by Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn.  \nMerc 2.1 is available as Merc_21.tar.gz from ftp.tcp.com and \nftp.math.okstate.edu.\nE-mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com' to join the merc mailing list.\n\nThanks to ...\n  ...

Their universal greed is the strongest bond between\nany of the existing clanners.\n  \nAvarice is a highly selective clan, who tends to keep its numbers\nlow.  The exclusivity is derived from the clan's lack of trust in\noutsiders, and a desire to have a large market that can be used\nin amassing great wealth in the name of the Avarice clan.\n   \nEntrance Requirements:\n -Must be level 20+\n -Must have the steal skill (above 75%)\n    \nAvarice's great power and wealth must be protected at all costs.  In order\nto ensure that only loyal members to the cause of Avarice are gulded, expect\ntests of your abilities and quests to prove your faithfulness if you\nchoose to join the ranks of Avarice.\n\nAvarice Charter (rules)\n    \n -You MAY attack anyone of a thief-based reclass (thief, rogue, assassin,\n  berzerker, monk)\n -You may NOT attack anyone who is not a thief-based reclass.\n  EXCEPTION:  You are allowed to attack to aid a clanmate who has\n    been attacked.  Note that this doesn't mean you can attack your\n    clanmate, but you may attack anyone who is attacking them.\n -You do NOT group with those outside of your clan EVER. \n -You do NOT help those outside of your clan for free.\n -Read those again.  Avarice does not trust outsiders be they clanners\n  or non-clanners.  You may sell items and services, as this is part \n  of your clan ideals.  But you are not Matookers or Honor.\n -There will be no alliances with any clans.\n\nSee 'help avarice sanction' for sanctioning information.\n\nAvarice is not a sin, it's a way of life...\n~\n\n-1 HONOR~\nIt is a time of ideals,\nof leaders, of followers,\nof love, of friendship,\nof life, of death, of truth...\nof HONOR!!\n\nWe are truly now the new generation of HONOR clansmen and women.\nOur forefathers began the quest for justice and truth a millennia ago, \non the plains of Northern Midgaard.

He was travelling the land and noticed that\nthere was power in the magical arts that was far beyond his or any others'\ncomprehension. He decided from that day forth to unite all pure spellcasters\nso as to fully understand and improve upon the arts of magic. He and his\nfaithful followers travelled the lands of Boinga to search out all those that\nhad the pure blood of magic in their veins. Those who would not join him and\nhis brethren were made to pay with their lives.\n\nHere we are left but a few proud spellcasters who have survived the trials\nof time. Now we shall rise again amongst the ashes of our ancestors. In our\nplight to truly unite the purity of magic, we have been forced to divide\ninto three sects.\n\nThose who adorn the White Robes of Warlock show the purity of magic through\nkindness. Their role in our clan is to guide all young spellcasters to gain\nknowledge of the magical arts.\n\nThose who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.\n\nThose who adorn the Black Robes of Warlock use the darker side of magic to\npunish the renegades who chose not to follow the true path, and defend our\nclan against those who would wage war. \n\nOur goals of the unity of pure magic has made us a very diverse clan, and for\nall those interested you may speak with any member of our clan and they will\nput you in touch with our recruitment officers.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements:\n  \n* You must be a pure spellcaster\n  (mage, cleric, elementalist, druid, wizard, crusader)\n   \nWarlock Charter (rules)\n*  You may not group with any clanner who is a:\n   Mage, Cleric, Elementalist, Druid, Wizard, or Crusader\n   They abuse the art and are to be killed on site.\n\n*  You may group with / help any nonclanner.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 RONOH~\n.\"It is a time of ideals,\n of leaders, of followers,\n of love, of friendship,\n of life, of death...\n of Honor.\"\n\nWE are the new generation of Honor clansmen and women.  Our forefathers\nbegan the quest for justice a millennia ago, on the plains of Northern\nMidgaard.  Blood and tears were shed to regain honor once lost.  In the end,\nClan Honor's strength in numbers allowed for victory, but at a great cost\nin lives.  The evil were caught, drawn, quartered, and hung.  They remain\nthere even today, as a reminder of the folly in betrayal, and the swift hand\nof vengeance.\n \nCLAN Honor's ideals come from the very heart of it's members.  We exist to\npurge this realm of the evil that exists in the minds and souls of many. We\nstrive to assist our own, especially in accomplishing the first goal.\nOur actions may not always be presented in the light of Good; although most\nwill agree it is sometimes necessary to combat evil with it's own devices.\n\nTO be allowed to join Honor, you must first send a note to 'Honor' stating\nyour intentions.  You will also be responsible for petitioning a Knight, \nEarl, or Lord to give you a quest.  Expect a rigorous interview, for the \npaths of false Honor may lead to your own death.\n\n\"May the light of Honor show you the true paths to glory...\"\n                                  --- Thunder\n                                      Clan Father\n                                      \n~\n-1 NOIGEL~\nThe Legion of the Goblin Hoard.\nLong ago a new race was formed, offshoots from the human race, the Goblin\ncame into being. They were a peacefull kind, only wishing to keep their \nrace going, raising cattle, and growing crops.  But as outsiders came to \nthe lands of the Goblins and tried to take over their farmland, it became \nobvious they would need some kind of defense, an army of some sort to fend \noff the newcommers.  And so was formed the Legion.\n\nThe Legion has one reason for being, and that is to keep the Goblins alive.\nIf you are a Goblin, and want to stand up for yourself in this world of\nraces far bigger then the Goblins, then the Legion is the place for you.\nThe Legion does not wish to seek out battle, we just wish to defend ourselves.\nAny race can join the Legion, but only a Goblin can ever hope to become\nanything more then just a guardsman.\n\nIf you wish to join the Legion, to help the Goblin race survive, you must\ncontact one of the leaders, or a recruiter, in a note or when you meet one\non-line. You must be able to roleplay, because the Legion is a clan formed \naround roleplaying and it is imperitive that you can do so to join this clan. \nIf you are a non-goblin then you may have to prove yourself worthy of \nprotecting the Goblins, because it would be a horrible thing if we recruited \nthe weak for this task.\n\nLONG LIVE THE LEGION!\n~\n\n-1 ELCRIC~\nThe Clan Circle\n\n    \"As one I am weak, but as many we are strong.  We are the Keepers of\nMagic.  We are the Magi of Clan Circle, Never Ending and Ever Lasting.\"\n\n    Magic.  It is the lifeblood of the universe.  It is magic that drives\nus, and it is in magic that we find true power.  This is the founding belief\nof clan Circle.  Through magic, any problem can be solved, any obstacle over-\ncome.  The main goal of Circle is to encourage and foster the development\nand increased use of magic, through the use of our own magic, power, and\nstrength.\n\n    The members of Clan Circle reside in the Tower, a massive building in \nwhich we work our spells.  Members of Circle receive free spell-ups, enchants,\ncorpse retrievals, and all of the other benefits that one would expect from a\nclan.  Although all clan members are expected to be willing to help others,\nthe Mentors of Circle are dedicated to this task.  The Guardians of Circle \nare the clan's military force, ready to fight at a moment's notice, and\nwilling to sacrafice their lives in defense of our ideals, members, and magic.\n\n    Roleplaying is *not* required to join Circle.  The only roleplaying\nthat is asked of all members is that you keep your characters seperate, as per\nthe basic \"no multiplaying\" rule of MHS.  We do encourage members to roleplay\nand develop their characters, but we do not require it.  Tithing of income\nis also encouraged but not required.\n\nCircle Leadership and Law\n\n    Circle is overseen by the Conclave, a council of 7 leaders who are\nelected or appointed from the clan.  There are very few defined rules in \nCircle.  We are a clan, we are Magi, we are family.  All members of Circle\nare given as much personal freedom as possible, and in return, we expect \nthat all members take responsibility for their actions, words, and beliefs.\n\nJoining Circle\n\n    Any race or class can join Circle.  Although our specialty is magic,\nand we generally only actively recruit mages and clerics, warriors and thieves\nare welcome to apply for admission.\n\n    The is only one requirement to join Circle.  Mages and Clerics must\nhave at least 8 spell groups, and Warriors and Thieves must have at least 3.\nBecause dragons are very difficult and timely to advance, the draconian spells\nare considered a spell group for the purpose of meeting this requirement.\n\n    If you wish to join Circle, talk to a Recruiter.  Any Inner Circle\nor Outer Circle is also a Recruiter.  If no recruiter is available, then post\na note to Circle, informing us of your race, class, and current level.  All\napplicants will be given a thorough interview, and some will be asked to \ncomplete a quest.\n\n                                  - Clan Circle, Never Ending, Ever Lasting\n~\n\n-1 LONER~\nLoners are individualists, standing alone from any Clan, but subject\nto the same rules as clanners with respect to pkilling, pstealing,\nand transportation spells.  By definition, Loners have no common\nhall, no leaders, and no affiliation among each other, save what they\nagree upon for themselves.\n\nTo become a Loner simply issue the 'loner' command between levels 5\nand 20.  This command -cannot- be reversed under any circumstance.\nDo it carefully.\n~\n\n-1 ECNALAB~\nIn life there are those who take, those who give, those who lead and\nthose who follow.  Seldom are they one and the same, but this is the\nland of Boinga, the land where the beautiful princess Alia once\nstepped. She had a vision, a vision of a family where to lead and to\nfollow to give and to take were equally respected by all who were\npart of the family of BALANCE.\n\nIn the days when Alia walked among us we were happy, at peace and\nable to console ourselves that we were no-one's master and no-one's\nslave. But Alia left this realm and chaos ensued. We strived to\nbecome what she had taught us and when we achieved it she did walk\namong us again.  Dissention was rife and soon after her visitation\nBalance fell under internal turmoil and deceit; the few feeling\nthat they took precedence over the many...\n\nAnd so this continued until one day few were left. They decided\nto make their own way and live the teachings of Alia rather than\nfollow them, throwing scorn on the likes of Riders those who would\nhave sheep rather than friends.\n\nWith that Balance was reborn!\n\nBalance is a family of members, none being any more important than\nany other. We strive for total equality and are in a constant\nstate of war with Riders, who see some fit to be ranked far above\nothers.  To join Balance just speak to any full member and they\nwill give you an interview (or arrange one for later). A full member\nis one who has been in the clan for 6 levels (or 20 days at 51). This\nis so new members have time to learn the ways of Balance before \ncompleting entrance into our clan.\n\nThe Current Speaker of Balance is Rigger.\nThe speaker of Balance is the person who is elected to be the\nspokesperson to the outside world.\n~\n\n-1 ESIMED~\nChildren of Demise\n\n        Darkness swallows light, death extinguishes life, and hope is but a \nfoolish dream. All things must come to an end, and the Children of Demise\nfaithfully help the end come quicker. We willingly bear the burden of life,\nso we can help the unbelievers on into the everlasting darkness. To enter\nthe darkness serving the faith is the greatest priviledge. To crush all\nhope and happiness is one the many steps to our eventual success.\nI, Eiji, am the father of Demise. I have come forth from the shadows to bring\nthe words and wisdom of Demise. There is no stopping our tide. We shall \nprevail.\n\nClan Demise\n\n        Clan Demise consists of a cult with a inner hierarchy. You rank\nis based on your level, your acts in the name of Demise, and your Role-\nplaying. Clan Demise allows pking, pstealing, and other cruel activities.\nWe work together as a tight unit, planning carefully all ventures.\nIf thou wishest to join Demise, expect a serious questioning from members.\nThey tolerate no stupidity, foolhardiness, or insolence.\nROLE-PLAYING is a MUST.\n~\n\n-1 DEMISE~\nAbove, in the planes of the Deities lies one of true evil.  His power is fueled\nby destruction and vengeance that are channeled through the wrath of his \nglorious children!  We are the Children of Cthon!  Spawns of Hell, Delivers \nof Death, Vengeance and Chaos.  We are the elite army of the greatest \npower.  We bare the burden of life to crush all hope and extinguish all life, \nmaking Cthon ever so much stronger! \n\nThose within our ranks have the privilege of serving the greatest evil.  As such\nCthon himself grants the elite army with speed and aura of fear that makes \nour enemies cower in fear with our power!  Possessing so much power we \nharness it and war with every existing clan, loner and outcast.  No treaty or \nbond between clans is powerful enough to stop our storm,  for we come for \nyou?always. In the words of wisdom of Eiji, the father of Demise, \"There is no\nstopping our tide! We shall prevail!\"\n\nClan Demise\n\nTo enter Clan Demise is a feat in itself.  Do not come looking for us.  We \nwill come to you.  Show us your power by killing and looting.  Any attack \non you consider it a test.  You must also be a minimum of level 15, and  \neven then, when we feel you are ready you fill be asked to join and no \nsooner.\n\nClan Demise is a cult of inner hierarchy, in which your rank is on the basis\nof your level,  your acts in demise, and other cruel activities.  If you do not\nmaintain your power and skills you will be outcasted and hunted by your \nformer clan.  No stupidity, foolishness or insolence is allowed, and  \nrole-playing is a must.  \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You must have a Thug or Killer flag\n\nDemise Charter (rules)\n{YGROUPING{x or {YWORKING{x with anyone outside the clan is *expressly* \nforbidden! If they are in your range, kill them!!!\nYou may assist nonclanners as you see fit.\n\n~\n\n-1 ZEALOT~\nZealot....\n\n\"Blessed are we, the Children of the Almighty, for we will live to see His\neternal paradise brought upon Boinga.  Let us pray...\"\n\nThe words of the Almighty are spoken, and his children wake, and listen.\nThese children are known for their devotion to the Almighty, the one\ntrue God of Boinga. Teachers, Warriors, Healers, Sages, Young and old\nalike, they bind together under one holy creed. Seeking out the false\nfaiths and their unholy prophets, they continue steadfastly to cleanse\nthe lands of the evil that has spawned within the hearts of pagan\nmen.\n\nThese children of the Almighty, from all walks of life, are bound\nheart, mind, and soul to a common purpose, and a common name:\n\nZealot.\n\nThe faithful of the Almighty have but one purpose:  to annihilate the\nfalse faiths of the lands through any means necessary.\n\nNoone shall be considered neutral.  All will fall before the might of\nthe Almighty!\n\nEntrance Requirements:\nNone\n\nZealot Charter (rules)\nYou may not group with or work with any other clanners.  They all\nserve false gods.  You may work or group with nonclanners as \ntheir gods have already been conqured by the Almighty and they are\nonly humoring themselves.\n\n~\n-1 'ZEALOT RANKS'~\n----------------------------Ranking----------------------------\n\n/1 The Light of the Almighty. [*]\nThe members of the light are entrusted with the task of spreading\nthe teachings of the Almighty. They proclaim his holy glories to\nthe heathen nations, distribute holy scripture, heal and aid fellow\nbrethren in the congregation. They aid in the equipping and teaching\nof new recruits of the Almighty's Church. They may also aid in the\ncleansing of heathens or errant pledges, but this is not required.\nThey also aid the recruiters in bringing new recruits into the clan.\n\n/2 The Hand of the Almighty. [!]\nThe members of the hand concentrate their skills to the task of\neliminating false prophets and heathens. They seek out the heathen\nfilth and send their souls to the light via a bloodshed cleansing.\nThe creed: \"There is no forgiveness of sin without the shedding of\nblood.\" is very dear to them, and each has taken this crusade to\nheart. They also may aid in the gathering of new recruits, but this\nis not their main task.\n\n/3 The Crown of the Almighty. [^]\nThese members seek to enforce clan policy through intervention\nwhen the recruiters or the Anointed are unavailable. They report\ndirectly to the Anointed any violation that they witness within the\ncongregation, and are appointed only by the Anointed. Their prime\ntasks are the purging of false pledges, and to aid in collection of\nfunds of the clan.\n\nAll Ranks: Inquisitors.\nDue to vile forces of greed and lust, power struggles within the\nclan are all too frequent. The Inquisitors seek out those within\nthe clan whose faith in the Almighty and whose loyalty to the Anointed\nare weak or insubordinate. They report to the Grand Inquisitor or\ndirectly to the Anointed, who then deliberate on any action which\nmight be necessary to quell the disturbance. Who is an inquisitor?\nThat knowledge is only kept by the Grand Inquisitor and by the Anointed.\nAll inquisitors are chosen by the Grand Inquisitor or the Anointed. Any\ninquisitor who exposes his status can expect to have it revoked at best,\nor become an outcast at worst.\n\nRanks 1-3 are considered equal in all aspects, and shall be treated\nas such. No one rank is superior to the other, and should not become\nboastful over his brothers. Such boasting breeds intolerance and resentment,\nand is highly frowned upon.\n\n/4 The Preacher of Light, The Hand of Destruction, The Crowning Glory\nThe Holy Scribe, The Grand Inquisitor, Protectors of the Faith.\nThese select positions are hand picked by the Anointed, and given\nresponsibility of recruiting, as well as tending to their own\nbranch affairs. None possesses any rank above the other, and all report\ndirectly to the Anointed. These members also collect funds from the\nclan.\n\n/5 The Anointed of the Almighty.\nThese chosen children of the Almighty oversee all that happens within\nthe church of the Almighty. These people are said to be the direct\nvoice of the Almighty, and obediance of their decrees is required.\nThese people have complete control of the congregation, but may seek\nadvice on internal matters as they so choose.\n~\n\n\n\n-1 POSSE~\nA band of evil beings roamed the lands, spreading fear and chaos,\nkilling, looting, and bringing havoc to the world.  Within this band\nwere a few consumed with guilt, which could no longer bear the screams\nand death cries of the fallen.  Straying from their evil ways, they\nformed a Posse.\n\nThe Posse would no longer stand by and let criminals walk freely about\nthe world.  Thus, Posse attacks all KILLERS, THIEVES, THUGS, and\nRUFFIANS.  In doing so, Posse has made a few enemies along the way.\n\nPosse does not wage war upon any clan.  We strive to kill all KILLERS,\nTHIEVES, THUGS, and RUFFIANS, dealing swift justice where possible.\nTaking this into account, no member of Posse is to carry any of the \nabove flags, with the exception of the Ruffian flag.  We are of the\nunderstanding that sometimes excessive force is necessary, and also\nthat accidents _do_ happen.  Should other flags occur, each such incident\nwill be judged on its merits.  As a general rule, Thug flags are usually\nunacceptable at best and Killer and Thief flags are almost always an\noutcastable offense.  Exceptions can be made for bugs and extenuating\ncircumstances, again as the situation dictates.\n\nWe are not a group of individuals, we are a Clan family of sorts, in that\nwe help each other out whether it be pkilling, eq, grouping, spell-ups, \nor even just to sit and talk.  We do not group with those that carry\nflags, but will deal with them for goods if it is for the good of our\ngreater cause and they are deemed trustworthy enough to do so.\n\nPosse consists of those who are Good, Neutral, and Evil.  All races\nand classes are considered in joining, but we do not accept just anyone.\nPlayers are urged to talk to a recruiter at an early age/level as to\nnot invest too much time into a character who will be turned down.\nTeamwork is a _must_, as is clan/pkill experience.  Roleplaying is not\nrequired.\n\nSanctions will be handed out to those members of posse who have trouble\nfollowing the posse charter. These can be given by both /4s and /5s and\nwill generally last for the duration of your flag. However, if the /4 or /5\nyou ask to remove you sanction feels that you have not yet served your time\nthey will post a note to the clan stating why they feel that way and how\nlong they feel you should keep the sanctions. It will then be upto a /5 to\nremove the flag. Sanctions will be handed out as follows:\n\nRuffian - Skill, Store, Portal Room, Regen, Healer\nThug - Healer, Regen, Skill, Store, Portal Room, Hall for 1 week.\nKiller and Thief - Immediate outcast, no questions asked. \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You may not have a flag (see definition below).\n\nPosse Charter (rules)\n\n- any member of any clan that carries a flag (Killer, Thief, Thug or Ruffian),\n  is to be killed.\n- No member of Posse may carry any flag. Carrying a flag is grounds for \n  sanctions. The worse the flag the worse the sanctions.\n- Grouping with or helping any member of any clan with any flag is forbidden.\n~\n-1 SREDIR REDIR~\nAnd when He opened the seal there went out a horse that was red, and power was\ngiven unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that its\ninhabitants should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great\nsword...\n\nAnd behold there came forth an ashen horse, and he that sat upon him had a pair\nof balances in his hand; with a measure of wheat on one side and a mound of\ndust on the other.  And the power was given unto him to steal that which\nnourishes the body--and the spirit...\n\nAnd lo a black horse then appeared, and he that sat upon him bore a bow whose\narrows flew across the sky as an infectious cloud; and unto him the power to\ndisfigure and drain away the life of Man was given...\n\nAnd behold a pale horse arose; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell\nfollowed with him...\n\nAnd power was given unto them over the four parts of the Earth; to kill with\nthe Sword, and with Hunger, with Disease, and with Death...And lo there was a\ngreat earthquake; and the Sun became as black as sackcloth, and the Moon became\nas blood, and the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth...\n\nFor when the great day of His wrath has come...who shall be able to stand?\n\nMAKE WAY FOR THE APOCALYPSE...\n\n[Premise]\nWe are a lawful organization constrained by the inevitability of the End; we\nare but harbingers of the coming Apocalypse.  We do not seek out conflict or\ndestruction, nor do we believe in pkilling and pstealing with impunity.  Our\npurpose is not to bring about the End but rather to facilitate what inevitably\nmust, and will be.\n\nThose who wish to become minions of the Apocalypse must request an audience\nwith the proper Incarnation.\n\nWarriors should direct their requests for membership to WAR.\nThieves should direct their requests for membership to FAMINE.\nClerics should direct their requests for membership to PESTILENCE.\nMages should direct their requests for membership to DEATH.\n~\n\n-1 OUTCAST OUTCASTS~\nOutcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They\nare, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in\ntheir lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are\na few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:\n\n-- Attacking a fellow clan member\n-- Stealing from a fellow clan member\n-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan\n-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership\n-- Receiving a DWEEB flag\n-- Spying for another Clan\n-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention\n\nOnce someone has been Outcast, they may not rejoin another clan unless\na voucher is purchased, these cost 50eggs. \n\n~\n\n-1 DWEEB~\nDweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the\ngods themselves.  A Dweeb is given no safe haven, as they are allowed to be\nattacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can\nbestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for\na Dweeb flag:\n\n-- Continually spamming the public channels.\n-- Continually harrassing particular players.\n-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.\n-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.\n-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.\n-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.\n-- Using CB lingo on public channels\n-- Using l33t speak on public channels\n   (You don't look cool, you look like an idiot.  Real hackers don't use\n    it.  Quit watching TechTV.)\n\nNote that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings\nbefore you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to\nhave done something truly horrendous.\n\nAlso, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the\nperiod of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you\nmust live with it.\n~\n\n-1 MATOOK~\nHelp 'Matook'\nMatook is an organized group of characters that have shown interest\nin dedicating their time to helping out other individuals as they\ncan.  This can involve spell ups, retrieving equipment, corpse\nretrievals, enchantments, and other miscellaneous  tasks that the\nindividual is willing to do.\n\nThe helpers of Matook gathered together and created a Grand Church\nin the North-Western Corner of Midgaard. Here in the Church many\nhelpful souls can be found, as well they have provided fast healing\nand mana recouperation rooms for the needy.\n\nIf you believe in yourself to follow the ways of Matook and wish to\njoin their order be prepared to give an example of your skill and\nknowledge of Boinga.  You will be directed to speak with a member of\nthe Council who will bestow a quest upon you. Any Matooker will be\nwilling to answer any further questions about the the Church in\ngeneral and please don't be shy to ask for some assistance in any\narea. Of course, since Matookers are non-clanners, clan interference\nis always forbidden.\n\n\"One cannot love with anger and hate for fear will always ruin one's\nfate...To live a life full of peace one must love or see it decrease.\"\n\n-May Matook Protect You.\n\n~\n\n-1 DONATION DONATIONS~\n\nThe DIKU liscence states that I can not take any money from anyone \nplaying MHS.

This character has\nnot yet been refreshed. If you 'continue' you will go through parts of the\ncreation process allowing you to change parts of your character to better\nbalance you within the game. If you 'quit' this character remains unrefreshed\nand you can do it at another time.\n\nYou can test pfreshing a character by logging into the OLC Port instead of\nhere with this character. Login to sled.moosehead.com port 8080. Once you\npfresh a character on port 4000 you can not undo or retry it.\n\nIf you have any questions as to what this process involves we recommend\n'quit' and create a new character and read 'help pfresh' once you are in\nthe game and ask questions of the other players and Immortals.\n~\n\n52 JOBS~\nAs an Immortal on MHS, there are certain things expected of you, and\nespecially as a newer immortal, you should be mindful of exactly what\nit is you're supposed to be doing.  Below is a short summary of what's\nexpected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.\n\nNote:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.\n\nAll levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is\ncheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of\na higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings\nwith mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as\nyou would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of\nan Immortal.\n\n52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive\nor have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,\nsave to follow the same rules as everyone else.\n\n53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an\nImmortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how\nyou act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if\nyou are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be\nplaced at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the\nrules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the\nland, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of\nbeing an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob\nstrength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking\nquestions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.\n\n55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available\nto you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'\nstage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level\nwhere you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be\ngiven a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations\nat this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn\nOLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.\nYou have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any\nmajor decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced\nImmortal.\n\n57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to\nImmortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used\nto penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you\nshould have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,\nand a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at\nthis level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,\nbuild on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.\nYour conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but\nyou're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'\nonce you've reached this point.\n\n58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp\nof the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any\nsituation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to\nSenior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some\nof the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all\nImmortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected\nfor their dedication to MHS.\n\n59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still \nkeeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have\ntheir hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available\non MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,\nyou have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,\nor you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure\nabout, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS\ninside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins\nare also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new\ncode for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.\n\n60 - Implementor.  If you need to be told what your job as an Implementor\nis, you should probably put down the crack pipe now...\n\n~\n\n-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~\nYou may kill other players once you join a Clan or Loner.  If they are \nmore than 8* levels below you, you can't do it.  If your intended victim\nis not in a Clan, again you can't touch them (unless they have a THIEF \nor DWEEB flag). You may steal from other players if they are not more \nthan 7* levels below your level, and in a Clan. For either of the above \nactions you will recieve a flag and may have trouble with guards in town.  \nAlso other players may get to attack you.\n\nThere are specific ways to get certain flags:\n(Tf) A thief flag is gotten for failing an attempt at stealing from a \n     player.  You may be attacked by anyone up to 12 levels above you\n     when you have this flag.  It can only be lost by dying to another\n     player while you have no other flags.\n(R)  A ruffian flag is gotten from initiating combat on an unflagged \n     player. This flag has no consequence except saving someone who \n     attacks you from receiving a flag.  This flag is lost by dying to \n     another player.\n(Th) A thug flag is received if you actually kill a player. This \n     enables people up to 10 levels above you to attack you .  This \n     flag is lost by dying to a player either 1 or 2 times depending \n     on the number of players killed as a thug.\n(K)  A killer flag is earned by killing 3 players without dying in \n     between. The consequence is that {YANYONE{x may attack you. \n     The flag is lowered to a thug flag upon death at the hands of \n     another player.  When attacking somebody who origionally isn't \n     able to attack you, that person gains the right to attack you \n     until they have killed you.\n\nIs it worth it?  You decide.\n\n~\n\n52 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~\n.\n                         **********************\n                         ** The Rules of MHS **\n                         **********************\n \n1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.\n    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.\n \n2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. \n    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,\n    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    \n    and softening up or altering mobs.\n \n3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.\n    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly\n    go there themselves.\n \n4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.\n \n5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.\n \n6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie\n    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items\n    isn't.\n \n7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT \n    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some \n    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels\n    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).\n \n8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you \n    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore\n    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.\n \n9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  \n \n10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal\n    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.\n\n11) Do not argue with level 59 or 60 IMM's.  You're wrong, just admit it!\n~\n-1 PUFF~\nNo plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --\nHe grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.\nCompiles and simulations grew so quickly tame\nAnd swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.\nCHORUS:\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\nPuff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails\nAnd mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.\nAll the student hackers loved that fractal Puff\nBut DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, \"Enough!\"\n                (chorus)\nPuff used more resources than DCS could spare.\nThe operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.\nA gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,\nBut Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!\n                (chorus)\n~\n\n-1 CLIST~\nThis is a list of currently active clans on MHS.  For more details,\nsee the clan's helpfile \"help <clan name>\"\n\nHonor: A group of noble warriors, united in a common cause against\n       the evils of Boinga.\n\nDemise: A clan of bloodthirsty killers, solely intent upon the\n        destruction of good.\n\nWarlock: A clan of spellcasters, devoted to the preservation and\n         purity of magic.\n\nZealot: A group of religious fanatics, intent on preaching the word\n        of their God, and converting nonbelievers by any means\n        necessary.\n\nPosse: A militia who charge themselves with the eradication of\n       lawbreakers.\n\nLoner: Not members of a true clan, these warriors venture forth\n       into the dangerous lands of Boinga, with nobody to rely\n       on but themselves.\n\nOutcast: Once members of a clan, they have either left their old\n         life behind, or been banished forever for bring harm\n         upon their former brethen.\n\nSee the appropriate clan helpfile for more information, or speak with\na clan leader or recruiter (denoted by a rank of /5 or /4, respectively)\n~\n\n-1 RULES~\nThese are the rules of MHS.  For other matters, use common sense.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at ANY God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be\n  tolerated.\n\n* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods\n  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.\n  Please MAIL these bugs to: cascadia@nventure.com\n\n* Seerated player stealing or player killing.  Clanned players will NOT\n  involve non-clanned players in player killing in any way.  Non-Clanned\n  players will NOT intentionally involve themselves in player killing.\n  This includes spelling up clanners so they can go pkilling, or who are\n  being pkilled themsleves.  Nonclanners also cannot stand near pfights\n  and take disarmed weapons or fallen stones.\n\n* Summoning mobs and sleeping them at other aggresive mobs is forbidden.\n  If you summon Papa to the Dees and sleep Papa, and a nonclanner or \n  clanner gates to Papa, expect to be punished.  If you want to use Papa\n  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other\n  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive. \n\n  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or\n  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie\n  without their permission still is illegal.\n\n* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.\n  This includes using a script away from your terminal.\n  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.\n  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you\n  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your\n  typing woes, not play your character for you.\n\n* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with \n  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters, \n  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1 \n  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under \n  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are \n  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that \n  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,\n  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special\n  privileges. \n  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know\n  who someone's \"alt\" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over\n  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are\n  seperate.\n\n* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait\n  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between\n  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait\n  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.\n\n* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.\n  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.\n  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.\n  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too\n\n (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from\n  a pfight then dont take it.)\n\n* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless\n  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with\n  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the\n  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.\n\n* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and\n  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for \n  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are\n  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that\n  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To\n  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob\n  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with\n  them do not help them level.\n\n* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to\n  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.\n\n* Channel \"spamming\" and personal attacks on someone over public channels\n  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to\n  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse\n  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,\n  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.\n\n* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly\n  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you\n  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised\n  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.\n\n* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave\n  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while\n  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill \n  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT\n  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.\n  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal\n  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less\n  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.\n\n  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)\n  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)\n  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go\n   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).\n \n* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be\n  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have\n  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to \n  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage\n  character shall be denied.\n\n* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow\n  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is \n  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.\n\n* Other rules for clanned players are found in \"Help Clan\"\n\n* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and\n  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent\n  to Boogums (cascadia@nventure.com) \n\n* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty\n  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for\n  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could\n  increase the duration of your penalties.\n\n* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.\n  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs\n  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when\n  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base\n  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on\n  the web that have posting boards for such thins, such as:\n  http://www.mudconnector.com/\n\n* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same\n  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break \n  these rules.\n\n* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you\n  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means\n  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in\n  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your\n  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are\n  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.\n\n* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential\n  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so \n  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing\n  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or\n  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts\n  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections\n  are logged and will be watched.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be \n  tolerated.\n\n* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor \n  do the PEOPLE who run the game owe you anything.\n\n~\n\n0 SUICIDE DELETE~\nUse the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be\navailable for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,\nand you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will\nreturn your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the\nfirst delete.\n~\n \n0 HEALER~\nThe healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some\nservices are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see\na full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To\nreceive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.\n~ \n\n\n-1 GAIN~\nThe gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has \nbeen found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:\n\ngain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned\ngain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost\ngain apply :  turns 10 skill points into one practice \n\nGain uses practices to gain new skills, spell groups, and kits.\nGained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total\nnumber of creation points. \n~\n\n52 CLONE~\nSyntax:\n  clone obj <object>\n  clone mob <mobile>\n  clone <name>\n\nThe clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile\nthat may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in\nthe same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is\npreserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or\nmobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  \nStrung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.\n~\n\n\n0 SKILLS SPELLS~\nThe skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list\nof available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in\norder of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)\nlisted where applicable.\n~\n0 'SKILL POINTS'~\nSkill Points are rewarded to you for using your various skills in a \ncombat situation.  You cannot \"spam up\" a skill and get skill points.\nYou need to actually get out and do stuff.\n\nThey may be converted with the 'gain apply' command at the appropriate\nguildmasters into practices.\n~\n\n0 OUTFIT~\nThe outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with\na new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), \ncourtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.\n~\n\n0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT FULLSAC~\nMHS uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting\ngold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:\n\nautolist  : list all automatic actions\nautoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles\nautogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles\nautosac\t  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)\nautoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room\nautosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members\nautoassit : makes you help group members in combat\nfullsac   : able to sacrifice containers with items inside\n\nTyping a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. \n~ \n-1 CLAN CLANS~\nThroughout Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common\ncause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the\nspread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.\n\nIn order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,\neither by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name\nof their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4\nbeside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as\nfollows:\n\nYou must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast\nof any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either\njoined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.\n\nOnce you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If\nfor some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you\nmust first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  After outcasting you must\npurchase a voucher (not a cheap item) to gain access into a new clan. \nAlso, be wary, for those who make frequent changes in their clan find \nthemselves clanless quickly.\n\nExpect to be full looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your\nlife miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, however with that said\nthere must be an appeal to your humanity. Understand how full looting some\none makes them feel. Yes you've had it done to you, yes its a part of\nthe game. Do you really want to have a hand in driving off the player base?\nFind better ways to enjoy the game, help people stay and play.

Each clan hall area and \nbranch hall area should have/get a copy of the existing guard mob.\nhte only difference is, you remove the sentinal flag from the mob.\nyou also need to add the stay_area flag as well.  The name of the \nmob should be changed to 'roaming blah blah blah' so for Demise it\nwoudl be 'roaming guard of cthon' or something like that.  that way\nwe can find them easily.

Prices for training your guards or \nhiring new guards are found in the {YPRICES{x helpfile.\n\nClan leaders are responsible for the descriptions of the equipment, \nhowever stats and affects of the equipment has been predetermined \nand will be the same for all clans.  This is not negotiable or \nupgrade-able.  \n\nYou may have a maximum of 2 guards per room.\n\nA Guard Eq set consists of a helmet, a shield, gloves, a torso item,\nand boots.  \n\nBranch offices will be open to all clanners, that is\nwhy you have a guard, who will sound the alarm should an\nenemy invade your branch hall.\n\nYou will be provided one (1) one way door into your branch\nclan hall from the portal room of your Main hall.  To return \nto your main hall, you will have to use your traditional \nmeans of transportation.  The branch halls are nowhere, \nmeaning people scanning from outside your hall cannot see you. \nHowever, you will not be able to use scan from inside your \nbranch hall.

DOTs use a special, faster tick\nthat kicks in every 10 seconds.  When this tick hits, the DOT runs its course,\ndoing damage to the victim.  Some DOT spells also do direct damage up front, but\nthis isn't a requirement of a DOT affect.  Most DOTs have no cure, but do low\namounts of damage, so low they often fall under the damage curve.  But for this\nvery reason, DOTs are also quite powerful, as they can do hundreds of points of\ndamage and none of it gets curved.  The cost is time, as a victim of a DOT can\nuse several tactics to reduce the effectiveness.  Most DOTs last 1-2 minutes \nand do gradually less damage as they go.  Many things affect how much damage\na DOT does, and none of those secrets will be divulged here.\n\nThe Shaman kit is the best in the game, having access to an elite corp of DOT\nspells in the 'disease' group.

Loners and Outcasts, not being organized clans,\ndictate their own actions as they see fit.\n\n    The charters are there to define your clan, and to set rules for\nmembers of your clan to follow.  Leaders and recruiters are expected\nto know these rules, and explain them in detail to new recruits.\n\n    Charters are to be followed to the letter.\n~\n\n\n0 ABOLISH~\nUsage:  abolish <player>\n\n    Abolish is a Paladin-only skill that allows them to cure\ndiseases with a touch, by a direct act of divine intervention.\nHowever, a Paladin's god will not grant this power frequently,\nand there is a period of time the Paladin must wait before being\ngranted the power to Abolish again.

You MUST have the gold on you to set the bounty.\nBounties can be set anywhere at any time.  Bounties are cumulative,\nand will accumulate until the victim is slain.  They can never be\ntaken back.  You may place multiple bounties on the same person.  \nTo see who is logged on that has a bounty, type 'bounty show'.  The\nbounty will be automatically deposited into your 'gold' count once \nyou kill the victim.  There are some specific rules on bounties, see\n'help rules' for details.  Ignorance of these rules is no excuse to\nbreak them or the spirit of them.\n\n~\n\n0 'MEDIUM'~\n\n   The medium is a very simple kit.  The Medium is throughly connected\nto the physical world, and is able to enhance the regen of anybody in\nthe same room.  All hit point, mana, and move gains are increased by\na ratio to the medium's level for others in the same room.  This is not\na skill, simply an inate ability of the medium.

As such, they have access to five spells relating\nto this ability.\n\n  Spirit of Boar, gives a constitution boost.\n  Spirit of Bear, gives a strength boost.\n  Spirit of Cat,  gives a dexterity boost.\n  Spirit of Owl,  gives a wisdom boost.\n  Spirit of Wolf, gives a combat boost.\n\n  All of the spirit spells cost some skill points, and very little \nmana.  They are also all cast very rapidly.\n\nThe spiritcaller kit is available to all races, all genders, but\nonly if they are druids.\n~\n\n0 'FENCE'~\nFences are the consumate sellers of goods.  They are real smooth \noperators, classy, mobster type slick guys.  They use the \nconnive skill in their trade.  Fences also know about the secret\nback rooms that most shopkeepers have.  This allows fences to\ntrade while invis or hidden.\nThis being said, the social stat is very important to them.\n\nSee also:  connive\n~\n0 'CONNIVE'~\nConnive is the skill used by a fence when selling goods.  It\nalso allows the fence to talk their way out of \"sticky\" \nsituations every now and then.\n\nSee also:  fence\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD BASH'~\nSyntax: shieldbash <Victim>\n\nAvailable to Warriors, Blademasters, Samurai, Paladins, Berzerkers.\n\nShield bash stuns your victim for 1 round, and makes spellcasting\nmore difficult for a brief period afterwards.\n~\n\n0 'SYMBOL'~\n\nThere are four Symbol spells.  They are available to clerics and\ncrusaders only.  Their whereabouts and purpose are unknown.\n\n~\n\n0 'HAMSTRING'~\nSyntax: hamstring <victim>\n\n  Hamstring is a specialized opening move for Rogues, Thieves, and\nAssassins.  Hamstring does not require any special weaponry, and it\ncan in fact be performed using only one's bare hands.  When successful,\nhamstring costs the victim moves, some DEXTERITY, and applies the slow\nflag.  Hamstring will also strip haste if it's there.  A hamstrung\nvictim will occassionally have trouble when moving from room to room.\nHaving high strength and constitution not only reduces this problem,\nbut helps to avoid getting hamstrung in the first place.  Hamstring's\nimpressive array of debilitative affects are countered by its short\nduration and the fact that it cannot be used in combat, meaning the\nthief must give up on an opening backstab to use this manuever.\n\n~\n\n0 'ACCLIMATE'~\nSyntax: c 'acclimate' <target>\n\n   Acclimate attunes the recipient to the ambient energy of his or her\nsurroundings, making him/her regenerate incredibly rapidly.  If the\nrecipient of this spell does *ANYTHING* or takes damage from almost\nany source, the spell will cancel.  The recipient must remain absolutely\nstill to receive the full affect.  Druids only may cast this spell.\nThe spell can only be acquired via spell pages.\n\nThe location of this spell page is unknown.\n~\n\n0 'RESEARCH'~\n\n   Research is the skill that mages uses to create new spell scrolls.\nThe higher the skill, the more likely the mage is to successfully\ncraft spell pages.  Research is given automatically to all Mages\nand Wizards.\n\n   Currently most spell research must be done at the public magelab\nin Midgaard, which has recently purchased a MageLab 2000 research kit.\n~\n\n0 'REGENERATION'~\nSyntax: cast 'regeneration' <target>\n\n    This is a restoration-over-time spell.  It lasts for about 4\nminutes and heals a small amount of hit points during that time.\nIt is available to clerics, crusaders, and any hybrids that could\nbe old class cleric.  This spell belongs to no group and must be\nfound on spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'CRITICAL HIT'~\n\n    Critical strikes are a feature that is only available to classes\nthat can be old class warriors.  These are Warrior, Blademaster, Samurai\nBerserker, and Paladin.  If you are one of these classes and you are\noldclass Warrior, you will automatically receive critical strikes.  They\ndo extra damage based on your level.\n\n   If you are not an oldclass warrior but are one of these classes, you\ncan buy the ability to have critical hits by taking the 'enhanced \ncritical' skill.  This will give you critical hitting ability akin to\na warrior's inate ability.  For warriors, this will improve your chance\nof landing a critical hit.  For all characters with 'critical strike'\nthe damage curve is softened slightly.\n\n  Two other specialized crits are available.  'Bludgeoning' works with\nbash weapons, and 'Cleave' works with slashing weapons.  Both give an\nadditional chance to land a critical strike.\n\n  Note that you don't have to take enhanced critical to use cleave or\nbludgeoning.  \n\n Example:\tCleric Paladin\n\tHas no natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit', he\nhas basic crit ability with a soft curve.  If he takes 'cleave', he\nhas better crit chance with slashing weapons, and regular crit chance\nwith all others, and a softer curve.\n\n Example:\tBlademaster\n\tHas natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit' he has\nbetter chance to land a crit plus a softer curve.  If he takes 'cleave',\nhe gets a REALLY good chance to crit with slashers, improved chance to\ncrit with everything else, and soft damage curve.\n~\n\n0 'ENHANCED CRITICAL' 'CLEAVE' 'BLUDGEON'~\nSee 'CRITICAL HIT'.\n~\n\n0 'SUNBURST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sunburst' <target>\n\n    Sunburst is a single-target offensive spell.  It deals LIGHT damage,\nnot fire, and as such it has the potential to blind the victim from the\nintense light.  Sunburst does slightly less damage than the spell 'acid\nblast,' which is part of the basic training of most Boingan mages.\n\n   The origins of the Sunburst spell are unknown.  Researchers have\ndetermined that it is probably usable by Wizards, Mages, and Druids.\n~\n\n0 'SONIC BLAST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sonic blast' <target>\n\n    Sonic Blast emits a wall of mechanic waves that slam into a target in\na concentrated force, snapping bones and causing pain.  Sonic blast does\nslightly less damage than the standard Boingan spell 'acid blast'.   It\nhas the potential to stun the victim for 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of\ncombat.\n\n    Nobody knows where this spell comes from.  A leading researching at\nthe New Thalos academy of magic has suggested that a renegade mage may\nhave escaped into Altirin and developed the spell there.\n~\n\n0 'ADAMANTITE SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'adamantite skin'\n \n    Available to Mages and Wizards only, 'adamantite skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as adamantite.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.  The pages must be researched at the public mage\nlab.  The formula for the adamantite page can be found at the same \nlocation as one of the ingredients.\n~\n\n0 'INCINERATE'~\nSyntax: cast 'incinerate' <victim>\n\n    Incinerate is identicle to the 'acid blast' spell, except it does\nfire-based damage.  Incinerate is available to mages and wizards only.\nIt must be researched at the mage's guild in Midgaard.  The formula\nto create the spell scroll can be found at the magelab.\n~\n\n0 'STEEL SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'steel skin'\n\n\tAvailable to Mages and Wizards only, 'steel skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as steel.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'DIAMOND SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'diamond skin'\n\n\tDiamond skin is available to Mages and Wizards only.  It\ntransforms the flesh of the caster to a diamond-like substance\ncapable of repelling all damage.  Each attack lowers the duration of\nthe affect until eventually it fades completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF FAITH'~\nSyntax: cast 'shield of faith'\n\n   This self-only spell is available to Clerics, Crusaders, Paladins,\nDruids, and Monks.  A shimmering shield of protection is draped over\nthe shoulders of the caster by his/her deity.  The shield will absorb\nthe next several attempts to injure the caster.  The number of attacks\nit absorbs depends on the casting level of the caster.\n\n    This spell belongs to no spell group.  It may only be learned via\nspell pages and the Ritual.\n~\n\n0 RITUAL~\nSyntax: ritual\n \n   The Ritual is a rite by which religious classes learn new spells.\n To perform the ritual, the caster must be holding a spell page that\n has a copy of the spell he wants to learn, and be in an Altar room.\n The better the Altar, the better the chance of the Ritual being \n successful.  Four main factors influence the success of the Ritual.\n A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Level help the caster perform\n the Ritual properly.  But the inherent complexity of the scroll makes\n it more difficult.  \n\n If the Ritual is successful, the caster will receive the spell in his\n 'practice' and 'spells' list, and it functions like a normal spell\n after that.  The scroll is no longer needed, and the caster will never\n lose the spell.  It can be practiced and used like any other spell.\n It does not belong to any spell group.\n\n The caster must meet a level requirement for using the scroll, which\n is generally far lower than the actual level of the spell.  Whether\n or not the Ritual works, the scroll will lose 1 use.  Most scrolls have\n only 1 use, but some lesser scrolls may have more.\n\n The Ritual only works for oldclass clerics.  Oldclass mages will have\n to use study command.\n~\n\n0 STUDY~\nSyntax:  study <scroll name>\n\nThis command only works if your oldclass is mage.  It does one thing:  \ncopy a spellpage.\n\nIf the study attempt  is successful, the caster will receive the spell \nin their 'practice' and 'spells' list.  Once you have enscribed it, the\nthe spellpage is no longer needed.  The learned spell can be practiced\nand used like any other spell.  It does not belong to any spell group.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, 'spell pages'\n\n~\n0 'SPELL PAGES'~\nSpell pages are special scrolls that are found throughout the land of\nBoinga.  They enable an oldclass mage or cleric to learn a new scroll\nwithout having to gain the scroll from a Guildmaster.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, study\n\n~\n0 'REMOVE DISEASE'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove disease' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It \nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Disease is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks disease-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on plague or other non-DOT disease spells.  Remove Disease will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Disease gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 'REMOVE POISON'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove poison' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It\nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Poison is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks poison-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on 'poison' or other non-DOT poison spells.  Remove Poison will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Poison gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 SURNAME~\nSyntax:\tsurname <name>\n\n  Characters who have reached level 35 may select a surname.  This name\n  must conform to the same rules as first names.  You may have the same\n  surname as another character if you wish.  Nobody owns a surname, and\n  nobody has to have your permission to use yours.  Surnames can only be\n  changed by an IMMORTAL once set.  This is not normally done unless your\n  surname is inappropriate, or your character gets married and wishes to\n  take the surname of his or her spouse.  Surnames are only displayed in\n  your score and the who list,  and serve no purpose but for roleplaying \n  and fun.\n\n  You can toggle whether or not you see surnames in the who list by \n  using \"brief surname.\"\n\n~\n\n0 PREFRESH PFRESH~\n\nQ: What exactly is this prefresh I keep hearing about?\n\nA: Over the course of the almost 6 years MHS has been around, characters\n   have levelled under many different systems of gains.  In an effort to\n   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters\n   to \"refresh\" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that\n   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will\n   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years\n   and put everyone on a level playing field.\n\nQ: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?\n\nA: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you \n   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken\n   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all\n   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish\n   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation\n   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you\n   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.\n   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,\n   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.\n   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if\n   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal\n   creation.\n\nQ: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What\n   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after\n   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?\n\nA: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are\n   being discussed include giving out \"xp vouchers\" for the left over xp,\n   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally\n   decided, the answer will be posted here.\n\nQ: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?\n\nA: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through\n   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this\n   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc\n   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using\n   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can\n   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so \n   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.\n\nQ: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,\n   what good are they?\n\nA: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to \n   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you\n   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will\n   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices\n   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.\n\nQ: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.\n\nA: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending\n   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can\n   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills\n   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new\n   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that\n   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be\n   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it\n   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if\n   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.\n\nQ: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?\n\nA: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take\n   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the \n   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.\n\nQ: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my\n   practice sessions that way?\n\nA: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain\n   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up \n   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your\n   practice sessions.\n\nQ: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and\n   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?\n\nA: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your\n   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal\n   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,\n   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find\n   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.\n\nQ: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?\n\nA: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair \n   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all \n   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a \"stock\"\n   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly\n   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special\n   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special\n   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted\n   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of\n   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will\n   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.\n\nQ: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?\n\nA: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing\n   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we\n   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you\n   chose to change races.\n\nQ: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available\n   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?\n\nA: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and\n   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for\n   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes\n   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an \"old class\".\n   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level\n   and a few other things like delays on skills.\n\nQ: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?\n\nA: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the\n   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5\n   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,\n   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're\n   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will\n   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort\n   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.\n   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more\n   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be \n   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.\n\nQ: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want\n   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan\n   system?\n\n   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can \n   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be \n   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used\n   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader\n   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change\n   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,\n   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan\n   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).\n\nQ: What about my Mutant characters?\n\nA: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,\n   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not \n   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain\n   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once\n   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to\n   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you\n   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.\n\nQ: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I\n   think of something not covered in this help file?\n\nA: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had\n   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be \n   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that\n   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially\n   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding\n   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an\n   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either\n   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the \n   Admins.\n\nFINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of \n            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note\n\t    to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.  He'll consider\n\t    adding in your question if it hasn't already been answered.\n\n\n~\n\n0 MYRMIDON~\n\nMyrmidon\nConcept - The ultimate campaigner, the myrmidon is a classic soldier.\nThe military life is law to this kit.  Myrmidons live and die for the\nmartial life.  As a result of their rigid adherence to law and order,\nand the chain of command they tend to be strict and inflexible.\nHowever, the myrmidon is also highly trained in standard combat\nand is a skilled and powerful fighter.\n\nBenefits: \n* Specialization is free.  If the myrmidon has a specialization already\nwhen he picks up the kit, he'll be refunded the trains for it.\n* Because of their extensive training in basic combat prowess,\nmyrmidons, when using their specialized weapon, receive second\nand third attacks more often, anywhere from 125% to 150% depending\non the weapon skill percent and the myrmidon's level.\n* Also because of their extensive training, myrmidons receive a\nfourth attack skill.  With 100% in his/her specialized weapon\nand level 51, the myrmidon receives second attacks 75% of the\ntime, third attacks 50% of the time, and fourth attacks 25% of\nthe time.  These only apply with the specialized weapons.\n\nDrawbacks:\n* Because of their regimented martial life, these soldiers are less\nfamiliar with other fighting styles than their own.  As a result, they\nfight at a slight penalty when going up against creatures of a different\nsize (though not of a difference race if the race is the same size).\nThis penalty decreases as the myrmidon levels.\n\n~\n\n0 SPECIALIZE SPECIALIZATION~\nSyntax: specialize <weapon>\n\tspecialize help (displays this help file and costs)\n\nSpecialization is an option available to warriors and warrior reclasses\nSpecialization offers the warrior a better hitroll, more damage, and a\nremote shot at an extra attack.  Warriors and Blademasters may specialize in\nanything.  The warrior reclasses may specialize as follows:\n \n Samurai: sword, polearm, dagger\n Berzerker: sword, mace, axe\n Paladin: sword, flail, mace\n\nNote: In order to specialize, your oldclass must be warrior. IE a cleric\n      paladin cannot specialize, but a warrior paladin can.\n\n ~\n0 PAB 'PLAYER ADVISORY BOARD'~\nThe player advisory board (PAB) is an outlet for the coders to receive feedback about the major concerns for the game. Issues and suggestions brought forth by the PAB do not have to be implemented at all. Keep that in mind.\n\nEach clan will have 1 member on the board, usually the clan leader, but it can be anyone the clan decides to represent them. Clans can call for a change of representation at any time if the motion is supported by 3 different people, not characters. There will be 3 non-clanner positions on the board. Non-clanners will be appointed to the board by the immortal in charge of the PAB after having applied. These positions will be reviewed and possibly rotated on a monthly basis. Members of the player advisory board will receive an extra (PAB) flag by their name and be able to read notes posted to PAB. This will allow the other players to know who to talk to with their concerns. Being a member of the board is not something to be taken lightly, you will be required to post notes, attend meetings, and talk to the player base quite often.\n\nMeetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis. All other correspondence between the PAB will be through notes to all members, or through tells in order to come up with a working note to post. All members of the player advisory board will have their opinions considered, however the most popular idea will be the one that is sent on to the coders. Any questions about the PAB or its function will be answered by the immortal in charge of it at the time. No one else on the imm team is to be contacted concerning the PAB.\n\nImm currently in charge of the PAB: Hobkin\n\nMortals on the PAB have the PAB flag next to their names.\n\n\n~\n\n0 PYROTECHNICS~\n\nThe pyrotechnics spell group involves the creation of explosive materials.\nIts use is currently limited to samurai, monks and assassins. The spells \nare very powerful.\n\nsmall bomb: a small explosive device explodes on the target\nhigh explosive: blasts opponents with a larger bomb\nsmoke screen: obscures vision and allows an escape from combat\n\n**NOTE: Only Monks,Assassins and Samurai's get Smoke Screen **\n~\n\n0 NETHERMANCER NETHERMANCY FADE~\n\n   The Nethermancer is the most mysterious and unpredictable of spellcasters.\nThrough the art of {Cnethermancer{x, this kit can transfer hp to mana and vice\nversa as needed, at an exchange rate of 2::1.  This conversion is automatic.\nA perfect Nethermancer can only be destroyed when both his hit points and mana\nreach 0.  The Nethermancer also has a unique and uncontrollable ability to \nbecome completely invisible at will.  He cannot control when this happens and\nwhen it ceases, though he can force himself to become visible by engaging in\ncombat.  Nethermancers refer to this skill/annoyance as the {Cfade{x.  Finally,\nthe Nethermancer can bestow upon any weapon a special type of enchantment,\ncalled the nether flag.  What this does, nobody knows, and how the Nethermancer\nmanages to do it, nobody knows that either.  Nethermancers are automatically\noutfitted with a set of special robes.  If they lose their robes, they may use\nthe \"outfit\" command to get another set.  \n\nNethermancers cannot wear armor.\nArmor is defined as any item whose item type is armor.\n~\n\n0 BLADESINGER BLADESONG~\n\nSyntax: Bladesong\n        Bladesong stop\n\n   The Bladesinger is a special type of elf combatant.  Through the use of the\n{Cbladesong{x skill, the elven bladesinger receives a variety of bonuses in\ncombat, as well as up to a 25% chance for an extra attack during each combat\nround.  Bladesong can only be performed with a sword or dagger, and cannot be\nused if the bladesinger is wearing a shield.\n\n   Bladesong stop will end your deadly dance with the blades.\n~\n\n0 BATTLERAGER 'KILLING RAGE'~\n\n  The Battleragers are the elite corps of dwarven warriors.  Ragers are \nunstable at best, flying into insane fits of intense rage.  They can actually\ninflate their own hit points through the use of the {Ckilling rage{x, as well\nas receive a variety of other combat bonuses, including a chance at an extra\nattack during each combat round.  Battleragers can only perform the {Crage{x\nwhen wielding an axe, and cannot see their own hit point count while affected\nby the rage.\n~\n\n0 DAETOK~\n  Syntax: daetok\n\n  Dae'Tok is a Yinnish fighting style that cannot be learned by any other race.\nIt involves a style of trainin that Yinn are taught from childhood, and results\nin spectacular accuracy and maximum potential for damage with any form of \nweapon.  All Yinn become better with this skill as they advance in their\ncareers.  Dae'tok increases both the hitroll and damroll, and increases the\nchances of landing {Csecond{x and {Cthird{x attacks.\n\n~\n\n0 RANGERS~\n\n  The ranger is a master of the wilderness.  As such, (s)he fights most\neffectively in nature - plains, forests, hills and mountains, and is\nuncomfortable and ill-at-ease when indoors or in urban areas.  All rangers\nmay declare a species enemy (see {cSPECIES ENEMY{x), and will receive bonuses\nwhen fighting against any player or creature of that species.  The ranger's\ndislike of his/her species enemy is so strong that those creatures are \npenalized in defensive skills when defending against the ranger.  Rangers may\nmove from any sector to any sector for one movement point, and receive +3 \nmoves when they level.  They also may dual wield with any combination of\nweapon types.\n\nNOTE:  When the material table is complete, Rangers will be forbidden from\nwearing armor made from non-natural materials.  This means they'll be \nrestricted to leathers, cloth, wood, and the like.\n~\n\n0 'SPECIES ENEMY'~\nSyntax: species <race>\n\n   Rangers do not have to declare a species enemy, but the cost of this \nfeature is included with the price of the kits, they pay for it whether they\nuse it or not.  The species enemy must be a PC race.  Once you pick one, you\ncan never -ever- change it.  Select wisely.  Rangers fight remarkably well\nwhen going up against their species enemy, and members of that race don't\ndefend as well against the ranger.  You may not declare your own race as your\nspecies enemy.\n~\n\n0 'TUTINDEX'~\n\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n GETTING STARTED        Introduction to MHS\n TUT2\t\t\tPractices and Trains\n TUT3\t\t\tLevels and Rules Changes\n\n~\n\n0 'GETTING STARTED'~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n   Moosehead SLED is based on ROM2.3, so if you've ever played a ROM MUD,\nmany of these elements will be familiar to you.  If you are new to MHS or\nmudding, this file is designed to help you get started.  One of the first\nthings you will want to do is familiarize yourself with the commands.  The\n\"score\" command contains most of the relevent information about your character.\nThe \"worth\" and \"attrib\" commands show your gold/silver line and attributes\nlines seperately.  The \"who\" command lists all the characters that are logged\nin right now (that you can see).  Type \"equipment\" to see what gear your\ncharacter is currently wearing.  The \"inventory\" command lists the things that\nhave on you but are not currently using.  We recommend that you go through\nthe newbie school (type {crecall{x, {cup{x, {cnorth{x to get there) to get\na good head stat. \n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut2'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT2~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 2 \n\nTRAINS and PRACTICES\n   Your character improves by killing beasties and getting experience.  By\ngaining experience you eventually gain levels, which allow you to learn and\nuse new skills, spells, and abilities.  All new skills that you learn will\nbegin at 1% (except recall and scan, which start at 50%).  Although your skills\nwill naturally improve with use, you have to jump-start them by practicing\nthem.  A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will\neventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which\nthis happens is generally very low at low levels.  To practice a skill, you\nneed to locate a trainer (there is one in the Newbie school, follow the\nsigns to find him).  After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your\nclass to practice skills.  To practice a skill, you need to have at least 1\n{Gpractice{x session available (type {Cpractice{x to see how many you have).\nSimply type: {Cpractice <skill_name>{x, where <skill_name> is the skill\nthat you wish to practice.  Do not use quotes.  The skill you selected will\nincrease by a few percentage points.  The higher your {YINT{x is when you\npractice, the more your skills will increase with each {Gpractice{x session.\nThe highest a skill can go with manually practicing is 75%.  For anything\nbeyond that, you'll just have to use the skill and let it improve naturally.\nYou begin with 5 {Gpractices{x and you receive from 1 to 5 more every time\nyou level.  The higher your {YWIS{x is when you level, the more {Gpractice{x\nsessions you receive.\n\n   Your character also has 5 primary {Yattributes{x that summarize his or her\nabilities.  They are: {Ystrength{x, {Ydexterity{x, {Yintelligence{x, \n{Ywisdom{x, {and {Yconstitution{x.  See the individual help files for each \nfor detailed information on how they affect your character.  {YAttributes{x\nstart at a specific value depending on what race and class you selected. To\nimprove your attributes, you use a {Gtraining{x session.  You begin with 3\n{Gtrains{x and after that, you receive 1 more every time you level.  Your\n{Yattributes{x range from 3 to 25, and usually start out between 10 and 15.\nYou will want to train your {YCON{x and {YWIS{x first.  This action also\nrequires a trainer.  There is one in the newbie school.  These trainers are\nnot always the same as the {Gpractice{x trainers.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut3'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT3~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 3\n\nLEVELS and RULES CHANGES\n \n   As your character levels up, some of the game rules will change.  Also,\nyou'll be gradually forced to explore more the game world.  At level 6, you\nwill nol onger be able to enter newbie school, and must locate trainers in \nthe world somewhere.  Your character does not have to worry about the size of\nhis/her armor until level 11, and is able to use the {Crecall{x skill at will\nuntil level 11 as well.  After that, recalling requires the use of deity gifts\n(see {chelp deity{x), spells, or magic items.  The game will warn you about \nthese changes as you approach level 11.\n\n   When you level, it is in your best interests to wear what is called\n\"levelling gear.\"  Anything can technically be \"levelling gear\", but this\nterm generally refers to equipment that people only wear when they are about\nto level.  Usually this equipment gives you bonuses to your {YCON{x, {YWIS{x,\nand {YINT{x (see the helpfiles for each attribute for more information).\nWhere do you find levelling gear?  Ask around and explore, that is your best\nbet.  Note that when you level, the amount of experience that you need to \nreach the next level doesn't change.  Rather, you begin to gradually get less\nexperience for the same monsters.  You'll need to explore and find new monsters\nto slaughter that are more of a challenge.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut4'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 SPELLCRAFT~\n\n   Spellcraft is a special skill in which the spellcaster has studied\nthe metaphysics of spellcasting.  Those skilled with spellcraft are able\nto identify which spells other are casting, whether they are of the same class\nor not.  They also suffer a smaller mana drain when they loose concentration,\ncan sometimes cast a +1 over their normal casting level.  Spellcraft has a\nvariety of other, more subtle effects that make for a more solid \nspellcasting character.  This skill is incredibly difficult to increase.\n~\n\n0 BANKS BANKING DEPOSIT WITHDRAW~\nSyntax: deposit <#>\n        withdraw <#>\n\n   There is one banker in Midgaard, his name is Otho, he can be\nfound on clan road.  You may only deposit eggs into the bank, and they\nmust be in your inventory for you to do it.  Your total number of eggs\nin the bank is listed in your score.  You do not collect interest and \nthere is no minimum balance.  Your eggs are completely safe in the bank.\nNotice that unsavory individuals may hang around and attempt to steal your\neggs when you go to deposit/withdraw them.  The bank is not responsible \nfor stolen eggs.  \n\n~\n\n0 COLOR COLOUR~\n\n   Syntax based on Lope's standard colour code.\n\n   To enable color, type \"color on\".  To disable, type \"color off\".\n\n   This SLED automatically colorizes some elements of the game.  If you do\nnot like our colors, do not turn color on.  If you want to use only a few\nparts of color, get a client and utilize its color features.\n\n   You may use the following in any place to create color; notes, titles,\ntells, channel use, any where.  Please note that if you do not reset the\ncolor to 'normal', your color will bleed.  If you do this, you will be \nfrozen, so be very careful.\n\n    Red:    {{r for {rnormal{x, {{R for {Rbright{x\n    Blue:   {{b for {bnormal{x, {{B for {Bbright{x\n    Green:  {{g for {gnormal{x, {{G for {Gbright{x\n    Yellow: {{y for {ynormal{x, {{Y for {Ybright{x\n    Black:  {{D for {Dblack{x,  {{W for {Wwhite{x\n    Cyan:   {{c for {cnormal{x, {{C for {Cbright{x\n    Magenta:{{m for {mnormal{x, {{M for {Mbright{x\n    NORMAL: {{x resets colors to normal.\n     \n    Proper use of color:\n\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS{{x!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS{x!\n\n    Improper use:\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp>\n    {x\n\n    Get it?  If not, don't use it, please.  We don't issue warnings for\n    stupidity.\n~\n\n\n0 TRADE TRADING MUDTRADER~\nMudTrader 1.1\n\nSyntax: trade <cmd> <arg1> |amount|\n\nCommand Summary\n> trade request <character>\t \t- Start a trade \n> trade accept <character>\t\t- Accept a request to trade\n> trade decline <character>\t\t- Decline a request to trade\n> trade clear\t\t\t\t- Clear the current trade\n> trade cancel\t\t\t\t- Abort current trade\n> trade add <item in inventory>\t\t- Add something to the trade\n> trade add <gold|silver> <amount>\t- Add money to the trade\n> trade remove <item in trade>\t\t- Remove an item from the trade\n> trade remove <gold|silver> <amount>   - Remove money from the trade\n> trade show\t\t\t\t- Display current trade\n> trade approve\t\t\t\t- Finalize trade\n\nMudTrader is a special program that lets the MUD software act as a\nthird-party agent between two players who want to trade something,\nor purchase something from each other.  When you are trading, the money\nand items are removed from your inventory and held in memory.  If you remove\nthe items/money from the trade, leave the room, or cancel/clear the trade,\nyou get them back.  If you approve the trade, they go over to the other\nperson and are no longer yours.  When you are happy with the trade, type\n\"trade approve\" to finalize it.  BOTH traders must type \"trade approve\"\nfor it to work.  If anybody changes the trade, by either adding to it or\nremoving stuff from it, both people must type \"trade approve\" again.\n~\n\n-1 WIZLIST~\n\n        ________      ===============================      ________\n      /+_+_+_+_+_\\    |    The Gods of Moosehead    |    /+_+_+_+_+_\\\n      \\__________/    ===============================    \\__________/\n        |::XXXX|                                           |XXXX::|\n        |X::XXX|              Creator / IMP                |:XXXX:|\n        |XX::XX|               -----------                 |::XXXX|\n\t|XXX::X|        Rusty, The Oxidizing Dragon        |X::XXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|            Benefactor / Coder             |:XXXX:|\n        |XXXX::|               -----------                 |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|       Boogums \"BooglyDude\" McDugal        |::XXXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |:XXXX:|                                           |XXXX::|\n/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\                           /<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\\n\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/       Immortals           \\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\n       |.  /\\ . |            ---------------              |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Alagaster                 | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |               BriarRose  - ADMIN        |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |               KallaLilly                |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Karag                     | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|               Kuno - ADMIN              | . /\\  .|\n       | .//\\.  |               Slodhian - ADMIN          | .//\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       |.  /\\  .|                                         |.  /\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | .//\\  .|     Long live the memory of Mandrake    | .//\\  .|\n        \\. /\\  /         who left before his time.         \\. /\\  /\n         \\ /\\ /    [ IMMORTAL ] Grey Kellam : Mandrake      \\ /\\ /\n          \\/\\/                                               \\/\\/\n           \\/                                                 \\/\nArt by Blackstaff and Sara\n\nLast Updated By Boogums - 30NOV03\n~\n-1 HERO HEROES~\nThe list that follows is that of those who have attained the\nlevel of 52.

Here, anyone of level 52\nor higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the\nusual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;\nexamples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to\ncreation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,\nability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote\nplayers to immortality.\n\nSince immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)\na carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal\nbehavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without\nexplicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please\ndon't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or\nyou'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to\nthis file.\n\nThe duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,\nare topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are\nfraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)\n~\n\n-1 SOCIALS~\n \nThis is a complete list of socials for Moosehead SLED:\nCompiled originally by: Sara\naccuse       adjust      air          apologize     applaud     babble\nbark         bcatch      beckon       beer          bearhug     beg\nbird         bkiss       bleed        blink         blush       boast\nboggle       bonk        bounce       bow           brb         burp\ncackle       caress      charge       cheer         chuckle     clap\nclaw         collapse    comfort      comb          cough       cover\ncower        cringe      criticize    cry           cuddle      curse\ncurtsey      dance       daydream     drool         duck        embrace\nexplode      eyebrow     faint        fart          flare       flash\nflex         flinch      flip         flirt         flutter     fondle\nfrench       frown       fume         gasp          giggle      glare\ngoose        grimace     grin         groan         grope       grovel\ngrowl        grumble     hand         head          hiccup      highfive\nhop          howl        hug          hush          ignore      innocent\ninsane       judge       kiss         knee          laugh       lick\nlove         lust        massage      meditate      moan        moon\nmosh         mutter      nibble       nod           nudge       nuzzle\npant         passout     pat          peck          pie         pinch\npissed       plead       point        poke          ponder      pout\npray         propose     puke         punch         purr        ramble\nraspberry    rofl        roll         rub           ruffle      run\nscratch      scream      serenade     shake         shiver      shrug\nsigh         sing        slap         slobber       smile       smirk\nsnap         snarl       sneeze       snicker       sniff       snore\nsnort        snowball    snuggle      sob           spam        spank\nspit         squeal      squeeze      squirm        stare       stretch\nstrip        stroke      strut        sulk          swoon       tackle\ntease        thank       threaten     tickle        tip         tongue\ntwiddle      type        undress      view          wave        whine\nwhistle      wiggle      wince        wink          wonder      worry\nworship      yawn        yeehaw       yodel         rose\tlaces\ntank\t     starve\t aargh\t      homework\t    puff\tdiffer\nyae\t     lightbulb   voodoo       ogg\t    confused\tbeam\nbite\t     discodance  scuff        whap\t    lag\t\tchortle\nzerbert      twitch      roxbury\n \n~\n\n-1 MERC~\nThis sled is based on Merc 2.1, created by Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn.  \nMerc 2.1 is available as Merc_21.tar.gz from ftp.tcp.com and \nftp.math.okstate.edu.\nE-mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com' to join the merc mailing list.\n\nThanks to ...\n  ...

He was travelling the land and noticed that\nthere was power in the magical arts that was far beyond his or any others'\ncomprehension. He decided from that day forth to unite all pure spellcasters\nso as to fully understand and improve upon the arts of magic. He and his\nfaithful followers travelled the lands of Boinga to search out all those that\nhad the pure blood of magic in their veins. Those who would not join him and\nhis brethren were made to pay with their lives.\n\nHere we are left but a few proud spellcasters who have survived the trials\nof time. Now we shall rise again amongst the ashes of our ancestors. In our\nplight to truly unite the purity of magic, we have been forced to divide\ninto three sects.\n\nThose who adorn the White Robes of Warlock show the purity of magic through\nkindness. Their role in our clan is to guide all young spellcasters to gain\nknowledge of the magical arts.\n\nThose who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.\n\nThose who adorn the Black Robes of Warlock use the darker side of magic to\npunish the renegades who chose not to follow the true path, and defend our\nclan against those who would wage war. \n\nOur goals of the unity of pure magic has made us a very diverse clan, and for\nall those interested you may speak with any member of our clan and they will\nput you in touch with our recruitment officers.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements:\n  \n* You must be a pure spellcaster\n  (mage, cleric, elementalist, druid, wizard, crusader)\n   \nWarlock Charter (rules)\n*  You may not group with any clanner who is a:\n   Mage, Cleric, Elementalist, Druid, Wizard, or Crusader\n   They abuse the art and are to be killed on site.\n\n*  You may group with / help any nonclanner.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 RONOH~\n.\"It is a time of ideals,\n of leaders, of followers,\n of love, of friendship,\n of life, of death...\n of Honor.\"\n\nWE are the new generation of Honor clansmen and women.

They were a peacefull kind, only wishing to keep their \nrace going, raising cattle, and growing crops.  But as outsiders came to \nthe lands of the Goblins and tried to take over their farmland, it became \nobvious they would need some kind of defense, an army of some sort to fend \noff the newcommers.  And so was formed the Legion.\n\nThe Legion has one reason for being, and that is to keep the Goblins alive.\nIf you are a Goblin, and want to stand up for yourself in this world of\nraces far bigger then the Goblins, then the Legion is the place for you.\nThe Legion does not wish to seek out battle, we just wish to defend ourselves.\nAny race can join the Legion, but only a Goblin can ever hope to become\nanything more then just a guardsman.\n\nIf you wish to join the Legion, to help the Goblin race survive, you must\ncontact one of the leaders, or a recruiter, in a note or when you meet one\non-line. You must be able to roleplay, because the Legion is a clan formed \naround roleplaying and it is imperitive that you can do so to join this clan. \nIf you are a non-goblin then you may have to prove yourself worthy of \nprotecting the Goblins, because it would be a horrible thing if we recruited \nthe weak for this task.\n\nLONG LIVE THE LEGION!\n~\n\n-1 ELCRIC~\nThe Clan Circle\n\n    \"As one I am weak, but as many we are strong.  We are the Keepers of\nMagic.  We are the Magi of Clan Circle, Never Ending and Ever Lasting.\"\n\n    Magic.  It is the lifeblood of the universe.  It is magic that drives\nus, and it is in magic that we find true power.  This is the founding belief\nof clan Circle.  Through magic, any problem can be solved, any obstacle over-\ncome.  The main goal of Circle is to encourage and foster the development\nand increased use of magic, through the use of our own magic, power, and\nstrength.\n\n    The members of Clan Circle reside in the Tower, a massive building in \nwhich we work our spells.  Members of Circle receive free spell-ups, enchants,\ncorpse retrievals, and all of the other benefits that one would expect from a\nclan.  Although all clan members are expected to be willing to help others,\nthe Mentors of Circle are dedicated to this task.  The Guardians of Circle \nare the clan's military force, ready to fight at a moment's notice, and\nwilling to sacrafice their lives in defense of our ideals, members, and magic.\n\n    Roleplaying is *not* required to join Circle.  The only roleplaying\nthat is asked of all members is that you keep your characters seperate, as per\nthe basic \"no multiplaying\" rule of MHS.  We do encourage members to roleplay\nand develop their characters, but we do not require it.  Tithing of income\nis also encouraged but not required.\n\nCircle Leadership and Law\n\n    Circle is overseen by the Conclave, a council of 7 leaders who are\nelected or appointed from the clan.  There are very few defined rules in \nCircle.  We are a clan, we are Magi, we are family.  All members of Circle\nare given as much personal freedom as possible, and in return, we expect \nthat all members take responsibility for their actions, words, and beliefs.\n\nJoining Circle\n\n    Any race or class can join Circle.  Although our specialty is magic,\nand we generally only actively recruit mages and clerics, warriors and thieves\nare welcome to apply for admission.\n\n    The is only one requirement to join Circle.  Mages and Clerics must\nhave at least 8 spell groups, and Warriors and Thieves must have at least 3.\nBecause dragons are very difficult and timely to advance, the draconian spells\nare considered a spell group for the purpose of meeting this requirement.\n\n    If you wish to join Circle, talk to a Recruiter.  Any Inner Circle\nor Outer Circle is also a Recruiter.  If no recruiter is available, then post\na note to Circle, informing us of your race, class, and current level.  All\napplicants will be given a thorough interview, and some will be asked to \ncomplete a quest.\n\n                                  - Clan Circle, Never Ending, Ever Lasting\n~\n\n-1 LONER~\nLoners are individualists, standing alone from any Clan, but subject\nto the same rules as clanners with respect to pkilling, pstealing,\nand transportation spells.  By definition, Loners have no common\nhall, no leaders, and no affiliation among each other, save what they\nagree upon for themselves.\n\nTo become a Loner simply issue the 'loner' command between levels 5\nand 20.  This command -cannot- be reversed under any circumstance.\nDo it carefully.\n~\n\n-1 ECNALAB~\nIn life there are those who take, those who give, those who lead and\nthose who follow.  Seldom are they one and the same, but this is the\nland of Boinga, the land where the beautiful princess Alia once\nstepped. She had a vision, a vision of a family where to lead and to\nfollow to give and to take were equally respected by all who were\npart of the family of BALANCE.\n\nIn the days when Alia walked among us we were happy, at peace and\nable to console ourselves that we were no-one's master and no-one's\nslave. But Alia left this realm and chaos ensued. We strived to\nbecome what she had taught us and when we achieved it she did walk\namong us again.  Dissention was rife and soon after her visitation\nBalance fell under internal turmoil and deceit; the few feeling\nthat they took precedence over the many...\n\nAnd so this continued until one day few were left. They decided\nto make their own way and live the teachings of Alia rather than\nfollow them, throwing scorn on the likes of Riders those who would\nhave sheep rather than friends.\n\nWith that Balance was reborn!\n\nBalance is a family of members, none being any more important than\nany other. We strive for total equality and are in a constant\nstate of war with Riders, who see some fit to be ranked far above\nothers.  To join Balance just speak to any full member and they\nwill give you an interview (or arrange one for later). A full member\nis one who has been in the clan for 6 levels (or 20 days at 51). This\nis so new members have time to learn the ways of Balance before \ncompleting entrance into our clan.\n\nThe Current Speaker of Balance is Rigger.\nThe speaker of Balance is the person who is elected to be the\nspokesperson to the outside world.\n~\n\n-1 ESIMED~\nChildren of Demise\n\n        Darkness swallows light, death extinguishes life, and hope is but a \nfoolish dream. All things must come to an end, and the Children of Demise\nfaithfully help the end come quicker. We willingly bear the burden of life,\nso we can help the unbelievers on into the everlasting darkness. To enter\nthe darkness serving the faith is the greatest priviledge. To crush all\nhope and happiness is one the many steps to our eventual success.\nI, Eiji, am the father of Demise. I have come forth from the shadows to bring\nthe words and wisdom of Demise. There is no stopping our tide. We shall \nprevail.\n\nClan Demise\n\n        Clan Demise consists of a cult with a inner hierarchy. You rank\nis based on your level, your acts in the name of Demise, and your Role-\nplaying. Clan Demise allows pking, pstealing, and other cruel activities.\nWe work together as a tight unit, planning carefully all ventures.\nIf thou wishest to join Demise, expect a serious questioning from members.\nThey tolerate no stupidity, foolhardiness, or insolence.\nROLE-PLAYING is a MUST.\n~\n\n-1 DEMISE~\nAbove, in the planes of the Deities lies one of true evil.

We bare the burden of life to crush all hope and extinguish all life, \nmaking Cthon ever so much stronger! \n\nThose within our ranks have the privilege of serving the greatest evil.  As such\nCthon himself grants the elite army with speed and aura of fear that makes \nour enemies cower in fear with our power!  Possessing so much power we \nharness it and war with every existing clan, loner and outcast.  No treaty or \nbond between clans is powerful enough to stop our storm,  for we come for \nyou?always. In the words of wisdom of Eiji, the father of Demise, \"There is no\nstopping our tide! We shall prevail!\"\n\nClan Demise\n\nTo enter Clan Demise is a feat in itself.  Do not come looking for us.  We \nwill come to you.  Show us your power by killing and looting.  Any attack \non you consider it a test.  You must also be a minimum of level 15, and  \neven then, when we feel you are ready you fill be asked to join and no \nsooner.\n\nClan Demise is a cult of inner hierarchy, in which your rank is on the basis\nof your level,  your acts in demise, and other cruel activities.  If you do not\nmaintain your power and skills you will be outcasted and hunted by your \nformer clan.  No stupidity, foolishness or insolence is allowed, and  \nrole-playing is a must.  \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You must have a Thug or Killer flag\n\nDemise Charter (rules)\n{YGROUPING{x or {YWORKING{x with anyone outside the clan is *expressly* \nforbidden!

Teachers, Warriors, Healers, Sages, Young and old\nalike, they bind together under one holy creed. Seeking out the false\nfaiths and their unholy prophets, they continue steadfastly to cleanse\nthe lands of the evil that has spawned within the hearts of pagan\nmen.\n\nThese children of the Almighty, from all walks of life, are bound\nheart, mind, and soul to a common purpose, and a common name:\n\nZealot.\n\nThe faithful of the Almighty have but one purpose:  to annihilate the\nfalse faiths of the lands through any means necessary.\n\nNoone shall be considered neutral.

[*]\nThe members of the light are entrusted with the task of spreading\nthe teachings of the Almighty. They proclaim his holy glories to\nthe heathen nations, distribute holy scripture, heal and aid fellow\nbrethren in the congregation. They aid in the equipping and teaching\nof new recruits of the Almighty's Church. They may also aid in the\ncleansing of heathens or errant pledges, but this is not required.\nThey also aid the recruiters in bringing new recruits into the clan.\n\n/2 The Hand of the Almighty. [!]\nThe members of the hand concentrate their skills to the task of\neliminating false prophets and heathens. They seek out the heathen\nfilth and send their souls to the light via a bloodshed cleansing.\nThe creed: \"There is no forgiveness of sin without the shedding of\nblood.\" is very dear to them, and each has taken this crusade to\nheart. They also may aid in the gathering of new recruits, but this\nis not their main task.\n\n/3 The Crown of the Almighty. [^]\nThese members seek to enforce clan policy through intervention\nwhen the recruiters or the Anointed are unavailable. They report\ndirectly to the Anointed any violation that they witness within the\ncongregation, and are appointed only by the Anointed. Their prime\ntasks are the purging of false pledges, and to aid in collection of\nfunds of the clan.\n\nAll Ranks: Inquisitors.\nDue to vile forces of greed and lust, power struggles within the\nclan are all too frequent. The Inquisitors seek out those within\nthe clan whose faith in the Almighty and whose loyalty to the Anointed\nare weak or insubordinate. They report to the Grand Inquisitor or\ndirectly to the Anointed, who then deliberate on any action which\nmight be necessary to quell the disturbance. Who is an inquisitor?\nThat knowledge is only kept by the Grand Inquisitor and by the Anointed.\nAll inquisitors are chosen by the Grand Inquisitor or the Anointed. Any\ninquisitor who exposes his status can expect to have it revoked at best,\nor become an outcast at worst.\n\nRanks 1-3 are considered equal in all aspects, and shall be treated\nas such. No one rank is superior to the other, and should not become\nboastful over his brothers. Such boasting breeds intolerance and resentment,\nand is highly frowned upon.\n\n/4 The Preacher of Light, The Hand of Destruction, The Crowning Glory\nThe Holy Scribe, The Grand Inquisitor, Protectors of the Faith.\nThese select positions are hand picked by the Anointed, and given\nresponsibility of recruiting, as well as tending to their own\nbranch affairs. None possesses any rank above the other, and all report\ndirectly to the Anointed. These members also collect funds from the\nclan.\n\n/5 The Anointed of the Almighty.\nThese chosen children of the Almighty oversee all that happens within\nthe church of the Almighty. These people are said to be the direct\nvoice of the Almighty, and obediance of their decrees is required.\nThese people have complete control of the congregation, but may seek\nadvice on internal matters as they so choose.\n~\n\n\n\n-1 POSSE~\nA band of evil beings roamed the lands, spreading fear and chaos,\nkilling, looting, and bringing havoc to the world.  Within this band\nwere a few consumed with guilt, which could no longer bear the screams\nand death cries of the fallen.  Straying from their evil ways, they\nformed a Posse.\n\nThe Posse would no longer stand by and let criminals walk freely about\nthe world.  Thus, Posse attacks all KILLERS, THIEVES, THUGS, and\nRUFFIANS.  In doing so, Posse has made a few enemies along the way.\n\nPosse does not wage war upon any clan.  We strive to kill all KILLERS,\nTHIEVES, THUGS, and RUFFIANS, dealing swift justice where possible.\nTaking this into account, no member of Posse is to carry any of the \nabove flags, with the exception of the Ruffian flag.  We are of the\nunderstanding that sometimes excessive force is necessary, and also\nthat accidents _do_ happen.  Should other flags occur, each such incident\nwill be judged on its merits.  As a general rule, Thug flags are usually\nunacceptable at best and Killer and Thief flags are almost always an\noutcastable offense.  Exceptions can be made for bugs and extenuating\ncircumstances, again as the situation dictates.\n\nWe are not a group of individuals, we are a Clan family of sorts, in that\nwe help each other out whether it be pkilling, eq, grouping, spell-ups, \nor even just to sit and talk.  We do not group with those that carry\nflags, but will deal with them for goods if it is for the good of our\ngreater cause and they are deemed trustworthy enough to do so.\n\nPosse consists of those who are Good, Neutral, and Evil.  All races\nand classes are considered in joining, but we do not accept just anyone.\nPlayers are urged to talk to a recruiter at an early age/level as to\nnot invest too much time into a character who will be turned down.\nTeamwork is a _must_, as is clan/pkill experience.  Roleplaying is not\nrequired.\n\nSanctions will be handed out to those members of posse who have trouble\nfollowing the posse charter. These can be given by both /4s and /5s and\nwill generally last for the duration of your flag. However, if the /4 or /5\nyou ask to remove you sanction feels that you have not yet served your time\nthey will post a note to the clan stating why they feel that way and how\nlong they feel you should keep the sanctions. It will then be upto a /5 to\nremove the flag. Sanctions will be handed out as follows:\n\nRuffian - Skill, Store, Portal Room, Regen, Healer\nThug - Healer, Regen, Skill, Store, Portal Room, Hall for 1 week.\nKiller and Thief - Immediate outcast, no questions asked. \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You may not have a flag (see definition below).\n\nPosse Charter (rules)\n\n- any member of any clan that carries a flag (Killer, Thief, Thug or Ruffian),\n  is to be killed.\n- No member of Posse may carry any flag. Carrying a flag is grounds for \n  sanctions. The worse the flag the worse the sanctions.\n- Grouping with or helping any member of any clan with any flag is forbidden.\n~\n-1 SREDIR REDIR~\nAnd when He opened the seal there went out a horse that was red, and power was\ngiven unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that its\ninhabitants should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great\nsword...\n\nAnd behold there came forth an ashen horse, and he that sat upon him had a pair\nof balances in his hand; with a measure of wheat on one side and a mound of\ndust on the other.  And the power was given unto him to steal that which\nnourishes the body--and the spirit...\n\nAnd lo a black horse then appeared, and he that sat upon him bore a bow whose\narrows flew across the sky as an infectious cloud; and unto him the power to\ndisfigure and drain away the life of Man was given...\n\nAnd behold a pale horse arose; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell\nfollowed with him...\n\nAnd power was given unto them over the four parts of the Earth; to kill with\nthe Sword, and with Hunger, with Disease, and with Death...And lo there was a\ngreat earthquake; and the Sun became as black as sackcloth, and the Moon became\nas blood, and the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth...\n\nFor when the great day of His wrath has come...who shall be able to stand?\n\nMAKE WAY FOR THE APOCALYPSE...\n\n[Premise]\nWe are a lawful organization constrained by the inevitability of the End; we\nare but harbingers of the coming Apocalypse.  We do not seek out conflict or\ndestruction, nor do we believe in pkilling and pstealing with impunity.  Our\npurpose is not to bring about the End but rather to facilitate what inevitably\nmust, and will be.\n\nThose who wish to become minions of the Apocalypse must request an audience\nwith the proper Incarnation.\n\nWarriors should direct their requests for membership to WAR.\nThieves should direct their requests for membership to FAMINE.\nClerics should direct their requests for membership to PESTILENCE.\nMages should direct their requests for membership to DEATH.\n~\n\n-1 OUTCAST OUTCASTS~\nOutcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They\nare, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in\ntheir lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are\na few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:\n\n-- Attacking a fellow clan member\n-- Stealing from a fellow clan member\n-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan\n-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership\n-- Receiving a DWEEB flag\n-- Spying for another Clan\n-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention\n\nOnce someone has been Outcast, they may not rejoin another clan unless\na voucher is purchased, these cost 50eggs. \n\n~\n\n-1 DWEEB~\nDweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the\ngods themselves.  A Dweeb is given no safe haven, as they are allowed to be\nattacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can\nbestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for\na Dweeb flag:\n\n-- Continually spamming the public channels.\n-- Continually harrassing particular players.\n-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.\n-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.\n-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.\n-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.\n-- Using CB lingo on public channels\n-- Using l33t speak on public channels\n   (You don't look cool, you look like an idiot.  Real hackers don't use\n    it.  Quit watching TechTV.)\n\nNote that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings\nbefore you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to\nhave done something truly horrendous.\n\nAlso, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the\nperiod of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you\nmust live with it.\n~\n\n-1 MATOOK~\nHelp 'Matook'\nMatook is an organized group of characters that have shown interest\nin dedicating their time to helping out other individuals as they\ncan.  This can involve spell ups, retrieving equipment, corpse\nretrievals, enchantments, and other miscellaneous  tasks that the\nindividual is willing to do.\n\nThe helpers of Matook gathered together and created a Grand Church\nin the North-Western Corner of Midgaard. Here in the Church many\nhelpful souls can be found, as well they have provided fast healing\nand mana recouperation rooms for the needy.\n\nIf you believe in yourself to follow the ways of Matook and wish to\njoin their order be prepared to give an example of your skill and\nknowledge of Boinga.  You will be directed to speak with a member of\nthe Council who will bestow a quest upon you. Any Matooker will be\nwilling to answer any further questions about the the Church in\ngeneral and please don't be shy to ask for some assistance in any\narea. Of course, since Matookers are non-clanners, clan interference\nis always forbidden.\n\n\"One cannot love with anger and hate for fear will always ruin one's\nfate...To live a life full of peace one must love or see it decrease.\"\n\n-May Matook Protect You.\n\n~\n\n-1 DONATION DONATIONS~\n\nThe DIKU liscence states that I can not take any money from anyone \nplaying MHS.

This character has\nnot yet been refreshed. If you 'continue' you will go through parts of the\ncreation process allowing you to change parts of your character to better\nbalance you within the game. If you 'quit' this character remains unrefreshed\nand you can do it at another time.\n\nYou can test pfreshing a character by logging into the OLC Port instead of\nhere with this character. Login to sled.moosehead.com port 8080. Once you\npfresh a character on port 4000 you can not undo or retry it.\n\nIf you have any questions as to what this process involves we recommend\n'quit' and create a new character and read 'help pfresh' once you are in\nthe game and ask questions of the other players and Immortals.\n~\n\n52 JOBS~\nAs an Immortal on MHS, there are certain things expected of you, and\nespecially as a newer immortal, you should be mindful of exactly what\nit is you're supposed to be doing.  Below is a short summary of what's\nexpected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.\n\nNote:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.\n\nAll levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is\ncheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of\na higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings\nwith mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as\nyou would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of\nan Immortal.\n\n52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive\nor have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,\nsave to follow the same rules as everyone else.\n\n53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an\nImmortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how\nyou act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if\nyou are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be\nplaced at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the\nrules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the\nland, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of\nbeing an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob\nstrength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking\nquestions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.\n\n55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available\nto you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'\nstage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level\nwhere you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be\ngiven a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations\nat this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn\nOLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.\nYou have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any\nmajor decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced\nImmortal.\n\n57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to\nImmortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used\nto penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you\nshould have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,\nand a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at\nthis level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,\nbuild on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.\nYour conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but\nyou're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'\nonce you've reached this point.\n\n58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp\nof the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any\nsituation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to\nSenior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some\nof the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all\nImmortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected\nfor their dedication to MHS.\n\n59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still \nkeeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have\ntheir hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available\non MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,\nyou have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,\nor you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure\nabout, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS\ninside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins\nare also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new\ncode for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.\n\n60 - Implementor.  If you need to be told what your job as an Implementor\nis, you should probably put down the crack pipe now...\n\n~\n\n-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~\nYou may kill other players once you join a Clan or Loner.  If they are \nmore than 8* levels below you, you can't do it.  If your intended victim\nis not in a Clan, again you can't touch them (unless they have a THIEF \nor DWEEB flag). You may steal from other players if they are not more \nthan 7* levels below your level, and in a Clan. For either of the above \nactions you will recieve a flag and may have trouble with guards in town.  \nAlso other players may get to attack you.\n\nThere are specific ways to get certain flags:\n(Tf) A thief flag is gotten for failing an attempt at stealing from a \n     player.  You may be attacked by anyone up to 12 levels above you\n     when you have this flag.  It can only be lost by dying to another\n     player while you have no other flags.\n(R)  A ruffian flag is gotten from initiating combat on an unflagged \n     player. This flag has no consequence except saving someone who \n     attacks you from receiving a flag.  This flag is lost by dying to \n     another player.\n(Th) A thug flag is received if you actually kill a player. This \n     enables people up to 10 levels above you to attack you .  This \n     flag is lost by dying to a player either 1 or 2 times depending \n     on the number of players killed as a thug.\n(K)  A killer flag is earned by killing 3 players without dying in \n     between. The consequence is that {YANYONE{x may attack you. \n     The flag is lowered to a thug flag upon death at the hands of \n     another player.  When attacking somebody who origionally isn't \n     able to attack you, that person gains the right to attack you \n     until they have killed you.\n\nIs it worth it?  You decide.\n\n~\n\n52 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~\n.\n                         **********************\n                         ** The Rules of MHS **\n                         **********************\n \n1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.\n    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.\n \n2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. \n    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,\n    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    \n    and softening up or altering mobs.\n \n3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.\n    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly\n    go there themselves.\n \n4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.\n \n5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.\n \n6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie\n    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items\n    isn't.\n \n7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT \n    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some \n    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels\n    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).\n \n8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you \n    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore\n    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.\n \n9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  \n \n10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal\n    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.\n\n11) Do not argue with level 59 or 60 IMM's.  You're wrong, just admit it!\n~\n-1 PUFF~\nNo plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --\nHe grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.\nCompiles and simulations grew so quickly tame\nAnd swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.\nCHORUS:\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\nPuff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails\nAnd mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.\nAll the student hackers loved that fractal Puff\nBut DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, \"Enough!\"\n                (chorus)\nPuff used more resources than DCS could spare.\nThe operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.\nA gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,\nBut Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!\n                (chorus)\n~\n\n-1 CLIST~\nThis is a list of currently active clans on MHS.  For more details,\nsee the clan's helpfile \"help <clan name>\"\n\nHonor: A group of noble warriors, united in a common cause against\n       the evils of Boinga.\n\nDemise: A clan of bloodthirsty killers, solely intent upon the\n        destruction of good.\n\nWarlock: A clan of spellcasters, devoted to the preservation and\n         purity of magic.\n\nZealot: A group of religious fanatics, intent on preaching the word\n        of their God, and converting nonbelievers by any means\n        necessary.\n\nPosse: A militia who charge themselves with the eradication of\n       lawbreakers.\n\nLoner: Not members of a true clan, these warriors venture forth\n       into the dangerous lands of Boinga, with nobody to rely\n       on but themselves.\n\nOutcast: Once members of a clan, they have either left their old\n         life behind, or been banished forever for bring harm\n         upon their former brethen.\n\nSee the appropriate clan helpfile for more information, or speak with\na clan leader or recruiter (denoted by a rank of /5 or /4, respectively)\n~\n\n-1 RULES~\nThese are the rules of MHS.  For other matters, use common sense.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at ANY God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be\n  tolerated.\n\n* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods\n  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.\n  Please MAIL these bugs to: cascadia@nventure.com\n\n* Seerated player stealing or player killing.  Clanned players will NOT\n  involve non-clanned players in player killing in any way.  Non-Clanned\n  players will NOT intentionally involve themselves in player killing.\n  This includes spelling up clanners so they can go pkilling, or who are\n  being pkilled themsleves.  Nonclanners also cannot stand near pfights\n  and take disarmed weapons or fallen stones.\n\n* Summoning mobs and sleeping them at other aggresive mobs is forbidden.\n  If you summon Papa to the Dees and sleep Papa, and a nonclanner or \n  clanner gates to Papa, expect to be punished.  If you want to use Papa\n  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other\n  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive. \n\n  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or\n  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie\n  without their permission still is illegal.\n\n* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.\n  This includes using a script away from your terminal.\n  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.\n  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you\n  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your\n  typing woes, not play your character for you.\n\n* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with \n  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters, \n  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1 \n  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under \n  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are \n  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that \n  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,\n  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special\n  privileges. \n  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know\n  who someone's \"alt\" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over\n  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are\n  seperate.\n\n* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait\n  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between\n  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait\n  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.\n\n* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.\n  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.\n  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.\n  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too\n\n (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from\n  a pfight then dont take it.)\n\n* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless\n  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with\n  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the\n  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.\n\n* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and\n  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for \n  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are\n  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that\n  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To\n  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob\n  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with\n  them do not help them level.\n\n* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to\n  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.\n\n* Channel \"spamming\" and personal attacks on someone over public channels\n  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to\n  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse\n  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,\n  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.\n\n* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly\n  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you\n  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised\n  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.\n\n* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave\n  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while\n  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill \n  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT\n  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.\n  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal\n  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less\n  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.\n\n  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)\n  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)\n  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go\n   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).\n \n* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be\n  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have\n  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to \n  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage\n  character shall be denied.\n\n* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow\n  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is \n  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.\n\n* Other rules for clanned players are found in \"Help Clan\"\n\n* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and\n  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent\n  to Boogums (cascadia@nventure.com) \n\n* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty\n  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for\n  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could\n  increase the duration of your penalties.\n\n* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.\n  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs\n  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when\n  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base\n  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on\n  the web that have posting boards for such thins, such as:\n  http://www.mudconnector.com/\n\n* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same\n  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break \n  these rules.\n\n* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you\n  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means\n  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in\n  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your\n  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are\n  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.\n\n* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential\n  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so \n  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing\n  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or\n  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts\n  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections\n  are logged and will be watched.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be \n  tolerated.\n\n* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor \n  do the PEOPLE who run the game owe you anything.\n\n~\n\n0 SUICIDE DELETE~\nUse the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be\navailable for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,\nand you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will\nreturn your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the\nfirst delete.\n~\n \n0 HEALER~\nThe healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some\nservices are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see\na full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To\nreceive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.\n~ \n\n\n-1 GAIN~\nThe gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has \nbeen found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:\n\ngain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned\ngain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost\ngain apply :  turns 10 skill points into one practice \n\nGain uses practices to gain new skills, spell groups, and kits.\nGained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total\nnumber of creation points. \n~\n\n52 CLONE~\nSyntax:\n  clone obj <object>\n  clone mob <mobile>\n  clone <name>\n\nThe clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile\nthat may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in\nthe same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is\npreserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or\nmobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  \nStrung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.\n~\n\n\n0 SKILLS SPELLS~\nThe skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list\nof available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in\norder of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)\nlisted where applicable.\n~\n0 'SKILL POINTS'~\nSkill Points are rewarded to you for using your various skills in a \ncombat situation.  You cannot \"spam up\" a skill and get skill points.\nYou need to actually get out and do stuff.\n\nThey may be converted with the 'gain apply' command at the appropriate\nguildmasters into practices.\n~\n\n0 OUTFIT~\nThe outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with\na new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), \ncourtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.\n~\n\n0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT FULLSAC~\nMHS uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting\ngold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:\n\nautolist  : list all automatic actions\nautoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles\nautogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles\nautosac\t  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)\nautoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room\nautosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members\nautoassit : makes you help group members in combat\nfullsac   : able to sacrifice containers with items inside\n\nTyping a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. \n~ \n-1 CLAN CLANS~\nThroughout Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common\ncause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the\nspread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.\n\nIn order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,\neither by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name\nof their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4\nbeside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as\nfollows:\n\nYou must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast\nof any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either\njoined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.\n\nOnce you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If\nfor some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you\nmust first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  After outcasting you must\npurchase a voucher (not a cheap item) to gain access into a new clan. \nAlso, be wary, for those who make frequent changes in their clan find \nthemselves clanless quickly.\n\nExpect to be full looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your\nlife miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, however with that said\nthere must be an appeal to your humanity. Understand how full looting some\none makes them feel. Yes you've had it done to you, yes its a part of\nthe game. Do you really want to have a hand in driving off the player base?\nFind better ways to enjoy the game, help people stay and play. The larger\nthe player base grows the more fun you'll have and the more targets you'll\nhave. \n\nSee HELP CLIST for a list of currently active clans on MHS, and a brief\ndescription of the purpose of each clan.\n~\n-1 PRICES PRICE~\nPrice upgrades for clans\n==============================================================================\nThe prices below are for clans only.

Each clan hall area and \nbranch hall area should have/get a copy of the existing guard mob.\nhte only difference is, you remove the sentinal flag from the mob.\nyou also need to add the stay_area flag as well.  The name of the \nmob should be changed to 'roaming blah blah blah' so for Demise it\nwoudl be 'roaming guard of cthon' or something like that.  that way\nwe can find them easily.  For roamers in the branch halls, use the \nbranch hall area.  Let's try an minimize cross vnumming.

To return \nto your main hall, you will have to use your traditional \nmeans of transportation.  The branch halls are nowhere, \nmeaning people scanning from outside your hall cannot see you. \nHowever, you will not be able to use scan from inside your \nbranch hall.

The entrance to \nyour branch hall is a secret entrance.    \n\nClan leaders can purchase upgrades and additions for their \nbranch hall, but remember, all clanners can get into your \nalls and have access to anything in there, so build wisely.\nPrices for additions to your branch halls are the same as\nthose in the \"help prices\" file.

DOTs use a special, faster tick\nthat kicks in every 10 seconds.  When this tick hits, the DOT runs its course,\ndoing damage to the victim.  Some DOT spells also do direct damage up front, but\nthis isn't a requirement of a DOT affect.  Most DOTs have no cure, but do low\namounts of damage, so low they often fall under the damage curve.  But for this\nvery reason, DOTs are also quite powerful, as they can do hundreds of points of\ndamage and none of it gets curved.  The cost is time, as a victim of a DOT can\nuse several tactics to reduce the effectiveness.  Most DOTs last 1-2 minutes \nand do gradually less damage as they go.  Many things affect how much damage\na DOT does, and none of those secrets will be divulged here.\n\nThe Shaman kit is the best in the game, having access to an elite corp of DOT\nspells in the 'disease' group.  No DOT can rival the power of these spells.\nOther, more mundane DOT spells exist.\n\n~\n0 $~\n\n#$\n","position":146053},"values":[{"header":""}]},{"section":{"name":"specials","header":{"identifier":"header"},"tokens":[{"identifier":"command"},{"identifier":"id"},{"identifier":"special"},{"identifier":"comment"}],"subsectionTokens":[],"isRepeatable":true,"endRepeatDelimiter":"S","first":false,"data":"#HELPS\n\n0 ASSEMBLE~\nUsage:   assemble <part>\n\n    The assemble command is used to combine items with item_type \n\"PART\" to create a new item.

The victim will be notified that a bounty\nhas been raised on him/her, but (s)he won't know by who.  The bounty\nis measured in gold.  You MUST have the gold on you to set the bounty.\nBounties can be set anywhere at any time.  Bounties are cumulative,\nand will accumulate until the victim is slain.  They can never be\ntaken back.  You may place multiple bounties on the same person.  \nTo see who is logged on that has a bounty, type 'bounty show'.  The\nbounty will be automatically deposited into your 'gold' count once \nyou kill the victim.  There are some specific rules on bounties, see\n'help rules' for details.  Ignorance of these rules is no excuse to\nbreak them or the spirit of them.\n\n~\n\n0 'MEDIUM'~\n\n   The medium is a very simple kit.  The Medium is throughly connected\nto the physical world, and is able to enhance the regen of anybody in\nthe same room.

Their whereabouts and purpose are unknown.\n\n~\n\n0 'HAMSTRING'~\nSyntax: hamstring <victim>\n\n  Hamstring is a specialized opening move for Rogues, Thieves, and\nAssassins.  Hamstring does not require any special weaponry, and it\ncan in fact be performed using only one's bare hands.  When successful,\nhamstring costs the victim moves, some DEXTERITY, and applies the slow\nflag.  Hamstring will also strip haste if it's there.  A hamstrung\nvictim will occassionally have trouble when moving from room to room.\nHaving high strength and constitution not only reduces this problem,\nbut helps to avoid getting hamstrung in the first place.  Hamstring's\nimpressive array of debilitative affects are countered by its short\nduration and the fact that it cannot be used in combat, meaning the\nthief must give up on an opening backstab to use this manuever.\n\n~\n\n0 'ACCLIMATE'~\nSyntax: c 'acclimate' <target>\n\n   Acclimate attunes the recipient to the ambient energy of his or her\nsurroundings, making him/her regenerate incredibly rapidly.  If the\nrecipient of this spell does *ANYTHING* or takes damage from almost\nany source, the spell will cancel.  The recipient must remain absolutely\nstill to receive the full affect.  Druids only may cast this spell.\nThe spell can only be acquired via spell pages.\n\nThe location of this spell page is unknown.\n~\n\n0 'RESEARCH'~\n\n   Research is the skill that mages uses to create new spell scrolls.\nThe higher the skill, the more likely the mage is to successfully\ncraft spell pages.  Research is given automatically to all Mages\nand Wizards.\n\n   Currently most spell research must be done at the public magelab\nin Midgaard, which has recently purchased a MageLab 2000 research kit.\n~\n\n0 'REGENERATION'~\nSyntax: cast 'regeneration' <target>\n\n    This is a restoration-over-time spell.  It lasts for about 4\nminutes and heals a small amount of hit points during that time.\nIt is available to clerics, crusaders, and any hybrids that could\nbe old class cleric.  This spell belongs to no group and must be\nfound on spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'CRITICAL HIT'~\n\n    Critical strikes are a feature that is only available to classes\nthat can be old class warriors.  These are Warrior, Blademaster, Samurai\nBerserker, and Paladin.  If you are one of these classes and you are\noldclass Warrior, you will automatically receive critical strikes.  They\ndo extra damage based on your level.\n\n   If you are not an oldclass warrior but are one of these classes, you\ncan buy the ability to have critical hits by taking the 'enhanced \ncritical' skill.  This will give you critical hitting ability akin to\na warrior's inate ability.  For warriors, this will improve your chance\nof landing a critical hit.  For all characters with 'critical strike'\nthe damage curve is softened slightly.\n\n  Two other specialized crits are available.  'Bludgeoning' works with\nbash weapons, and 'Cleave' works with slashing weapons.  Both give an\nadditional chance to land a critical strike.\n\n  Note that you don't have to take enhanced critical to use cleave or\nbludgeoning.  \n\n Example:\tCleric Paladin\n\tHas no natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit', he\nhas basic crit ability with a soft curve.  If he takes 'cleave', he\nhas better crit chance with slashing weapons, and regular crit chance\nwith all others, and a softer curve.\n\n Example:\tBlademaster\n\tHas natural crit ability.  If he takes 'enhanced crit' he has\nbetter chance to land a crit plus a softer curve.  If he takes 'cleave',\nhe gets a REALLY good chance to crit with slashers, improved chance to\ncrit with everything else, and soft damage curve.\n~\n\n0 'ENHANCED CRITICAL' 'CLEAVE' 'BLUDGEON'~\nSee 'CRITICAL HIT'.\n~\n\n0 'SUNBURST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sunburst' <target>\n\n    Sunburst is a single-target offensive spell.  It deals LIGHT damage,\nnot fire, and as such it has the potential to blind the victim from the\nintense light.  Sunburst does slightly less damage than the spell 'acid\nblast,' which is part of the basic training of most Boingan mages.\n\n   The origins of the Sunburst spell are unknown.  Researchers have\ndetermined that it is probably usable by Wizards, Mages, and Druids.\n~\n\n0 'SONIC BLAST'~\nSyntax: cast 'sonic blast' <target>\n\n    Sonic Blast emits a wall of mechanic waves that slam into a target in\na concentrated force, snapping bones and causing pain.  Sonic blast does\nslightly less damage than the standard Boingan spell 'acid blast'.   It\nhas the potential to stun the victim for 1, and sometimes 2 rounds of\ncombat.\n\n    Nobody knows where this spell comes from.  A leading researching at\nthe New Thalos academy of magic has suggested that a renegade mage may\nhave escaped into Altirin and developed the spell there.\n~\n\n0 'ADAMANTITE SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'adamantite skin'\n \n    Available to Mages and Wizards only, 'adamantite skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as adamantite.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.  The pages must be researched at the public mage\nlab.  The formula for the adamantite page can be found at the same \nlocation as one of the ingredients.\n~\n\n0 'INCINERATE'~\nSyntax: cast 'incinerate' <victim>\n\n    Incinerate is identicle to the 'acid blast' spell, except it does\nfire-based damage.  Incinerate is available to mages and wizards only.\nIt must be researched at the mage's guild in Midgaard.  The formula\nto create the spell scroll can be found at the magelab.\n~\n\n0 'STEEL SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'steel skin'\n\n\tAvailable to Mages and Wizards only, 'steel skin' is a special\ntype of transmutation.  The caster's flesh becomes as hard as steel.\nAs the consequence, attacks bounce off harmlessly and do no damage,\neven magical attacks.  Each attack lowers the duration of the affect,\nuntil eventually it vanishes completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'DIAMOND SKIN'~\nSyntax: cast 'diamond skin'\n\n\tDiamond skin is available to Mages and Wizards only.  It\ntransforms the flesh of the caster to a diamond-like substance\ncapable of repelling all damage.  Each attack lowers the duration of\nthe affect until eventually it fades completely.\n\n    This spell is not in any spell group.  It may only be obtained\nfrom spell pages.\n~\n\n0 'SHIELD OF FAITH'~\nSyntax: cast 'shield of faith'\n\n   This self-only spell is available to Clerics, Crusaders, Paladins,\nDruids, and Monks.  A shimmering shield of protection is draped over\nthe shoulders of the caster by his/her deity.  The shield will absorb\nthe next several attempts to injure the caster.  The number of attacks\nit absorbs depends on the casting level of the caster.\n\n    This spell belongs to no spell group.  It may only be learned via\nspell pages and the Ritual.\n~\n\n0 RITUAL~\nSyntax: ritual\n \n   The Ritual is a rite by which religious classes learn new spells.\n To perform the ritual, the caster must be holding a spell page that\n has a copy of the spell he wants to learn, and be in an Altar room.\n The better the Altar, the better the chance of the Ritual being \n successful.  Four main factors influence the success of the Ritual.\n A combination of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Level help the caster perform\n the Ritual properly.  But the inherent complexity of the scroll makes\n it more difficult.  \n\n If the Ritual is successful, the caster will receive the spell in his\n 'practice' and 'spells' list, and it functions like a normal spell\n after that.  The scroll is no longer needed, and the caster will never\n lose the spell.  It can be practiced and used like any other spell.\n It does not belong to any spell group.\n\n The caster must meet a level requirement for using the scroll, which\n is generally far lower than the actual level of the spell.  Whether\n or not the Ritual works, the scroll will lose 1 use.  Most scrolls have\n only 1 use, but some lesser scrolls may have more.\n\n The Ritual only works for oldclass clerics.  Oldclass mages will have\n to use study command.\n~\n\n0 STUDY~\nSyntax:  study <scroll name>\n\nThis command only works if your oldclass is mage.  It does one thing:  \ncopy a spellpage.\n\nIf the study attempt  is successful, the caster will receive the spell \nin their 'practice' and 'spells' list.  Once you have enscribed it, the\nthe spellpage is no longer needed.  The learned spell can be practiced\nand used like any other spell.  It does not belong to any spell group.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, 'spell pages'\n\n~\n0 'SPELL PAGES'~\nSpell pages are special scrolls that are found throughout the land of\nBoinga.  They enable an oldclass mage or cleric to learn a new scroll\nwithout having to gain the scroll from a Guildmaster.\n\nSee Also:  ritual, study\n\n~\n0 'REMOVE DISEASE'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove disease' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It \nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Disease is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks disease-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on plague or other non-DOT disease spells.  Remove Disease will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Disease gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 'REMOVE POISON'~\nSyntax: cast 'remove poison' <victim>\n\n  Although the healers of Midgaard have been unable to learn how to counter\ndamage over time spells, the Drachlan Shamans do know!  This spell may only\nbe learned by obtaining a spell page and using 'RITUAL' to copy it.  It\nbelongs to no spell group.\n\n  Remove Poison is a spell available to Clerics, Crusaders, Druids, and\nPaladins.  It attacks poison-based damage over time spells.  It does NOT\nwork on 'poison' or other non-DOT poison spells.  Remove Poison will weaken\nthe DOT.  It may require several castings before Remove Poison gets rid\nof the DOT entirely.\n~\n\n0 SURNAME~\nSyntax:\tsurname <name>\n\n  Characters who have reached level 35 may select a surname.  This name\n  must conform to the same rules as first names.  You may have the same\n  surname as another character if you wish.  Nobody owns a surname, and\n  nobody has to have your permission to use yours.  Surnames can only be\n  changed by an IMMORTAL once set.  This is not normally done unless your\n  surname is inappropriate, or your character gets married and wishes to\n  take the surname of his or her spouse.  Surnames are only displayed in\n  your score and the who list,  and serve no purpose but for roleplaying \n  and fun.\n\n  You can toggle whether or not you see surnames in the who list by \n  using \"brief surname.\"\n\n~\n\n0 PREFRESH PFRESH~\n\nQ: What exactly is this prefresh I keep hearing about?\n\nA: Over the course of the almost 6 years MHS has been around, characters\n   have levelled under many different systems of gains.  In an effort to\n   address this issue, the administration has decided to allow all characters\n   to \"refresh\" themselves, and thereby take full advantage of things that\n   might not have existed when they first created.  This refresh will\n   eliminate the cumulative affects of many different changes over the years\n   and put everyone on a level playing field.\n\nQ: Okay, that explains why we're doing this, but how's it all going to work?\n\nA: When the prefresh happens, you will log into the game just like you \n   always do.  If your character hasn't been prefreshed yet, you'll be taken\n   directly to the character creation screen, where you will go through all\n   the stuff you did the first time you made your character.  After you finish\n   selecting all your skills, improving your stats etc, your new cp (creation\n   points) will be calculated.  Using this new value, and the experience you\n   had earned before the prefresh, you will be given a bunch of debit levels.\n   The only things that will stay the same about your character are your name,\n   and your sex.  Everything else you will be allowed to choose again.\n   This includes your class, your alignment,, your race, your old class (if\n   applicable), your skills and anything else that takes place during normal\n   creation.\n\nQ: That's all well and good, but there's this creation point cap now.  What\n   if the experience I earned before the prefresh is so much that after\n   refreshing and recreating, I end up with a bunch of leftover experience?\n\nA: This particular topic is still under discussion.  Some ideas that are\n   being discussed include giving out \"xp vouchers\" for the left over xp,\n   or giving out skill points for the leftover xp.  When this is finally\n   decided, the answer will be posted here.\n\nQ: Skill points? What the hell are you talking about man?\n\nA: Currently, the only way to gain new skills, or to gain kits is through\n   the use of trains.  After the prefresh, you won't be able to do this\n   anymore.  Instead, you will gain new skills, kits, specialization etc\n   using skill points and/or practices.  You gain skill points by using\n   your skills.  The more you use your skills, the more skill points you can\n   get.  There is a limit to the number you can gain in an hour though, so \n   don't be surprised to see your skill points come in spurts.\n\nQ: Well, if I can't use my trains to gain stuff, take a kit or specialize,\n   what good are they?\n\nA: Trains will be used to increase your stats (strength, wisdom, etc.), or to \n   increase your hp, mana, or movement.  You will get 1 train every time you\n   level, plus a few when you start out.  These are the only trains you will\n   ever get, so use them wisely.  Yes, that means no more converting practices\n   to trains.  Practices will have other uses now.\n\nQ: Okay, give me the low down on practices then.\n\nA: Practices can be earned in two ways.  You get some when you level, depending\n   on your wisdom, or you can convert skill points into practices.  You can\n   use your practices for several things.  They can be used to practice skills\n   and/or spells, just like now.  You can use them to gain a kit, to gain a new\n   skill or spell group, or you can use them to specialize (if you have that\n   option available to your class).  The costs for all these things will be\n   adjusted to show you the cost in practices, instead of in trains, as it\n   is now.  The conversion rate will be 10 practices to one train.  So, if\n   a skill used to cost 4 trains to gain, it will now cost 40 practices instead.\n\nQ: What about the skills I already had practiced? Do I get to keep those?\n\nA: You will have the option, when practicing a skill again, to either take\n   your old skill level (%) for a cost of 1 practice, or to take the \n   normal amount a practice would give you for that skill.\n\nQ: Wait.  Why would I not want to take my old percent, won't I get more for my\n   practice sessions that way?\n\nA: Sure you will, but when you do that, you won't have the opportunity to gain\n   the experience that goes with increasing a skill, and you also will end up \n   with fewer skill points.  The choice is yours in how to best apply your\n   practice sessions.\n\nQ: Okay, I think I understand all that, but if I used to be level 40, and\n   I have to recreate, won't all my equipment disappear?\n\nA: Special instructions have been included in the code to compensate for your\n   new level.  You will have 5 logins after the prefresh where the normal\n   equipment level restrictions will not apply.  During these 5 logins,\n   you should easily be able to get yourself back to your old level, or find\n   someone to hold onto your things for you until you can.\n\nQ: What about my restrings and enchants?  Do I get to keep those too?\n\nA: Part of the reason we're doing this prefresh is get rid of unfair \n   equipment that was given out in quests.  In order to do this all \n   equipment you have when you refresh will be replaced with a \"stock\"\n   equivalent of the item.  The exceptions to this are restrings and highly\n   enchanted eq.  Any restrung eq you have will retain it's special\n   descriptions.  This means you won't have to worry about that special\n   wedding ring your MUD wife had created for you.  Highly enchanted\n   equipment will also retain some of it's enchants, to a maximum of\n   +8hit/+8damage.  The exact method of how the new enchant level will\n   be calculated hasn't been determined yet.\n\nQ: What bout warps? Will my equipment still be the right size?\n\nA: Since you can change your race, it was decided that the best thing\n   for everyone would be to remove existing warps on equipment.  If we\n   didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to wear most your gear if you\n   chose to change races.\n\nQ: I heard that the things we used to call reclasses are going to be available\n   right from the creation screen.  Is this true?\n\nA: Yes it is.  MHS will do away with our current class->reclass structure and\n   go to a simplified version of it.  Now, you will have 11 choices of for\n   your class right from when you create.  If you do choose one the classes\n   that used to be a reclass, you will be prompted to choose an \"old class\".\n   This is used exactly how old class is used now, to calculate casting level\n   and a few other things like delays on skills.\n\nQ: So, no more reclasses. Fine, what about remorts then?\n\nA: If you were a remort before the prefresh, you will be creditted for the\n   xp you earned before remorting.  So, you will actually get credit for 1.5\n   times your current xp, if you are level 51.  Don't worry about the math,\n   just understand that we're taking remort status into account when we're\n   calculating how much xp you have.  As for your remort status, that will\n   gone.  If you have enough debit levels after refreshing, you can remort\n   again, and use your remaining debit levels to level back up after remorting.\n   Note: Only those that are currently remorted can possibly be granted more\n   than 50 debit levels.  If you are not a current remort, you will NOT be \n   able to use your extra experience to gain levels after remorting.\n\nQ: What bout my clan?  Do I have to stay in the clan system if I don't want\n   to be?  Can I change clans? If I was a non-clanner, can I join the clan\n   system?\n\n   We've decided to not store your old clan status.  That means you can \n   change anything and everything about it if you want.  You used to be \n   in a clan, and want to be a non-clanner now?  No problem.  You used\n   to be in Honor, and want to be in Demise now?  Check with the leader\n   of the clan you want to join, maybe they'll take you.  The only change\n   to clan status at all will be if you are an Outcast.  If you an Outcast,\n   your Outcast timer will be set to 0, and you'll be permitted to clan\n   again whenever you want (subject to the normal level restrictions).\n\nQ: What about my Mutant characters?\n\nA: We are currently discussing how to best implement and change mutants,\n   this takes intensive discussions and changes and therefore is not \n   going to be completed for the pfresh. If you want your Mutant to remain\n   a mutant (assuming they ever get imped) then do not pfresh them. Once\n   you pfresh you will select a race and will not be able to go back to\n   mutant. A news will be posted when and if Mutants are returning and you\n   can pfresh a mutant character in the future.\n\nQ: Ok, I really think I'm starting to get it now.  What should I do if I\n   think of something not covered in this help file?\n\nA: Your best bet is to first ask around.  Chances are someone else has had\n   the same question as you.  If the answer isn't here, it might be \n   in one of the many news articles posted about the prefresh.  If that\n   doesn't answer your question, ask one of the Admins (especially\n   Rage, Poquah or Minister).  These are the guys that are actually coding\n   this prefresh, so they usually have the answers.  If you can't find an\n   Admin, post an idea note with your question.  It will be answered either\n   by the general MUD populace, who can sometimes be wrong, or one of the \n   Admins.\n\nFINAL NOTE: This help file is by no means comprehensive.  If you can think of \n            something that should be included but isn't, please send a note\n\t    to Rage, the writer of this particular help file.  He'll consider\n\t    adding in your question if it hasn't already been answered.\n\n\n~\n\n0 MYRMIDON~\n\nMyrmidon\nConcept - The ultimate campaigner, the myrmidon is a classic soldier.\nThe military life is law to this kit.  Myrmidons live and die for the\nmartial life.  As a result of their rigid adherence to law and order,\nand the chain of command they tend to be strict and inflexible.\nHowever, the myrmidon is also highly trained in standard combat\nand is a skilled and powerful fighter.\n\nBenefits: \n* Specialization is free.  If the myrmidon has a specialization already\nwhen he picks up the kit, he'll be refunded the trains for it.\n* Because of their extensive training in basic combat prowess,\nmyrmidons, when using their specialized weapon, receive second\nand third attacks more often, anywhere from 125% to 150% depending\non the weapon skill percent and the myrmidon's level.\n* Also because of their extensive training, myrmidons receive a\nfourth attack skill.  With 100% in his/her specialized weapon\nand level 51, the myrmidon receives second attacks 75% of the\ntime, third attacks 50% of the time, and fourth attacks 25% of\nthe time.  These only apply with the specialized weapons.\n\nDrawbacks:\n* Because of their regimented martial life, these soldiers are less\nfamiliar with other fighting styles than their own.  As a result, they\nfight at a slight penalty when going up against creatures of a different\nsize (though not of a difference race if the race is the same size).\nThis penalty decreases as the myrmidon levels.\n\n~\n\n0 SPECIALIZE SPECIALIZATION~\nSyntax: specialize <weapon>\n\tspecialize help (displays this help file and costs)\n\nSpecialization is an option available to warriors and warrior reclasses\nSpecialization offers the warrior a better hitroll, more damage, and a\nremote shot at an extra attack.  Warriors and Blademasters may specialize in\nanything.  The warrior reclasses may specialize as follows:\n \n Samurai: sword, polearm, dagger\n Berzerker: sword, mace, axe\n Paladin: sword, flail, mace\n\nNote: In order to specialize, your oldclass must be warrior. IE a cleric\n      paladin cannot specialize, but a warrior paladin can.\n\n ~\n0 PAB 'PLAYER ADVISORY BOARD'~\nThe player advisory board (PAB) is an outlet for the coders to receive feedback about the major concerns for the game. Issues and suggestions brought forth by the PAB do not have to be implemented at all. Keep that in mind.\n\nEach clan will have 1 member on the board, usually the clan leader, but it can be anyone the clan decides to represent them. Clans can call for a change of representation at any time if the motion is supported by 3 different people, not characters. There will be 3 non-clanner positions on the board. Non-clanners will be appointed to the board by the immortal in charge of the PAB after having applied. These positions will be reviewed and possibly rotated on a monthly basis. Members of the player advisory board will receive an extra (PAB) flag by their name and be able to read notes posted to PAB. This will allow the other players to know who to talk to with their concerns. Being a member of the board is not something to be taken lightly, you will be required to post notes, attend meetings, and talk to the player base quite often.\n\nMeetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis. All other correspondence between the PAB will be through notes to all members, or through tells in order to come up with a working note to post. All members of the player advisory board will have their opinions considered, however the most popular idea will be the one that is sent on to the coders. Any questions about the PAB or its function will be answered by the immortal in charge of it at the time. No one else on the imm team is to be contacted concerning the PAB.\n\nImm currently in charge of the PAB: Hobkin\n\nMortals on the PAB have the PAB flag next to their names.\n\n\n~\n\n0 PYROTECHNICS~\n\nThe pyrotechnics spell group involves the creation of explosive materials.\nIts use is currently limited to samurai, monks and assassins. The spells \nare very powerful.\n\nsmall bomb: a small explosive device explodes on the target\nhigh explosive: blasts opponents with a larger bomb\nsmoke screen: obscures vision and allows an escape from combat\n\n**NOTE: Only Monks,Assassins and Samurai's get Smoke Screen **\n~\n\n0 NETHERMANCER NETHERMANCY FADE~\n\n   The Nethermancer is the most mysterious and unpredictable of spellcasters.\nThrough the art of {Cnethermancer{x, this kit can transfer hp to mana and vice\nversa as needed, at an exchange rate of 2::1.  This conversion is automatic.\nA perfect Nethermancer can only be destroyed when both his hit points and mana\nreach 0.  The Nethermancer also has a unique and uncontrollable ability to \nbecome completely invisible at will.  He cannot control when this happens and\nwhen it ceases, though he can force himself to become visible by engaging in\ncombat.  Nethermancers refer to this skill/annoyance as the {Cfade{x.  Finally,\nthe Nethermancer can bestow upon any weapon a special type of enchantment,\ncalled the nether flag.  What this does, nobody knows, and how the Nethermancer\nmanages to do it, nobody knows that either.  Nethermancers are automatically\noutfitted with a set of special robes.  If they lose their robes, they may use\nthe \"outfit\" command to get another set.  \n\nNethermancers cannot wear armor.\nArmor is defined as any item whose item type is armor.\n~\n\n0 BLADESINGER BLADESONG~\n\nSyntax: Bladesong\n        Bladesong stop\n\n   The Bladesinger is a special type of elf combatant.  Through the use of the\n{Cbladesong{x skill, the elven bladesinger receives a variety of bonuses in\ncombat, as well as up to a 25% chance for an extra attack during each combat\nround.  Bladesong can only be performed with a sword or dagger, and cannot be\nused if the bladesinger is wearing a shield.\n\n   Bladesong stop will end your deadly dance with the blades.\n~\n\n0 BATTLERAGER 'KILLING RAGE'~\n\n  The Battleragers are the elite corps of dwarven warriors.  Ragers are \nunstable at best, flying into insane fits of intense rage.  They can actually\ninflate their own hit points through the use of the {Ckilling rage{x, as well\nas receive a variety of other combat bonuses, including a chance at an extra\nattack during each combat round.  Battleragers can only perform the {Crage{x\nwhen wielding an axe, and cannot see their own hit point count while affected\nby the rage.\n~\n\n0 DAETOK~\n  Syntax: daetok\n\n  Dae'Tok is a Yinnish fighting style that cannot be learned by any other race.\nIt involves a style of trainin that Yinn are taught from childhood, and results\nin spectacular accuracy and maximum potential for damage with any form of \nweapon.  All Yinn become better with this skill as they advance in their\ncareers.  Dae'tok increases both the hitroll and damroll, and increases the\nchances of landing {Csecond{x and {Cthird{x attacks.\n\n~\n\n0 RANGERS~\n\n  The ranger is a master of the wilderness.  As such, (s)he fights most\neffectively in nature - plains, forests, hills and mountains, and is\nuncomfortable and ill-at-ease when indoors or in urban areas.  All rangers\nmay declare a species enemy (see {cSPECIES ENEMY{x), and will receive bonuses\nwhen fighting against any player or creature of that species.  The ranger's\ndislike of his/her species enemy is so strong that those creatures are \npenalized in defensive skills when defending against the ranger.  Rangers may\nmove from any sector to any sector for one movement point, and receive +3 \nmoves when they level.  They also may dual wield with any combination of\nweapon types.\n\nNOTE:  When the material table is complete, Rangers will be forbidden from\nwearing armor made from non-natural materials.  This means they'll be \nrestricted to leathers, cloth, wood, and the like.\n~\n\n0 'SPECIES ENEMY'~\nSyntax: species <race>\n\n   Rangers do not have to declare a species enemy, but the cost of this \nfeature is included with the price of the kits, they pay for it whether they\nuse it or not.  The species enemy must be a PC race.  Once you pick one, you\ncan never -ever- change it.  Select wisely.  Rangers fight remarkably well\nwhen going up against their species enemy, and members of that race don't\ndefend as well against the ranger.  You may not declare your own race as your\nspecies enemy.\n~\n\n0 'TUTINDEX'~\n\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n GETTING STARTED        Introduction to MHS\n TUT2\t\t\tPractices and Trains\n TUT3\t\t\tLevels and Rules Changes\n\n~\n\n0 'GETTING STARTED'~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial\n\n   Moosehead SLED is based on ROM2.3, so if you've ever played a ROM MUD,\nmany of these elements will be familiar to you.  If you are new to MHS or\nmudding, this file is designed to help you get started.  One of the first\nthings you will want to do is familiarize yourself with the commands.  The\n\"score\" command contains most of the relevent information about your character.\nThe \"worth\" and \"attrib\" commands show your gold/silver line and attributes\nlines seperately.  The \"who\" command lists all the characters that are logged\nin right now (that you can see).  Type \"equipment\" to see what gear your\ncharacter is currently wearing.  The \"inventory\" command lists the things that\nhave on you but are not currently using.  We recommend that you go through\nthe newbie school (type {crecall{x, {cup{x, {cnorth{x to get there) to get\na good head stat. \n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut2'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT2~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 2 \n\nTRAINS and PRACTICES\n   Your character improves by killing beasties and getting experience.  By\ngaining experience you eventually gain levels, which allow you to learn and\nuse new skills, spells, and abilities.  All new skills that you learn will\nbegin at 1% (except recall and scan, which start at 50%).  Although your skills\nwill naturally improve with use, you have to jump-start them by practicing\nthem.  A skill at 1% will never improve.  Any skill at 2% or greater will\neventually begin to go up just by using it, although the frequency at which\nthis happens is generally very low at low levels.  To practice a skill, you\nneed to locate a trainer (there is one in the Newbie school, follow the\nsigns to find him).  After level 5, you'll have to find the guild for your\nclass to practice skills.  To practice a skill, you need to have at least 1\n{Gpractice{x session available (type {Cpractice{x to see how many you have).\nSimply type: {Cpractice <skill_name>{x, where <skill_name> is the skill\nthat you wish to practice.  Do not use quotes.  The skill you selected will\nincrease by a few percentage points.  The higher your {YINT{x is when you\npractice, the more your skills will increase with each {Gpractice{x session.\nThe highest a skill can go with manually practicing is 75%.  For anything\nbeyond that, you'll just have to use the skill and let it improve naturally.\nYou begin with 5 {Gpractices{x and you receive from 1 to 5 more every time\nyou level.  The higher your {YWIS{x is when you level, the more {Gpractice{x\nsessions you receive.\n\n   Your character also has 5 primary {Yattributes{x that summarize his or her\nabilities.  They are: {Ystrength{x, {Ydexterity{x, {Yintelligence{x, \n{Ywisdom{x, {and {Yconstitution{x.  See the individual help files for each \nfor detailed information on how they affect your character.  {YAttributes{x\nstart at a specific value depending on what race and class you selected. To\nimprove your attributes, you use a {Gtraining{x session.  You begin with 3\n{Gtrains{x and after that, you receive 1 more every time you level.  Your\n{Yattributes{x range from 3 to 25, and usually start out between 10 and 15.\nYou will want to train your {YCON{x and {YWIS{x first.  This action also\nrequires a trainer.  There is one in the newbie school.  These trainers are\nnot always the same as the {Gpractice{x trainers.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut3'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 TUT3~\nMHS Newbie Tutorial Part 3\n\nLEVELS and RULES CHANGES\n \n   As your character levels up, some of the game rules will change.  Also,\nyou'll be gradually forced to explore more the game world.  At level 6, you\nwill nol onger be able to enter newbie school, and must locate trainers in \nthe world somewhere.  Your character does not have to worry about the size of\nhis/her armor until level 11, and is able to use the {Crecall{x skill at will\nuntil level 11 as well.  After that, recalling requires the use of deity gifts\n(see {chelp deity{x), spells, or magic items.  The game will warn you about \nthese changes as you approach level 11.\n\n   When you level, it is in your best interests to wear what is called\n\"levelling gear.\"  Anything can technically be \"levelling gear\", but this\nterm generally refers to equipment that people only wear when they are about\nto level.  Usually this equipment gives you bonuses to your {YCON{x, {YWIS{x,\nand {YINT{x (see the helpfiles for each attribute for more information).\nWhere do you find levelling gear?  Ask around and explore, that is your best\nbet.  Note that when you level, the amount of experience that you need to \nreach the next level doesn't change.  Rather, you begin to gradually get less\nexperience for the same monsters.  You'll need to explore and find new monsters\nto slaughter that are more of a challenge.\n\nTo continue this tutorial, type 'help tut4'.\nFor the index of Tutorial topics, type 'help tutindex'.\n~\n\n0 SPELLCRAFT~\n\n   Spellcraft is a special skill in which the spellcaster has studied\nthe metaphysics of spellcasting.  Those skilled with spellcraft are able\nto identify which spells other are casting, whether they are of the same class\nor not.  They also suffer a smaller mana drain when they loose concentration,\ncan sometimes cast a +1 over their normal casting level.  Spellcraft has a\nvariety of other, more subtle effects that make for a more solid \nspellcasting character.  This skill is incredibly difficult to increase.\n~\n\n0 BANKS BANKING DEPOSIT WITHDRAW~\nSyntax: deposit <#>\n        withdraw <#>\n\n   There is one banker in Midgaard, his name is Otho, he can be\nfound on clan road.  You may only deposit eggs into the bank, and they\nmust be in your inventory for you to do it.  Your total number of eggs\nin the bank is listed in your score.  You do not collect interest and \nthere is no minimum balance.  Your eggs are completely safe in the bank.\nNotice that unsavory individuals may hang around and attempt to steal your\neggs when you go to deposit/withdraw them.  The bank is not responsible \nfor stolen eggs.  \n\n~\n\n0 COLOR COLOUR~\n\n   Syntax based on Lope's standard colour code.\n\n   To enable color, type \"color on\".  To disable, type \"color off\".\n\n   This SLED automatically colorizes some elements of the game.  If you do\nnot like our colors, do not turn color on.  If you want to use only a few\nparts of color, get a client and utilize its color features.\n\n   You may use the following in any place to create color; notes, titles,\ntells, channel use, any where.  Please note that if you do not reset the\ncolor to 'normal', your color will bleed.  If you do this, you will be \nfrozen, so be very careful.\n\n    Red:    {{r for {rnormal{x, {{R for {Rbright{x\n    Blue:   {{b for {bnormal{x, {{B for {Bbright{x\n    Green:  {{g for {gnormal{x, {{G for {Gbright{x\n    Yellow: {{y for {ynormal{x, {{Y for {Ybright{x\n    Black:  {{D for {Dblack{x,  {{W for {Wwhite{x\n    Cyan:   {{c for {cnormal{x, {{C for {Cbright{x\n    Magenta:{{m for {mnormal{x, {{M for {Mbright{x\n    NORMAL: {{x resets colors to normal.\n     \n    Proper use of color:\n\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS{{x!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS{x!\n\n    Improper use:\n    <100/100hp> title will kick your {{RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp> whois me\n    [51 Human War] Me will kick your {RASS!!!\n    <100/100hp>\n    {x\n\n    Get it?  If not, don't use it, please.  We don't issue warnings for\n    stupidity.\n~\n\n\n0 TRADE TRADING MUDTRADER~\nMudTrader 1.1\n\nSyntax: trade <cmd> <arg1> |amount|\n\nCommand Summary\n> trade request <character>\t \t- Start a trade \n> trade accept <character>\t\t- Accept a request to trade\n> trade decline <character>\t\t- Decline a request to trade\n> trade clear\t\t\t\t- Clear the current trade\n> trade cancel\t\t\t\t- Abort current trade\n> trade add <item in inventory>\t\t- Add something to the trade\n> trade add <gold|silver> <amount>\t- Add money to the trade\n> trade remove <item in trade>\t\t- Remove an item from the trade\n> trade remove <gold|silver> <amount>   - Remove money from the trade\n> trade show\t\t\t\t- Display current trade\n> trade approve\t\t\t\t- Finalize trade\n\nMudTrader is a special program that lets the MUD software act as a\nthird-party agent between two players who want to trade something,\nor purchase something from each other.  When you are trading, the money\nand items are removed from your inventory and held in memory.  If you remove\nthe items/money from the trade, leave the room, or cancel/clear the trade,\nyou get them back.  If you approve the trade, they go over to the other\nperson and are no longer yours.  When you are happy with the trade, type\n\"trade approve\" to finalize it.  BOTH traders must type \"trade approve\"\nfor it to work.  If anybody changes the trade, by either adding to it or\nremoving stuff from it, both people must type \"trade approve\" again.\n~\n\n-1 WIZLIST~\n\n        ________      ===============================      ________\n      /+_+_+_+_+_\\    |    The Gods of Moosehead    |    /+_+_+_+_+_\\\n      \\__________/    ===============================    \\__________/\n        |::XXXX|                                           |XXXX::|\n        |X::XXX|              Creator / IMP                |:XXXX:|\n        |XX::XX|               -----------                 |::XXXX|\n\t|XXX::X|        Rusty, The Oxidizing Dragon        |X::XXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|            Benefactor / Coder             |:XXXX:|\n        |XXXX::|               -----------                 |XXX::X|\n        |X::XXX|       Boogums \"BooglyDude\" McDugal        |::XXXX|\n        |XXXX::|                                           |XXX::X|\n        |:XXXX:|                                           |XXXX::|\n/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\                           /<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\/<<>>\\\n\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/       Immortals           \\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\\<<>>/\n       |.  /\\ . |            ---------------              |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Alagaster                 | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |               BriarRose  - ADMIN        |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |               KallaLilly                |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|               Karag                     | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|               Kuno - ADMIN              | . /\\  .|\n       | .//\\.  |               Slodhian - ADMIN          | .//\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | .//\\ . |\n       | .//\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       |.  /\\.  |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       | . /\\  .|                                         | . /\\  .|\n       |.  /\\  .|                                         |.  /\\  .|\n       | . /\\.  |                                         | . /\\.  |\n       |.  /\\ . |                                         |.  /\\ . |\n       | .//\\  .|     Long live the memory of Mandrake    | .//\\  .|\n        \\. /\\  /         who left before his time.         \\. /\\  /\n         \\ /\\ /    [ IMMORTAL ] Grey Kellam : Mandrake      \\ /\\ /\n          \\/\\/                                               \\/\\/\n           \\/                                                 \\/\nArt by Blackstaff and Sara\n\nLast Updated By Boogums - 30NOV03\n~\n-1 HERO HEROES~\nThe list that follows is that of those who have attained the\nlevel of 52.

Here, anyone of level 52\nor higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the\nusual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;\nexamples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to\ncreation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,\nability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote\nplayers to immortality.\n\nSince immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)\na carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal\nbehavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without\nexplicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please\ndon't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or\nyou'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to\nthis file.\n\nThe duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,\nare topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are\nfraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)\n~\n\n-1 SOCIALS~\n \nThis is a complete list of socials for Moosehead SLED:\nCompiled originally by: Sara\naccuse       adjust      air          apologize     applaud     babble\nbark         bcatch      beckon       beer          bearhug     beg\nbird         bkiss       bleed        blink         blush       boast\nboggle       bonk        bounce       bow           brb         burp\ncackle       caress      charge       cheer         chuckle     clap\nclaw         collapse    comfort      comb          cough       cover\ncower        cringe      criticize    cry           cuddle      curse\ncurtsey      dance       daydream     drool         duck        embrace\nexplode      eyebrow     faint        fart          flare       flash\nflex         flinch      flip         flirt         flutter     fondle\nfrench       frown       fume         gasp          giggle      glare\ngoose        grimace     grin         groan         grope       grovel\ngrowl        grumble     hand         head          hiccup      highfive\nhop          howl        hug          hush          ignore      innocent\ninsane       judge       kiss         knee          laugh       lick\nlove         lust        massage      meditate      moan        moon\nmosh         mutter      nibble       nod           nudge       nuzzle\npant         passout     pat          peck          pie         pinch\npissed       plead       point        poke          ponder      pout\npray         propose     puke         punch         purr        ramble\nraspberry    rofl        roll         rub           ruffle      run\nscratch      scream      serenade     shake         shiver      shrug\nsigh         sing        slap         slobber       smile       smirk\nsnap         snarl       sneeze       snicker       sniff       snore\nsnort        snowball    snuggle      sob           spam        spank\nspit         squeal      squeeze      squirm        stare       stretch\nstrip        stroke      strut        sulk          swoon       tackle\ntease        thank       threaten     tickle        tip         tongue\ntwiddle      type        undress      view          wave        whine\nwhistle      wiggle      wince        wink          wonder      worry\nworship      yawn        yeehaw       yodel         rose\tlaces\ntank\t     starve\t aargh\t      homework\t    puff\tdiffer\nyae\t     lightbulb   voodoo       ogg\t    confused\tbeam\nbite\t     discodance  scuff        whap\t    lag\t\tchortle\nzerbert      twitch      roxbury\n \n~\n\n-1 MERC~\nThis sled is based on Merc 2.1, created by Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn.  \nMerc 2.1 is available as Merc_21.tar.gz from ftp.tcp.com and \nftp.math.okstate.edu.\nE-mail to 'merc-request@kpc.com' to join the merc mailing list.\n\nThanks to ...\n  ...

Their universal greed is the strongest bond between\nany of the existing clanners.\n  \nAvarice is a highly selective clan, who tends to keep its numbers\nlow.  The exclusivity is derived from the clan's lack of trust in\noutsiders, and a desire to have a large market that can be used\nin amassing great wealth in the name of the Avarice clan.\n   \nEntrance Requirements:\n -Must be level 20+\n -Must have the steal skill (above 75%)\n    \nAvarice's great power and wealth must be protected at all costs.  In order\nto ensure that only loyal members to the cause of Avarice are gulded, expect\ntests of your abilities and quests to prove your faithfulness if you\nchoose to join the ranks of Avarice.\n\nAvarice Charter (rules)\n    \n -You MAY attack anyone of a thief-based reclass (thief, rogue, assassin,\n  berzerker, monk)\n -You may NOT attack anyone who is not a thief-based reclass.\n  EXCEPTION:  You are allowed to attack to aid a clanmate who has\n    been attacked.  Note that this doesn't mean you can attack your\n    clanmate, but you may attack anyone who is attacking them.\n -You do NOT group with those outside of your clan EVER. \n -You do NOT help those outside of your clan for free.\n -Read those again.

He was travelling the land and noticed that\nthere was power in the magical arts that was far beyond his or any others'\ncomprehension. He decided from that day forth to unite all pure spellcasters\nso as to fully understand and improve upon the arts of magic. He and his\nfaithful followers travelled the lands of Boinga to search out all those that\nhad the pure blood of magic in their veins. Those who would not join him and\nhis brethren were made to pay with their lives.\n\nHere we are left but a few proud spellcasters who have survived the trials\nof time. Now we shall rise again amongst the ashes of our ancestors. In our\nplight to truly unite the purity of magic, we have been forced to divide\ninto three sects.\n\nThose who adorn the White Robes of Warlock show the purity of magic through\nkindness. Their role in our clan is to guide all young spellcasters to gain\nknowledge of the magical arts.\n\nThose who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.\n\nThose who adorn the Black Robes of Warlock use the darker side of magic to\npunish the renegades who chose not to follow the true path, and defend our\nclan against those who would wage war. \n\nOur goals of the unity of pure magic has made us a very diverse clan, and for\nall those interested you may speak with any member of our clan and they will\nput you in touch with our recruitment officers.\n\n\nEntrance Requirements:\n  \n* You must be a pure spellcaster\n  (mage, cleric, elementalist, druid, wizard, crusader)\n   \nWarlock Charter (rules)\n*  You may not group with any clanner who is a:\n   Mage, Cleric, Elementalist, Druid, Wizard, or Crusader\n   They abuse the art and are to be killed on site.\n\n*  You may group with / help any nonclanner.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 RONOH~\n.\"It is a time of ideals,\n of leaders, of followers,\n of love, of friendship,\n of life, of death...\n of Honor.\"\n\nWE are the new generation of Honor clansmen and women.

In the end,\nClan Honor's strength in numbers allowed for victory, but at a great cost\nin lives.  The evil were caught, drawn, quartered, and hung.  They remain\nthere even today, as a reminder of the folly in betrayal, and the swift hand\nof vengeance.\n \nCLAN Honor's ideals come from the very heart of it's members.

They were a peacefull kind, only wishing to keep their \nrace going, raising cattle, and growing crops.  But as outsiders came to \nthe lands of the Goblins and tried to take over their farmland, it became \nobvious they would need some kind of defense, an army of some sort to fend \noff the newcommers.  And so was formed the Legion.\n\nThe Legion has one reason for being, and that is to keep the Goblins alive.\nIf you are a Goblin, and want to stand up for yourself in this world of\nraces far bigger then the Goblins, then the Legion is the place for you.\nThe Legion does not wish to seek out battle, we just wish to defend ourselves.\nAny race can join the Legion, but only a Goblin can ever hope to become\nanything more then just a guardsman.\n\nIf you wish to join the Legion, to help the Goblin race survive, you must\ncontact one of the leaders, or a recruiter, in a note or when you meet one\non-line. You must be able to roleplay, because the Legion is a clan formed \naround roleplaying and it is imperitive that you can do so to join this clan. \nIf you are a non-goblin then you may have to prove yourself worthy of \nprotecting the Goblins, because it would be a horrible thing if we recruited \nthe weak for this task.\n\nLONG LIVE THE LEGION!\n~\n\n-1 ELCRIC~\nThe Clan Circle\n\n    \"As one I am weak, but as many we are strong.  We are the Keepers of\nMagic.  We are the Magi of Clan Circle, Never Ending and Ever Lasting.\"\n\n    Magic.  It is the lifeblood of the universe.  It is magic that drives\nus, and it is in magic that we find true power.  This is the founding belief\nof clan Circle.  Through magic, any problem can be solved, any obstacle over-\ncome.  The main goal of Circle is to encourage and foster the development\nand increased use of magic, through the use of our own magic, power, and\nstrength.\n\n    The members of Clan Circle reside in the Tower, a massive building in \nwhich we work our spells.  Members of Circle receive free spell-ups, enchants,\ncorpse retrievals, and all of the other benefits that one would expect from a\nclan.  Although all clan members are expected to be willing to help others,\nthe Mentors of Circle are dedicated to this task.  The Guardians of Circle \nare the clan's military force, ready to fight at a moment's notice, and\nwilling to sacrafice their lives in defense of our ideals, members, and magic.\n\n    Roleplaying is *not* required to join Circle.  The only roleplaying\nthat is asked of all members is that you keep your characters seperate, as per\nthe basic \"no multiplaying\" rule of MHS.  We do encourage members to roleplay\nand develop their characters, but we do not require it.  Tithing of income\nis also encouraged but not required.\n\nCircle Leadership and Law\n\n    Circle is overseen by the Conclave, a council of 7 leaders who are\nelected or appointed from the clan.  There are very few defined rules in \nCircle.  We are a clan, we are Magi, we are family.  All members of Circle\nare given as much personal freedom as possible, and in return, we expect \nthat all members take responsibility for their actions, words, and beliefs.\n\nJoining Circle\n\n    Any race or class can join Circle.  Although our specialty is magic,\nand we generally only actively recruit mages and clerics, warriors and thieves\nare welcome to apply for admission.\n\n    The is only one requirement to join Circle.  Mages and Clerics must\nhave at least 8 spell groups, and Warriors and Thieves must have at least 3.\nBecause dragons are very difficult and timely to advance, the draconian spells\nare considered a spell group for the purpose of meeting this requirement.\n\n    If you wish to join Circle, talk to a Recruiter.  Any Inner Circle\nor Outer Circle is also a Recruiter.  If no recruiter is available, then post\na note to Circle, informing us of your race, class, and current level.  All\napplicants will be given a thorough interview, and some will be asked to \ncomplete a quest.\n\n                                  - Clan Circle, Never Ending, Ever Lasting\n~\n\n-1 LONER~\nLoners are individualists, standing alone from any Clan, but subject\nto the same rules as clanners with respect to pkilling, pstealing,\nand transportation spells.  By definition, Loners have no common\nhall, no leaders, and no affiliation among each other, save what they\nagree upon for themselves.\n\nTo become a Loner simply issue the 'loner' command between levels 5\nand 20.  This command -cannot- be reversed under any circumstance.\nDo it carefully.\n~\n\n-1 ECNALAB~\nIn life there are those who take, those who give, those who lead and\nthose who follow.  Seldom are they one and the same, but this is the\nland of Boinga, the land where the beautiful princess Alia once\nstepped. She had a vision, a vision of a family where to lead and to\nfollow to give and to take were equally respected by all who were\npart of the family of BALANCE.\n\nIn the days when Alia walked among us we were happy, at peace and\nable to console ourselves that we were no-one's master and no-one's\nslave. But Alia left this realm and chaos ensued. We strived to\nbecome what she had taught us and when we achieved it she did walk\namong us again.  Dissention was rife and soon after her visitation\nBalance fell under internal turmoil and deceit; the few feeling\nthat they took precedence over the many...\n\nAnd so this continued until one day few were left. They decided\nto make their own way and live the teachings of Alia rather than\nfollow them, throwing scorn on the likes of Riders those who would\nhave sheep rather than friends.\n\nWith that Balance was reborn!\n\nBalance is a family of members, none being any more important than\nany other. We strive for total equality and are in a constant\nstate of war with Riders, who see some fit to be ranked far above\nothers.  To join Balance just speak to any full member and they\nwill give you an interview (or arrange one for later). A full member\nis one who has been in the clan for 6 levels (or 20 days at 51). This\nis so new members have time to learn the ways of Balance before \ncompleting entrance into our clan.\n\nThe Current Speaker of Balance is Rigger.\nThe speaker of Balance is the person who is elected to be the\nspokesperson to the outside world.\n~\n\n-1 ESIMED~\nChildren of Demise\n\n        Darkness swallows light, death extinguishes life, and hope is but a \nfoolish dream. All things must come to an end, and the Children of Demise\nfaithfully help the end come quicker. We willingly bear the burden of life,\nso we can help the unbelievers on into the everlasting darkness. To enter\nthe darkness serving the faith is the greatest priviledge. To crush all\nhope and happiness is one the many steps to our eventual success.\nI, Eiji, am the father of Demise. I have come forth from the shadows to bring\nthe words and wisdom of Demise. There is no stopping our tide. We shall \nprevail.\n\nClan Demise\n\n        Clan Demise consists of a cult with a inner hierarchy. You rank\nis based on your level, your acts in the name of Demise, and your Role-\nplaying. Clan Demise allows pking, pstealing, and other cruel activities.\nWe work together as a tight unit, planning carefully all ventures.\nIf thou wishest to join Demise, expect a serious questioning from members.\nThey tolerate no stupidity, foolhardiness, or insolence.\nROLE-PLAYING is a MUST.\n~\n\n-1 DEMISE~\nAbove, in the planes of the Deities lies one of true evil.  His power is fueled\nby destruction and vengeance that are channeled through the wrath of his \nglorious children!  We are the Children of Cthon!  Spawns of Hell, Delivers \nof Death, Vengeance and Chaos.  We are the elite army of the greatest \npower.  We bare the burden of life to crush all hope and extinguish all life, \nmaking Cthon ever so much stronger! \n\nThose within our ranks have the privilege of serving the greatest evil.  As such\nCthon himself grants the elite army with speed and aura of fear that makes \nour enemies cower in fear with our power!  Possessing so much power we \nharness it and war with every existing clan, loner and outcast.  No treaty or \nbond between clans is powerful enough to stop our storm,  for we come for \nyou?always. In the words of wisdom of Eiji, the father of Demise, \"There is no\nstopping our tide! We shall prevail!\"\n\nClan Demise\n\nTo enter Clan Demise is a feat in itself.  Do not come looking for us.  We \nwill come to you.  Show us your power by killing and looting.  Any attack \non you consider it a test.  You must also be a minimum of level 15, and  \neven then, when we feel you are ready you fill be asked to join and no \nsooner.\n\nClan Demise is a cult of inner hierarchy, in which your rank is on the basis\nof your level,  your acts in demise, and other cruel activities.  If you do not\nmaintain your power and skills you will be outcasted and hunted by your \nformer clan.  No stupidity, foolishness or insolence is allowed, and  \nrole-playing is a must.  \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You must have a Thug or Killer flag\n\nDemise Charter (rules)\n{YGROUPING{x or {YWORKING{x with anyone outside the clan is *expressly* \nforbidden!

Let us pray...\"\n\nThe words of the Almighty are spoken, and his children wake, and listen.\nThese children are known for their devotion to the Almighty, the one\ntrue God of Boinga. Teachers, Warriors, Healers, Sages, Young and old\nalike, they bind together under one holy creed. Seeking out the false\nfaiths and their unholy prophets, they continue steadfastly to cleanse\nthe lands of the evil that has spawned within the hearts of pagan\nmen.\n\nThese children of the Almighty, from all walks of life, are bound\nheart, mind, and soul to a common purpose, and a common name:\n\nZealot.\n\nThe faithful of the Almighty have but one purpose:  to annihilate the\nfalse faiths of the lands through any means necessary.\n\nNoone shall be considered neutral.  All will fall before the might of\nthe Almighty!\n\nEntrance Requirements:\nNone\n\nZealot Charter (rules)\nYou may not group with or work with any other clanners.  They all\nserve false gods.  You may work or group with nonclanners as \ntheir gods have already been conqured by the Almighty and they are\nonly humoring themselves.\n\n~\n-1 'ZEALOT RANKS'~\n----------------------------Ranking----------------------------\n\n/1 The Light of the Almighty. [*]\nThe members of the light are entrusted with the task of spreading\nthe teachings of the Almighty. They proclaim his holy glories to\nthe heathen nations, distribute holy scripture, heal and aid fellow\nbrethren in the congregation. They aid in the equipping and teaching\nof new recruits of the Almighty's Church. They may also aid in the\ncleansing of heathens or errant pledges, but this is not required.\nThey also aid the recruiters in bringing new recruits into the clan.\n\n/2 The Hand of the Almighty. [!]\nThe members of the hand concentrate their skills to the task of\neliminating false prophets and heathens. They seek out the heathen\nfilth and send their souls to the light via a bloodshed cleansing.\nThe creed: \"There is no forgiveness of sin without the shedding of\nblood.\" is very dear to them, and each has taken this crusade to\nheart. They also may aid in the gathering of new recruits, but this\nis not their main task.\n\n/3 The Crown of the Almighty. [^]\nThese members seek to enforce clan policy through intervention\nwhen the recruiters or the Anointed are unavailable. They report\ndirectly to the Anointed any violation that they witness within the\ncongregation, and are appointed only by the Anointed. Their prime\ntasks are the purging of false pledges, and to aid in collection of\nfunds of the clan.\n\nAll Ranks: Inquisitors.\nDue to vile forces of greed and lust, power struggles within the\nclan are all too frequent. The Inquisitors seek out those within\nthe clan whose faith in the Almighty and whose loyalty to the Anointed\nare weak or insubordinate. They report to the Grand Inquisitor or\ndirectly to the Anointed, who then deliberate on any action which\nmight be necessary to quell the disturbance. Who is an inquisitor?\nThat knowledge is only kept by the Grand Inquisitor and by the Anointed.\nAll inquisitors are chosen by the Grand Inquisitor or the Anointed. Any\ninquisitor who exposes his status can expect to have it revoked at best,\nor become an outcast at worst.\n\nRanks 1-3 are considered equal in all aspects, and shall be treated\nas such. No one rank is superior to the other, and should not become\nboastful over his brothers. Such boasting breeds intolerance and resentment,\nand is highly frowned upon.\n\n/4 The Preacher of Light, The Hand of Destruction, The Crowning Glory\nThe Holy Scribe, The Grand Inquisitor, Protectors of the Faith.\nThese select positions are hand picked by the Anointed, and given\nresponsibility of recruiting, as well as tending to their own\nbranch affairs. None possesses any rank above the other, and all report\ndirectly to the Anointed. These members also collect funds from the\nclan.\n\n/5 The Anointed of the Almighty.\nThese chosen children of the Almighty oversee all that happens within\nthe church of the Almighty. These people are said to be the direct\nvoice of the Almighty, and obediance of their decrees is required.\nThese people have complete control of the congregation, but may seek\nadvice on internal matters as they so choose.\n~\n\n\n\n-1 POSSE~\nA band of evil beings roamed the lands, spreading fear and chaos,\nkilling, looting, and bringing havoc to the world.  Within this band\nwere a few consumed with guilt, which could no longer bear the screams\nand death cries of the fallen.  Straying from their evil ways, they\nformed a Posse.\n\nThe Posse would no longer stand by and let criminals walk freely about\nthe world.  Thus, Posse attacks all KILLERS, THIEVES, THUGS, and\nRUFFIANS.  In doing so, Posse has made a few enemies along the way.\n\nPosse does not wage war upon any clan.  We strive to kill all KILLERS,\nTHIEVES, THUGS, and RUFFIANS, dealing swift justice where possible.\nTaking this into account, no member of Posse is to carry any of the \nabove flags, with the exception of the Ruffian flag.  We are of the\nunderstanding that sometimes excessive force is necessary, and also\nthat accidents _do_ happen.  Should other flags occur, each such incident\nwill be judged on its merits.  As a general rule, Thug flags are usually\nunacceptable at best and Killer and Thief flags are almost always an\noutcastable offense.  Exceptions can be made for bugs and extenuating\ncircumstances, again as the situation dictates.\n\nWe are not a group of individuals, we are a Clan family of sorts, in that\nwe help each other out whether it be pkilling, eq, grouping, spell-ups, \nor even just to sit and talk.  We do not group with those that carry\nflags, but will deal with them for goods if it is for the good of our\ngreater cause and they are deemed trustworthy enough to do so.\n\nPosse consists of those who are Good, Neutral, and Evil.  All races\nand classes are considered in joining, but we do not accept just anyone.\nPlayers are urged to talk to a recruiter at an early age/level as to\nnot invest too much time into a character who will be turned down.\nTeamwork is a _must_, as is clan/pkill experience.  Roleplaying is not\nrequired.\n\nSanctions will be handed out to those members of posse who have trouble\nfollowing the posse charter. These can be given by both /4s and /5s and\nwill generally last for the duration of your flag. However, if the /4 or /5\nyou ask to remove you sanction feels that you have not yet served your time\nthey will post a note to the clan stating why they feel that way and how\nlong they feel you should keep the sanctions. It will then be upto a /5 to\nremove the flag. Sanctions will be handed out as follows:\n\nRuffian - Skill, Store, Portal Room, Regen, Healer\nThug - Healer, Regen, Skill, Store, Portal Room, Hall for 1 week.\nKiller and Thief - Immediate outcast, no questions asked. \n\nEntrance Requirements:\n\n* You may not have a flag (see definition below).\n\nPosse Charter (rules)\n\n- any member of any clan that carries a flag (Killer, Thief, Thug or Ruffian),\n  is to be killed.\n- No member of Posse may carry any flag. Carrying a flag is grounds for \n  sanctions. The worse the flag the worse the sanctions.\n- Grouping with or helping any member of any clan with any flag is forbidden.\n~\n-1 SREDIR REDIR~\nAnd when He opened the seal there went out a horse that was red, and power was\ngiven unto him that sat thereon to take peace from the Earth, and that its\ninhabitants should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great\nsword...\n\nAnd behold there came forth an ashen horse, and he that sat upon him had a pair\nof balances in his hand; with a measure of wheat on one side and a mound of\ndust on the other.  And the power was given unto him to steal that which\nnourishes the body--and the spirit...\n\nAnd lo a black horse then appeared, and he that sat upon him bore a bow whose\narrows flew across the sky as an infectious cloud; and unto him the power to\ndisfigure and drain away the life of Man was given...\n\nAnd behold a pale horse arose; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell\nfollowed with him...\n\nAnd power was given unto them over the four parts of the Earth; to kill with\nthe Sword, and with Hunger, with Disease, and with Death...And lo there was a\ngreat earthquake; and the Sun became as black as sackcloth, and the Moon became\nas blood, and the Stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth...\n\nFor when the great day of His wrath has come...who shall be able to stand?\n\nMAKE WAY FOR THE APOCALYPSE...\n\n[Premise]\nWe are a lawful organization constrained by the inevitability of the End; we\nare but harbingers of the coming Apocalypse.  We do not seek out conflict or\ndestruction, nor do we believe in pkilling and pstealing with impunity.  Our\npurpose is not to bring about the End but rather to facilitate what inevitably\nmust, and will be.\n\nThose who wish to become minions of the Apocalypse must request an audience\nwith the proper Incarnation.\n\nWarriors should direct their requests for membership to WAR.\nThieves should direct their requests for membership to FAMINE.\nClerics should direct their requests for membership to PESTILENCE.\nMages should direct their requests for membership to DEATH.\n~\n\n-1 OUTCAST OUTCASTS~\nOutcasts are the few who have left or been driven from their clan.  They\nare, in essence, Loners who have already been in a clan at some point in\ntheir lives.  Although some Outcasts are voluntary, the following are\na few reasons for someone to be removed from a clan:\n\n-- Attacking a fellow clan member\n-- Stealing from a fellow clan member\n-- Acting in conflict with the ideals of your clan\n-- Failing a mutiny of clan leadership\n-- Receiving a DWEEB flag\n-- Spying for another Clan\n-- Causing Inner-Clan Dissention\n\nOnce someone has been Outcast, they may not rejoin another clan unless\na voucher is purchased, these cost 50eggs. \n\n~\n\n-1 DWEEB~\nDweebs are special flags given to those who have invoked the rage of the\ngods themselves.  A Dweeb is given no safe haven, as they are allowed to be\nattacked by all.  This is considered the worst punishment an immortal can\nbestow on a mortal, short of deletion.  The following are some reasons for\na Dweeb flag:\n\n-- Continually spamming the public channels.\n-- Continually harrassing particular players.\n-- Cheating, Exploiting Bugs, and Intentionally Crashing the Sled.\n-- Interfering with Non-Clan combat if a Clanner.\n-- Interfering with Clanned combat if a Non-Clanner.\n-- Acting like an ass in the extreme.\n-- Using CB lingo on public channels\n-- Using l33t speak on public channels\n   (You don't look cool, you look like an idiot.  Real hackers don't use\n    it.  Quit watching TechTV.)\n\nNote that for MOST of the above offenses, you will be given warnings\nbefore you are Dweebed.  Those who have a Dweeb flag are considered to\nhave done something truly horrendous.\n\nAlso, if you find yourself Dweebed, the immortals will let you know the\nperiod of time you will keep the Dweeb flag.  It is a punishment, and you\nmust live with it.\n~\n\n-1 MATOOK~\nHelp 'Matook'\nMatook is an organized group of characters that have shown interest\nin dedicating their time to helping out other individuals as they\ncan.  This can involve spell ups, retrieving equipment, corpse\nretrievals, enchantments, and other miscellaneous  tasks that the\nindividual is willing to do.\n\nThe helpers of Matook gathered together and created a Grand Church\nin the North-Western Corner of Midgaard. Here in the Church many\nhelpful souls can be found, as well they have provided fast healing\nand mana recouperation rooms for the needy.\n\nIf you believe in yourself to follow the ways of Matook and wish to\njoin their order be prepared to give an example of your skill and\nknowledge of Boinga.  You will be directed to speak with a member of\nthe Council who will bestow a quest upon you. Any Matooker will be\nwilling to answer any further questions about the the Church in\ngeneral and please don't be shy to ask for some assistance in any\narea. Of course, since Matookers are non-clanners, clan interference\nis always forbidden.\n\n\"One cannot love with anger and hate for fear will always ruin one's\nfate...To live a life full of peace one must love or see it decrease.\"\n\n-May Matook Protect You.\n\n~\n\n-1 DONATION DONATIONS~\n\nThe DIKU liscence states that I can not take any money from anyone \nplaying MHS.

This character has\nnot yet been refreshed. If you 'continue' you will go through parts of the\ncreation process allowing you to change parts of your character to better\nbalance you within the game. If you 'quit' this character remains unrefreshed\nand you can do it at another time.\n\nYou can test pfreshing a character by logging into the OLC Port instead of\nhere with this character. Login to sled.moosehead.com port 8080. Once you\npfresh a character on port 4000 you can not undo or retry it.\n\nIf you have any questions as to what this process involves we recommend\n'quit' and create a new character and read 'help pfresh' once you are in\nthe game and ask questions of the other players and Immortals.\n~\n\n52 JOBS~\nAs an Immortal on MHS, there are certain things expected of you, and\nespecially as a newer immortal, you should be mindful of exactly what\nit is you're supposed to be doing.  Below is a short summary of what's\nexpected of an Immortal at each of the 7 levels.\n\nNote:  Not fulfilling the expectations of your job can result in demotion.\n\nAll levels:  Ensure that the rules are being followed.  If someone is\ncheating, either snap them back in line yourself, or ask for the aid of\na higher level Immortal.  You must be completely neutral in all dealings\nwith mortals, meaning you must treat your friends exactly the same as\nyou would your enemies.  Personal feelings have no place in the job of\nan Immortal.\n\n52 - Retired.  This is the level where immortals who have become inactive\nor have voluntarily retired are placed.  There are no real expectations,\nsave to follow the same rules as everyone else.\n\n53 - Trial IMM.  This is the first level you will be placed at as an\nImmortal.  At this level, your future IMMhood is dependant upon how\nyou act during this time.  Sometimes, Immortals don't work out, and if\nyou are found to be one of the ones who isn't working out, you'll be\nplaced at 52.  Expectations at this level are minor:  help enforce the\nrules, run a few minor quests, but most importantly, learn the lay of the\nland, the limited commands available to you at this time, the rules of\nbeing an Immortal, and begin statting mobs to get an idea of how mob\nstrength is balanced against level.  At this level, you should be asking\nquestions often, and seeking input to the majority of your decisions.\n\n55 - Newbie IMM.  At this level, you have a few more commands available\nto you, most notably string.  You've pass the majority of the 'trial'\nstage, but you're still expected to be learning.  This is the first level\nwhere you will have access to On-Line Construction (OLC), and you'll be\ngiven a small set of vnums to practice your building skills.  Expectations\nat this level:  help enforce the rules, handle restrings for players, learn\nOLC, continue learning the balances of mob and item strength vs. level.\nYou have a bit more free reign when it comes to making decisions, but any\nmajor decision should still be brought forward to a more experienced\nImmortal.\n\n57 - Immortal.  At this level, you are no longer considered a 'newbie' to\nImmortalhood, and you have the majority of the commands in the game used\nto penalize other players and handle day-to-day situations.  By now, you\nshould have a firm grasp of the rules of MHS and the rules of IMMhood,\nand a working relationship with the rest of the IMMteam.  Expectations at\nthis level are:  be active, enforce the rules, run quests, handle strings,\nbuild on OLC, and deal with any other day-to-day situations that may arise.\nYour conduct may still be up for review if you're found to be lacking, but\nyou're no longer at risk for being cut from the team for not 'fitting in'\nonce you've reached this point.\n\n58 - Senior Immortal.  Immortals who've proven that they have a solid grasp\nof the way MHS and the IMMteam works, and the maturity to handle almost any\nsituation with a cool, neutral demeanor may find themselves promoted to\nSenior Immortal.  The job expectations don't change, but you are given some\nof the more sensitive commands on MHS with which to work.  Not all\nImmortals will make it this far, and the ones that do should be respected\nfor their dedication to MHS.\n\n59 - Admin.  Admins supervise the lower level Immortals, while still \nkeeping up all of the expectations of all the other jobs.  They have\ntheir hands full of responsibility, and almost every command available\non MHS, including reboot and permban.  If, as a lower level Immortal,\nyou have a question as to a rule, either for mortals or for Immortals,\nor you need feedback on an idea that you've had but you aren't sure\nabout, speak to an Admin.  They've been around long enough to know MHS\ninside and out, and can answer any question you have for them.  Some Admins\nare also Coders, and have the additional responsibility of writing new\ncode for the game, and eradicating bugs from existing code.\n\n60 - Implementor.  If you need to be told what your job as an Implementor\nis, you should probably put down the crack pipe now...\n\n~\n\n-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~\nYou may kill other players once you join a Clan or Loner.  If they are \nmore than 8* levels below you, you can't do it.  If your intended victim\nis not in a Clan, again you can't touch them (unless they have a THIEF \nor DWEEB flag). You may steal from other players if they are not more \nthan 7* levels below your level, and in a Clan. For either of the above \nactions you will recieve a flag and may have trouble with guards in town.  \nAlso other players may get to attack you.\n\nThere are specific ways to get certain flags:\n(Tf) A thief flag is gotten for failing an attempt at stealing from a \n     player.  You may be attacked by anyone up to 12 levels above you\n     when you have this flag.  It can only be lost by dying to another\n     player while you have no other flags.\n(R)  A ruffian flag is gotten from initiating combat on an unflagged \n     player. This flag has no consequence except saving someone who \n     attacks you from receiving a flag.  This flag is lost by dying to \n     another player.\n(Th) A thug flag is received if you actually kill a player. This \n     enables people up to 10 levels above you to attack you .  This \n     flag is lost by dying to a player either 1 or 2 times depending \n     on the number of players killed as a thug.\n(K)  A killer flag is earned by killing 3 players without dying in \n     between. The consequence is that {YANYONE{x may attack you. \n     The flag is lowered to a thug flag upon death at the hands of \n     another player.  When attacking somebody who origionally isn't \n     able to attack you, that person gains the right to attack you \n     until they have killed you.\n\nIs it worth it?  You decide.\n\n~\n\n52 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~\n.\n                         **********************\n                         ** The Rules of MHS **\n                         **********************\n \n1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.\n    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.\n \n2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. \n    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,\n    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    \n    and softening up or altering mobs.\n \n3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.\n    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly\n    go there themselves.\n \n4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.\n \n5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.\n \n6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie\n    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items\n    isn't.\n \n7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT \n    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some \n    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels\n    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).\n \n8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you \n    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore\n    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.\n \n9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  \n \n10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal\n    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.\n\n11) Do not argue with level 59 or 60 IMM's.  You're wrong, just admit it!\n~\n-1 PUFF~\nNo plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --\nHe grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.\nCompiles and simulations grew so quickly tame\nAnd swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.\nCHORUS:\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\n        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,\n        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.\nPuff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails\nAnd mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.\nAll the student hackers loved that fractal Puff\nBut DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, \"Enough!\"\n                (chorus)\nPuff used more resources than DCS could spare.\nThe operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.\nA gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,\nBut Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!\n                (chorus)\n~\n\n-1 CLIST~\nThis is a list of currently active clans on MHS.  For more details,\nsee the clan's helpfile \"help <clan name>\"\n\nHonor: A group of noble warriors, united in a common cause against\n       the evils of Boinga.\n\nDemise: A clan of bloodthirsty killers, solely intent upon the\n        destruction of good.\n\nWarlock: A clan of spellcasters, devoted to the preservation and\n         purity of magic.\n\nZealot: A group of religious fanatics, intent on preaching the word\n        of their God, and converting nonbelievers by any means\n        necessary.\n\nPosse: A militia who charge themselves with the eradication of\n       lawbreakers.\n\nLoner: Not members of a true clan, these warriors venture forth\n       into the dangerous lands of Boinga, with nobody to rely\n       on but themselves.\n\nOutcast: Once members of a clan, they have either left their old\n         life behind, or been banished forever for bring harm\n         upon their former brethen.\n\nSee the appropriate clan helpfile for more information, or speak with\na clan leader or recruiter (denoted by a rank of /5 or /4, respectively)\n~\n\n-1 RULES~\nThese are the rules of MHS.  For other matters, use common sense.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at ANY God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be\n  tolerated.\n\n* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods\n  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.\n  Please MAIL these bugs to: cascadia@nventure.com\n\n* Seerated player stealing or player killing.  Clanned players will NOT\n  involve non-clanned players in player killing in any way.  Non-Clanned\n  players will NOT intentionally involve themselves in player killing.\n  This includes spelling up clanners so they can go pkilling, or who are\n  being pkilled themsleves.  Nonclanners also cannot stand near pfights\n  and take disarmed weapons or fallen stones.\n\n* Summoning mobs and sleeping them at other aggresive mobs is forbidden.\n  If you summon Papa to the Dees and sleep Papa, and a nonclanner or \n  clanner gates to Papa, expect to be punished.  If you want to use Papa\n  or any other mob as a gate post, do not sleep them in a room with other\n  mobs, you may or may not know they are aggressive. \n\n  *NOTE* This does not mean summoning low level clanners to the Dees or\n  any Aggie is now illegal, however summoning any nonclanner to an aggie\n  without their permission still is illegal.\n\n* Sitting around idle with a client is not permitted.\n  This includes using a script away from your terminal.\n  If you are found idling with a client, you will be penalized.\n  If you are using a client you -must- be at the keyboard, and you\n  -must- be paying attention to the MUD.  You may use clients to ease your\n  typing woes, not play your character for you.\n\n* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with \n  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.  If you have two characters, \n  in essence, one does not know the other.  A character belongs to only 1 \n  person and can never be transfered, shared or given to anyone else under \n  any circumstances.  If the Immortals think you are multiplaying, you are \n  guilty until proven innocent.  This is not easy to do, please keep that \n  in mind.  This includes transferral of gear from character to another,\n  and using the influence of your characters to gain access to special\n  privileges. \n  This also includes the revealing of alternate characters.  If you know\n  who someone's \"alt\" is, you are not to reveal that at all.  Not over\n  public channels, not in notes, or says or tells.  Your characters are\n  seperate.\n\n* Do not log off one character and quickly log in another character. Wait\n  atleast 2 minutes between switching, regardless if it switching between\n  nonclanner and clanner or any combination of the two. If you do not wait\n  atleast 2 minutes expect to be watched and penalized for any wrong doings.\n\n* Any equipment found laying on the ground is completely fair game.\n  -> Exception: non-clanners may NOT pick up disarmed weapons from clanners.\n  -> Exception: vice versa of the above exception.\n  -> Exception: stones and floaters fall into this category, too\n\n (Note: Heat Metalled EQ is the same as disarmed, if you know the EQ is from\n  a pfight then dont take it.)\n\n* Under no circumstance may a clanner loot a non-clanner's corpse, unless\n  the non-clanner requests it.  At this point, anything the clanner does with\n  the looted gear is his/her own prerogative, and the non-clanner has left the\n  the fate of that equipment in the hands of the clanner.\n\n* Softening creatures for lower levels is now expressly forbidden and\n  cheating.  Don't be surprised if an IMM reprimands or punishes you for \n  it.  This includes maladicting/damaging mobs and fleeing.  If you are\n  grouped with someone it is acceptable to flee, however please note that\n  sometimes they will receive less experience then if you had stayed. To\n  re-iterate, this still means its illegal for a level 51 to knock a mob\n  down to awful then allow a level 30 to kill it. If you can't group with\n  them do not help them level.\n\n* Telling IMMS who deserves a dweeb will result in one being applied to\n  yourself; leave IMMs to their job.\n\n* Channel \"spamming\" and personal attacks on someone over public channels\n  are not allowed.  This can result in having no public channel access to\n  denial of your character, depending on severity and intent.  No excuse\n  or reason is required to remove channels.  If you are being irritating,\n  you'll loose channels, though generally not for a very long time.\n\n* Excessive use of capital letters is extremely irritating, and highly\n  frowned upon.  It's the internet equivalent of shouting, so if you\n  insist on using massive amounts of capital letters, don't be surprised\n  if you find yourself with a warning, or without your channels.\n\n* Your equipment is your equipment.  Keep it with you.  You may not leave\n  your special/rare/enchanted gear or money behind in a safe place while\n  you go pkilling.  If you're going to involve yourself in a pkill \n  situation, are are being forcibly involved in wear, KEEP YOUR EQUIPMENT\n  WITH YOU.  You also may not steal or beguile if you have no equipment.\n  Casting of eq damaging spells such as, but not limitted to, heat metal\n  acid breath, rust wepaon, rust armor etc. is also illegal with less\n  than 10 pieces of gear suitable for your level equipped.\n\n  (Keep ATLEAST 10 items equiped when PKilling/Stealing/Infiltrating)\n  (Charming and Entrancing are both considered Pkilling/Stealing as well)\n  (These 10 pieces must be for characters of your level.  You may not go\n   get equipment off cityguards with your 51 mage and then go sleep people).\n \n* Clans may not have a Treasure or Storage Character. No Character is to be\n  used to remain in the Hall and hold any items. It is also illegal to have\n  Non Clanners hold things for Clanners they do not wish to lose due to \n  Pkilling/Pstealing. Any character found to be a Treasure or Storage\n  character shall be denied.\n\n* You may not attack nor cast any spells with the intent of waking a fellow\n  Clan Mate due to a pkilling situation. Attacking a fellow clan mate is \n  always grounds for Outcast and in this case a DWEEB.\n\n* Other rules for clanned players are found in \"Help Clan\"\n\n* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and\n  you will be fine.  DELETION does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent\n  to Boogums (cascadia@nventure.com) \n\n* Incessant complaining about penalties will generally result in said penalty\n  being extended.  If you'd like to form a reasonable and mature case for\n  your own defense, that's fine.  Whining will be ignored at best, and could\n  increase the duration of your penalties.\n\n* Please respect the time and effort that have gone into Moosehead SLED.\n  The IMMs who work here do so voluntarily.  Do not advertise other MUDs\n  on our channels or notes.  Player privacy is -generaly- respected when\n  it comes to private tells, but we ask that you do not use MHS as a base\n  for recruiting players or staffers for other MUDs.  There are sites on\n  the web that have posting boards for such thins, such as:\n  http://www.mudconnector.com/\n\n* Repeat offenders are dealt with more harshly, even if not for the same\n  offense.  Everything is stated clearly in this helpfile, don't break \n  these rules.\n\n* If you are penalized for cheating, the penalty is a sanction against you\n  the player, not necessarily just your invididual character.  This means\n  that if one of your characters is penalized for something and you log in\n  a different, unpenalized character, you don't get a blank slate.  Your\n  penalty record belongs to you the person at the keyboard, sanctions are\n  applied against whichever of your characters violated the rules.\n\n* Bounties are intended as a fun option for players, but there is potential\n  for abuse.  For example, you could arrange for a friend to kill him so \n  the friend collects the gold donated by your enemies.  This kind of thing\n  is watched, and if you are suspected of making such an arrangement, or\n  engaging in any other abuse of the bounty system, you and your cohorts\n  will be slain and your corpse eaten.  Details of bounties and collections\n  are logged and will be watched.\n\n* Anything not covered here is at any God/IMMs discretion.  Obey them and\n  take them at their word.  Whining and/or rules lawyering will NOT be \n  tolerated.\n\n* Remember, this game is brought to you for FREE.  You have no rights nor \n  do the PEOPLE who run the game owe you anything.\n\n~\n\n0 SUICIDE DELETE~\nUse the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be\navailable for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,\nand you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will\nreturn your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the\nfirst delete.\n~\n \n0 HEALER~\nThe healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some\nservices are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see\na full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To\nreceive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.\n~ \n\n\n-1 GAIN~\nThe gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has \nbeen found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:\n\ngain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned\ngain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost\ngain apply :  turns 10 skill points into one practice \n\nGain uses practices to gain new skills, spell groups, and kits.\nGained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total\nnumber of creation points. \n~\n\n52 CLONE~\nSyntax:\n  clone obj <object>\n  clone mob <mobile>\n  clone <name>\n\nThe clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile\nthat may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in\nthe same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is\npreserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or\nmobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  \nStrung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.\n~\n\n\n0 SKILLS SPELLS~\nThe skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list\nof available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in\norder of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)\nlisted where applicable.\n~\n0 'SKILL POINTS'~\nSkill Points are rewarded to you for using your various skills in a \ncombat situation.  You cannot \"spam up\" a skill and get skill points.\nYou need to actually get out and do stuff.\n\nThey may be converted with the 'gain apply' command at the appropriate\nguildmasters into practices.\n~\n\n0 OUTFIT~\nThe outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with\na new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), \ncourtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.\n~\n\n0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT FULLSAC~\nMHS uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting\ngold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:\n\nautolist  : list all automatic actions\nautoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles\nautogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles\nautosac\t  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)\nautoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room\nautosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members\nautoassit : makes you help group members in combat\nfullsac   : able to sacrifice containers with items inside\n\nTyping a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. \n~ \n-1 CLAN CLANS~\nThroughout Boinga, there exist groups of people united through a common\ncause.  These clans have been formed for a purpose, whether it be the\nspread of goodness, the accumulation of money, or just to maintain the peace.\n\nIn order to join a clan, you must contact a clan leader or recruiter,\neither by tells or via a note.  Leaders will have a /5 beside the name\nof their clan.  Recruiters are usually, but not always found with a /4\nbeside the name of their clan.  The requirements to join ANY clan are as\nfollows:\n\nYou must be between the levels of 5 and 20 or a Loner or an Outcast\nof any level.  After you have exceeded level 20, and have not either\njoined a clan or become a Loner, you can never join the pkill system.\n\nOnce you have joined a clan, you are making a committment to a cause.  If\nfor some reason you wish to switch clans, you may do so.  However, you\nmust first OUTCAST yourself from your old clan.  After outcasting you must\npurchase a voucher (not a cheap item) to gain access into a new clan. \nAlso, be wary, for those who make frequent changes in their clan find \nthemselves clanless quickly.\n\nExpect to be full looted. Some clans out there are destined to make your\nlife miserable. Accept it and go on with the game, however with that said\nthere must be an appeal to your humanity. Understand how full looting some\none makes them feel. Yes you've had it done to you, yes its a part of\nthe game. Do you really want to have a hand in driving off the player base?\nFind better ways to enjoy the game, help people stay and play.

Here is how it works.  Each clan hall area and \nbranch hall area should have/get a copy of the existing guard mob.\nhte only difference is, you remove the sentinal flag from the mob.\nyou also need to add the stay_area flag as well.  The name of the \nmob should be changed to 'roaming blah blah blah' so for Demise it\nwoudl be 'roaming guard of cthon' or something like that.  that way\nwe can find them easily.  For roamers in the branch halls, use the \nbranch hall area.  Let's try an minimize cross vnumming.  Post\nup any questions to me.\n\nGuard HPS\nLevel\tAmount\n40-42     15d10+4000\n43-45     25d10+5000\n46-48     25d10+6500\n49-51     50d10+8000\n52        50d10+11000\nGuards cannot be above level 52.

You may pay for \ntraining for your entire guard corps.  This training includes \nall guards on staff at your branch hall. Should decide to hire more \nguards, they will have the same level of training and ability \nas your existing corps.   Prices for training your guards or \nhiring new guards are found in the {YPRICES{x helpfile.\n\nClan leaders are responsible for the descriptions of the equipment, \nhowever stats and affects of the equipment has been predetermined \nand will be the same for all clans.  This is not negotiable or \nupgrade-able.  \n\nYou may have a maximum of 2 guards per room.\n\nA Guard Eq set consists of a helmet, a shield, gloves, a torso item,\nand boots.  \n\nBranch offices will be open to all clanners, that is\nwhy you have a guard, who will sound the alarm should an\nenemy invade your branch hall.\n\nYou will be provided one (1) one way door into your branch\nclan hall from the portal room of your Main hall.  To return \nto your main hall, you will have to use your traditional \nmeans of transportation.  The branch halls are nowhere, \nmeaning people scanning from outside your hall cannot see you. \nHowever, you will not be able to use scan from inside your \nbranch hall.  You will have to go outside. The entrance to \nyour branch hall is a secret entrance.    \n\nClan leaders can purchase upgrades and additions for their \nbranch hall, but remember, all clanners can get into your \nalls and have access to anything in there, so build wisely.\nPrices for additions to your branch halls are the same as\nthose in the \"help prices\" file.  Branch halls may not have \nportals or obs rooms.  Branch halls may not have locking doors, \nprivate rooms, owner only, or clan specific only rooms.  \nEvery room in a branch hall will be open to all clanners.\n\nPortals are NO LONGER AVAILABLE you may put a branch hall in an area of your\nchoosing.\n\nImmortals:\nSee the help BHALLS file for vnums.\n~\n0 DOT 'DAMAGE OVER TIME'~\n\nDamage Over Time (also called DOT) affects are special types of spell affects.\nA DOT affect doesn't cycle with normal spell affects, it has its own timer\nand is not looked at during normal ticks.  DOTs use a special, faster tick\nthat kicks in every 10 seconds.  When this tick hits, the DOT runs its course,\ndoing damage to the victim.  Some DOT spells also do direct damage up front, but\nthis isn't a requirement of a DOT affect.  Most DOTs have no cure, but do low\namounts of damage, so low they often fall under the damage curve.  But for this\nvery reason, DOTs are also quite powerful, as they can do hundreds of points of\ndamage and none of it gets curved.  The cost is time, as a victim of a DOT can\nuse several tactics to reduce the effectiveness.  Most DOTs last 1-2 minutes \nand do gradually less damage as they go.  Many things affect how much damage\na DOT does, and none of those secrets will be divulged here.\n\nThe Shaman kit is the best in the game, having access to an elite corp of DOT\nspells in the 'disease' group.  No DOT can rival the power of these spells.\nOther, more mundane DOT spells exist.\n\n~\n0 $~\n\n#$\n","position":146062},"values":[]}]

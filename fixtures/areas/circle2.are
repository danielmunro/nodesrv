The dream to prove that\nMagicks are more powerful than mere weapons and armor.  This man,\nArkisbane, was joined by other mages of his day. Together they sought to\nincrease the influence of magic in the land of Boinga.  To further this\ngoal they aligned themselves as a clan and purchased a place of refuge and\ncontemplation.\n \nIn the year when the great storm passed over the land, Arkisbane was\ncalled away to other lands.  He passed leadership of this new clan to one\nwhom he deemed worthy.  A time of growth and prosperity ensued.  Circle was\nquickly accepted in the land and all began to look to them as wise men and\nwomen. Then one day this leader was called away to other adventures.\n \nA period of darkness consumed Circle.  They floated for a time\n...without guidance.  Until one day a light renewed itself, and rose up out\nof the darkness to bring a new life to the Unending path of the Circle.\nMythorn had a vision.  A new way to govern a clan.  Not by rule of one man\nor woman, subject to his or her whims, but rule by a group, a council of\nthose who had long traveled the Path of the Magicks.  He prayed to the gods\nand it was ordained that there shall be four members in this 'innermost'\ngroup of Circle.  For by having four leaders Circle would never again be\nwithout a ruler.  Thus was born the tradition of the Inner Circle.\n \nThis first Inner Circle was short lived.  Two of the chosen four left\nthe realms of mortality and clanhood in search of the greater Magicks of\nimmortality. Four moons passed while Circle was once again ruled by one\nman, a man who was a capable and kind leader.  One who still had a dream of\na clan ruled by a group.\n \nAfter the fourth moon grew dim, Mythorn dreamt.  In his dream were\npresented to him the names of those who should next guide Circle.  Inner\nCircle once again rose into being.  This time cautions were taken to ensure\nthat there would always be leaders if one or more of the Inner Circle were\ncalled away.  Thus began the Outer Circle. Not officially leaders, but\ndesignated protectors and advisors for younger members.  Circle once again\nbegan to prosper as a clan.  Their ranks grew large and they became a\nfearsome force in the land of Boinga.  But still their main purpose was the\nstudy and teaching of Magicks.\n \nIn the year of the great gold dragon, a shadow passed across Circle.\nSome members sold themselves to the dark side and tried to turn the entire\nclan to the ways of evil.  But with the guidance of Mojo they were put in\ntheir places, and Circle was once again covered by a holy aura of\nprotection. During this time of upheaval many wise persons were lost to\nthe dark side.  Unfortunately none of them could be converted back, and\nthey were forever banished from the brotherhood.  Another brief period of\ndisarray ensued while new leaders were chosen to replace those who had\nleft. But this disarray was short lived, and when new leaders were voted\nupon, the doors were once again open for Circle to lead the way in search\nof ever greater and more powerful knowledge.\n \nMay the past serve to guide us in our future.\n-Recorded this Day of Ascension in the Year of the Coming.\n-With many thinks to the elders for their patient retelling of\nthe past to this humble servant.\n~\n#4433\ncircle guardian bracer~\na Circle Guardian bracer~\nThe bracer of a Circle Guardian lies here.~\ncopper~\njewelry G AM\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 10 550 P\nA\n5 1\n#4434\nmagus necklace~\na magus power necklace~\nA magus necklace lies here.~\nenergy~\njewelry G AC\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 20 550 P\nA\n12 10\nA\n5 1\n#4435\nchain lost soul~\nthe chain of the lost soul~\nA heavy steel chain lies here.~\nsteel~\nweapon 0 AN\nflail 3 7 crush I\n20 30 2800 P\nA\n19 3\nF\nA 0 0 I\n#4436\npromise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry F AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nA\n4 2\nA\n13 -20\n#4437\nstar chart~\nthe star chart~\n~\npaper~\nportal ORY P\n0 0 0 4440 0\n0 0 0 P\n#4438\nstar Anteres~\nAnteres~\nA large star lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor A AD\n1 1 1 0 0\n2 100 5000 P\nA\n1 1\nA\n5 1\n#4439\nevent horizon~\nan event horizon~\nTorn from the fabric of time and space, an event horizon lies here.~\nnothing~\ngem A AQ\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n13 10\n#4440\norion belt~\nOrion's Belt~\nA belt lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor AB AL\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n3 1\nA\n4 1\n#4441\nsentinel axe~\nThe Sentinel's Axe~\nAn axe lies here.~\nnothing~\nweapon C AN\nexotic 0 0 none 0\n22 20 0 P\n#4442\nancient promise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry EFHMd AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 MW\nA\n13 -20\nA\n4 2\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#4400\nThe Foyer~\nYou stand in the Tower of Clan Circle.

Chamber.  \nThe room is very dark and you can almost see the power eminating from the\nvarious portals that lead to unknown regions.  Against the back wall are\nseveral black gates, whose surfaces twist and churn with magical energy,\nlooking like a whirlpool of black waters.\n \nA large metalic plaque beckons for you to read it.\n~\n0 D 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nE\nmirror~\nThe mirror is aproximately 7 feet high and 5 feet wide.  The frame is\nmade of a hard metal, which harbors the most intricate designs you\nhave ever set eyes upon.  Huge snake like dragons are carved into\nthe frame, circling dozens of hour glasses.  The glass itself is\nsmooth and untarnished.  Peering into the reflective surface, you\ncome to realise that shadowy figures seem to be staring back at you\nfrom the other side of the glass.  \n~\nE\nmetalic plaque~\nThe plaque reads as follows:\n \n     Welcome to Circle's portal chamber.  This chamber calls forth on\n     great magical energies that have been put into the stone by the\n     old masters of magic.  A large mirror is used to create rifts\n     in time, which allows us to open gateways to other dimensions.\n     This in turn lets us travel from one place to another in very\n     little time.  The use of this wonderous magical relic is quite\n     simple.  Simply enter the portal while thinking of your desired\n     destination.\n      Example:     enter drow\n \nDimensional rifts currently accesible are: \n - Drow City        (enter drow)\n - Sand of Sorrow   (enter sands, enter sorrow)\n - Great Pyramid    (enter pyramid)\n - Elemental Canyon (enter canyon)\n - Old Thalos       (enter old, enter thalos)\n - Haon Dor Forest  (enter haon)\n~\nS\n#4410\nThe Herb Garden~\nThe south end of the Tower has been removed, and growing in the open air\nand sunshine is a garden of herbs.  A cobblestone path through the garden,\namong the well-trimmed hedges and carefully-tended flowers and plants.  There\nis no gardener in sight, perhaps these plants live off of the magic of the\nclan.

A soft layer of grass\ngrows magically out of floor, and a quiant, wooden gazebo with a comfortable\nswinging bench is located in the grass.

The wind at this height is strong, and \nthe altitude is somewhat dizzying, but the railings are secure, and the view\nis magnificent.  The spires of the hall reach towards the sky from just over\nyour head, and looking directly down, you can see the open courtyard on the\nthird floor, and the gazebo and herb garden on the second floor.\n~\n0 0 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4436\nS\n#4413\nThe Practice Room~\nTucked away in a unused wing of the Tower, the practice room is a safe place\nfor mages to apply their studies to experience.  The room is dark, and smells\nlike sulfur, probably a leftover from so many endless hours of fireballs and\nmagic missiles being hurled through the air.  Near the door to the room is\na small sign, with some admonishments for the would-be practicer.  \"Thou shalt\nnot practice thy combat spells on thy clanmates.\"  \"Thou canst kill thyself \nwith thine own magic missile.\"  \"If thou shoudst sleep thyself by accident, \nask not for help from thy clanmates, but certainly shouldst thou expect to be \nmercilessly teased for thine idiocy.\"  Mages always were a rather sarcastic \nbunch.\n~\n0 D 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4424\nS\n#4414\nThe Dungeons~\nNewly added after the tower was completed, the dungeons are not really all  \nthat bad.  Comfortable straw mattresses with cloth sheets and woolen blankets\nare shoved against the far wall, and magical barriers replace steel bars.  It\nappears that the dungeons were added as an afterthought, and have probably \nnever yet been used.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nD5\nExit ~\ngrate~\n16455 0 4439\nS\n#4415\nThe Alchemist's Lab~\nWhoever hired the alchemist to work for the clan is long gone, but Circle's\nmad scientist is still here, brewing potions and running a side operation in\ntangent with Wilf's Diner.

To \none side of the room lies a communal chest of donated items.

A small fire burns to heat the room when it is cold.\nThe walls are a soft white and glow with a pale radiance.  Champagne,\nale and various pre-mixed drinks are sitting on the bar's\ncounter.  Delicate foods are arranged on intricately designed chinaware.\nThe small curtained window looks out into the garden.  Through the window,\nin the far corner of the garden, you can see the gazebo.

The dream to prove that\nMagicks are more powerful than mere weapons and armor.  This man,\nArkisbane, was joined by other mages of his day. Together they sought to\nincrease the influence of magic in the land of Boinga.  To further this\ngoal they aligned themselves as a clan and purchased a place of refuge and\ncontemplation.\n \nIn the year when the great storm passed over the land, Arkisbane was\ncalled away to other lands.  He passed leadership of this new clan to one\nwhom he deemed worthy.  A time of growth and prosperity ensued.  Circle was\nquickly accepted in the land and all began to look to them as wise men and\nwomen. Then one day this leader was called away to other adventures.\n \nA period of darkness consumed Circle.  They floated for a time\n...without guidance.  Until one day a light renewed itself, and rose up out\nof the darkness to bring a new life to the Unending path of the Circle.\nMythorn had a vision.  A new way to govern a clan.  Not by rule of one man\nor woman, subject to his or her whims, but rule by a group, a council of\nthose who had long traveled the Path of the Magicks.  He prayed to the gods\nand it was ordained that there shall be four members in this 'innermost'\ngroup of Circle.  For by having four leaders Circle would never again be\nwithout a ruler.  Thus was born the tradition of the Inner Circle.\n \nThis first Inner Circle was short lived.  Two of the chosen four left\nthe realms of mortality and clanhood in search of the greater Magicks of\nimmortality. Four moons passed while Circle was once again ruled by one\nman, a man who was a capable and kind leader.  One who still had a dream of\na clan ruled by a group.\n \nAfter the fourth moon grew dim, Mythorn dreamt.  In his dream were\npresented to him the names of those who should next guide Circle.  Inner\nCircle once again rose into being.  This time cautions were taken to ensure\nthat there would always be leaders if one or more of the Inner Circle were\ncalled away.  Thus began the Outer Circle. Not officially leaders, but\ndesignated protectors and advisors for younger members.  Circle once again\nbegan to prosper as a clan.  Their ranks grew large and they became a\nfearsome force in the land of Boinga.  But still their main purpose was the\nstudy and teaching of Magicks.\n \nIn the year of the great gold dragon, a shadow passed across Circle.\nSome members sold themselves to the dark side and tried to turn the entire\nclan to the ways of evil.  But with the guidance of Mojo they were put in\ntheir places, and Circle was once again covered by a holy aura of\nprotection. During this time of upheaval many wise persons were lost to\nthe dark side.  Unfortunately none of them could be converted back, and\nthey were forever banished from the brotherhood.  Another brief period of\ndisarray ensued while new leaders were chosen to replace those who had\nleft. But this disarray was short lived, and when new leaders were voted\nupon, the doors were once again open for Circle to lead the way in search\nof ever greater and more powerful knowledge.\n \nMay the past serve to guide us in our future.\n-Recorded this Day of Ascension in the Year of the Coming.\n-With many thinks to the elders for their patient retelling of\nthe past to this humble servant.\n~\n#4433\ncircle guardian bracer~\na Circle Guardian bracer~\nThe bracer of a Circle Guardian lies here.~\ncopper~\njewelry G AM\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 10 550 P\nA\n5 1\n#4434\nmagus necklace~\na magus power necklace~\nA magus necklace lies here.~\nenergy~\njewelry G AC\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 20 550 P\nA\n12 10\nA\n5 1\n#4435\nchain lost soul~\nthe chain of the lost soul~\nA heavy steel chain lies here.~\nsteel~\nweapon 0 AN\nflail 3 7 crush I\n20 30 2800 P\nA\n19 3\nF\nA 0 0 I\n#4436\npromise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry F AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nA\n4 2\nA\n13 -20\n#4437\nstar chart~\nthe star chart~\n~\npaper~\nportal ORY P\n0 0 0 4440 0\n0 0 0 P\n#4438\nstar Anteres~\nAnteres~\nA large star lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor A AD\n1 1 1 0 0\n2 100 5000 P\nA\n1 1\nA\n5 1\n#4439\nevent horizon~\nan event horizon~\nTorn from the fabric of time and space, an event horizon lies here.~\nnothing~\ngem A AQ\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n13 10\n#4440\norion belt~\nOrion's Belt~\nA belt lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor AB AL\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n3 1\nA\n4 1\n#4441\nsentinel axe~\nThe Sentinel's Axe~\nAn axe lies here.~\nnothing~\nweapon C AN\nexotic 0 0 none 0\n22 20 0 P\n#4442\nancient promise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry EFHMd AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 MW\nA\n13 -20\nA\n4 2\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#4400\nThe Foyer~\nYou stand in the Tower of Clan Circle.

Chamber.  \nThe room is very dark and you can almost see the power eminating from the\nvarious portals that lead to unknown regions.  Against the back wall are\nseveral black gates, whose surfaces twist and churn with magical energy,\nlooking like a whirlpool of black waters.\n \nA large metalic plaque beckons for you to read it.\n~\n0 D 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nE\nmirror~\nThe mirror is aproximately 7 feet high and 5 feet wide.  The frame is\nmade of a hard metal, which harbors the most intricate designs you\nhave ever set eyes upon.  Huge snake like dragons are carved into\nthe frame, circling dozens of hour glasses.  The glass itself is\nsmooth and untarnished.  Peering into the reflective surface, you\ncome to realise that shadowy figures seem to be staring back at you\nfrom the other side of the glass.  \n~\nE\nmetalic plaque~\nThe plaque reads as follows:\n \n     Welcome to Circle's portal chamber.  This chamber calls forth on\n     great magical energies that have been put into the stone by the\n     old masters of magic.  A large mirror is used to create rifts\n     in time, which allows us to open gateways to other dimensions.\n     This in turn lets us travel from one place to another in very\n     little time.  The use of this wonderous magical relic is quite\n     simple.  Simply enter the portal while thinking of your desired\n     destination.\n      Example:     enter drow\n \nDimensional rifts currently accesible are: \n - Drow City        (enter drow)\n - Sand of Sorrow   (enter sands, enter sorrow)\n - Great Pyramid    (enter pyramid)\n - Elemental Canyon (enter canyon)\n - Old Thalos       (enter old, enter thalos)\n - Haon Dor Forest  (enter haon)\n~\nS\n#4410\nThe Herb Garden~\nThe south end of the Tower has been removed, and growing in the open air\nand sunshine is a garden of herbs.  A cobblestone path through the garden,\namong the well-trimmed hedges and carefully-tended flowers and plants.  There\nis no gardener in sight, perhaps these plants live off of the magic of the\nclan.

A soft layer of grass\ngrows magically out of floor, and a quiant, wooden gazebo with a comfortable\nswinging bench is located in the grass.

The wind at this height is strong, and \nthe altitude is somewhat dizzying, but the railings are secure, and the view\nis magnificent.  The spires of the hall reach towards the sky from just over\nyour head, and looking directly down, you can see the open courtyard on the\nthird floor, and the gazebo and herb garden on the second floor.\n~\n0 0 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4436\nS\n#4413\nThe Practice Room~\nTucked away in a unused wing of the Tower, the practice room is a safe place\nfor mages to apply their studies to experience.  The room is dark, and smells\nlike sulfur, probably a leftover from so many endless hours of fireballs and\nmagic missiles being hurled through the air.  Near the door to the room is\na small sign, with some admonishments for the would-be practicer.  \"Thou shalt\nnot practice thy combat spells on thy clanmates.\"  \"Thou canst kill thyself \nwith thine own magic missile.\"  \"If thou shoudst sleep thyself by accident, \nask not for help from thy clanmates, but certainly shouldst thou expect to be \nmercilessly teased for thine idiocy.\"  Mages always were a rather sarcastic \nbunch.\n~\n0 D 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4424\nS\n#4414\nThe Dungeons~\nNewly added after the tower was completed, the dungeons are not really all  \nthat bad.  Comfortable straw mattresses with cloth sheets and woolen blankets\nare shoved against the far wall, and magical barriers replace steel bars.  It\nappears that the dungeons were added as an afterthought, and have probably \nnever yet been used.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nD5\nExit ~\ngrate~\n16455 0 4439\nS\n#4415\nThe Alchemist's Lab~\nWhoever hired the alchemist to work for the clan is long gone, but Circle's\nmad scientist is still here, brewing potions and running a side operation in\ntangent with Wilf's Diner.

All that can be\nheard is the soft chanting of the healer who spends her time here.  She sits\nhere hour after hour ... day after day, waiting to be useful once again.  To \none side of the room lies a communal chest of donated items.

A small fire burns to heat the room when it is cold.\nThe walls are a soft white and glow with a pale radiance.  Champagne,\nale and various pre-mixed drinks are sitting on the bar's\ncounter.  Delicate foods are arranged on intricately designed chinaware.\nThe small curtained window looks out into the garden.  Through the window,\nin the far corner of the garden, you can see the gazebo.

The dream to prove that\nMagicks are more powerful than mere weapons and armor.  This man,\nArkisbane, was joined by other mages of his day. Together they sought to\nincrease the influence of magic in the land of Boinga.  To further this\ngoal they aligned themselves as a clan and purchased a place of refuge and\ncontemplation.\n \nIn the year when the great storm passed over the land, Arkisbane was\ncalled away to other lands.  He passed leadership of this new clan to one\nwhom he deemed worthy.  A time of growth and prosperity ensued.  Circle was\nquickly accepted in the land and all began to look to them as wise men and\nwomen. Then one day this leader was called away to other adventures.\n \nA period of darkness consumed Circle.  They floated for a time\n...without guidance.  Until one day a light renewed itself, and rose up out\nof the darkness to bring a new life to the Unending path of the Circle.\nMythorn had a vision.  A new way to govern a clan.  Not by rule of one man\nor woman, subject to his or her whims, but rule by a group, a council of\nthose who had long traveled the Path of the Magicks.  He prayed to the gods\nand it was ordained that there shall be four members in this 'innermost'\ngroup of Circle.  For by having four leaders Circle would never again be\nwithout a ruler.  Thus was born the tradition of the Inner Circle.\n \nThis first Inner Circle was short lived.  Two of the chosen four left\nthe realms of mortality and clanhood in search of the greater Magicks of\nimmortality. Four moons passed while Circle was once again ruled by one\nman, a man who was a capable and kind leader.  One who still had a dream of\na clan ruled by a group.\n \nAfter the fourth moon grew dim, Mythorn dreamt.  In his dream were\npresented to him the names of those who should next guide Circle.  Inner\nCircle once again rose into being.  This time cautions were taken to ensure\nthat there would always be leaders if one or more of the Inner Circle were\ncalled away.  Thus began the Outer Circle. Not officially leaders, but\ndesignated protectors and advisors for younger members.  Circle once again\nbegan to prosper as a clan.  Their ranks grew large and they became a\nfearsome force in the land of Boinga.  But still their main purpose was the\nstudy and teaching of Magicks.\n \nIn the year of the great gold dragon, a shadow passed across Circle.\nSome members sold themselves to the dark side and tried to turn the entire\nclan to the ways of evil.  But with the guidance of Mojo they were put in\ntheir places, and Circle was once again covered by a holy aura of\nprotection. During this time of upheaval many wise persons were lost to\nthe dark side.  Unfortunately none of them could be converted back, and\nthey were forever banished from the brotherhood.  Another brief period of\ndisarray ensued while new leaders were chosen to replace those who had\nleft. But this disarray was short lived, and when new leaders were voted\nupon, the doors were once again open for Circle to lead the way in search\nof ever greater and more powerful knowledge.\n \nMay the past serve to guide us in our future.\n-Recorded this Day of Ascension in the Year of the Coming.\n-With many thinks to the elders for their patient retelling of\nthe past to this humble servant.\n~\n#4433\ncircle guardian bracer~\na Circle Guardian bracer~\nThe bracer of a Circle Guardian lies here.~\ncopper~\njewelry G AM\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 10 550 P\nA\n5 1\n#4434\nmagus necklace~\na magus power necklace~\nA magus necklace lies here.~\nenergy~\njewelry G AC\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 20 550 P\nA\n12 10\nA\n5 1\n#4435\nchain lost soul~\nthe chain of the lost soul~\nA heavy steel chain lies here.~\nsteel~\nweapon 0 AN\nflail 3 7 crush I\n20 30 2800 P\nA\n19 3\nF\nA 0 0 I\n#4436\npromise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry F AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nA\n4 2\nA\n13 -20\n#4437\nstar chart~\nthe star chart~\n~\npaper~\nportal ORY P\n0 0 0 4440 0\n0 0 0 P\n#4438\nstar Anteres~\nAnteres~\nA large star lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor A AD\n1 1 1 0 0\n2 100 5000 P\nA\n1 1\nA\n5 1\n#4439\nevent horizon~\nan event horizon~\nTorn from the fabric of time and space, an event horizon lies here.~\nnothing~\ngem A AQ\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n13 10\n#4440\norion belt~\nOrion's Belt~\nA belt lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor AB AL\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n3 1\nA\n4 1\n#4441\nsentinel axe~\nThe Sentinel's Axe~\nAn axe lies here.~\nnothing~\nweapon C AN\nexotic 0 0 none 0\n22 20 0 P\n#4442\nancient promise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry EFHMd AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 MW\nA\n13 -20\nA\n4 2\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#4400\nThe Foyer~\nYou stand in the Tower of Clan Circle.

Chamber.  \nThe room is very dark and you can almost see the power eminating from the\nvarious portals that lead to unknown regions.  Against the back wall are\nseveral black gates, whose surfaces twist and churn with magical energy,\nlooking like a whirlpool of black waters.\n \nA large metalic plaque beckons for you to read it.\n~\n0 D 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nE\nmirror~\nThe mirror is aproximately 7 feet high and 5 feet wide.  The frame is\nmade of a hard metal, which harbors the most intricate designs you\nhave ever set eyes upon.  Huge snake like dragons are carved into\nthe frame, circling dozens of hour glasses.  The glass itself is\nsmooth and untarnished.  Peering into the reflective surface, you\ncome to realise that shadowy figures seem to be staring back at you\nfrom the other side of the glass.  \n~\nE\nmetalic plaque~\nThe plaque reads as follows:\n \n     Welcome to Circle's portal chamber.  This chamber calls forth on\n     great magical energies that have been put into the stone by the\n     old masters of magic.  A large mirror is used to create rifts\n     in time, which allows us to open gateways to other dimensions.\n     This in turn lets us travel from one place to another in very\n     little time.  The use of this wonderous magical relic is quite\n     simple.  Simply enter the portal while thinking of your desired\n     destination.\n      Example:     enter drow\n \nDimensional rifts currently accesible are: \n - Drow City        (enter drow)\n - Sand of Sorrow   (enter sands, enter sorrow)\n - Great Pyramid    (enter pyramid)\n - Elemental Canyon (enter canyon)\n - Old Thalos       (enter old, enter thalos)\n - Haon Dor Forest  (enter haon)\n~\nS\n#4410\nThe Herb Garden~\nThe south end of the Tower has been removed, and growing in the open air\nand sunshine is a garden of herbs.  A cobblestone path through the garden,\namong the well-trimmed hedges and carefully-tended flowers and plants.  There\nis no gardener in sight, perhaps these plants live off of the magic of the\nclan.  Various spell components are rare plants are grown and tended here,\nfor the use and enjoyment of the clan.\n~\n0 D 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4423\nS\n#4411\nThe Gazebo~\nAt the north end of the second floor, the wall of the Tower has been\ncut away, and fresh air flows freely into this room.  A soft layer of grass\ngrows magically out of floor, and a quiant, wooden gazebo with a comfortable\nswinging bench is located in the grass.  The room is very peaceful and offers\na little privacy from the rest of the clan.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4425\nS\n#4412\nThe Battlements~\nThe battlements of the Tower are mostly for show, but nevertheless, a wooden\npathway extends around the tower.  The wind at this height is strong, and \nthe altitude is somewhat dizzying, but the railings are secure, and the view\nis magnificent.  The spires of the hall reach towards the sky from just over\nyour head, and looking directly down, you can see the open courtyard on the\nthird floor, and the gazebo and herb garden on the second floor.\n~\n0 0 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4436\nS\n#4413\nThe Practice Room~\nTucked away in a unused wing of the Tower, the practice room is a safe place\nfor mages to apply their studies to experience.  The room is dark, and smells\nlike sulfur, probably a leftover from so many endless hours of fireballs and\nmagic missiles being hurled through the air.  Near the door to the room is\na small sign, with some admonishments for the would-be practicer.  \"Thou shalt\nnot practice thy combat spells on thy clanmates.\"  \"Thou canst kill thyself \nwith thine own magic missile.\"  \"If thou shoudst sleep thyself by accident, \nask not for help from thy clanmates, but certainly shouldst thou expect to be \nmercilessly teased for thine idiocy.\"  Mages always were a rather sarcastic \nbunch.\n~\n0 D 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4424\nS\n#4414\nThe Dungeons~\nNewly added after the tower was completed, the dungeons are not really all  \nthat bad.  Comfortable straw mattresses with cloth sheets and woolen blankets\nare shoved against the far wall, and magical barriers replace steel bars.  It\nappears that the dungeons were added as an afterthought, and have probably \nnever yet been used.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nD5\nExit ~\ngrate~\n16455 0 4439\nS\n#4415\nThe Alchemist's Lab~\nWhoever hired the alchemist to work for the clan is long gone, but Circle's\nmad scientist is still here, brewing potions and running a side operation in\ntangent with Wilf's Diner.  Seems that magic users have an appetite for\nbuffalo wings.\n~\n0 CD 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4422\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4405\nS\n#4416\nThe Healer's Room~\nAs you step into this room, a silence encloses you.  All that can be\nheard is the soft chanting of the healer who spends her time here.  She sits\nhere hour after hour ... day after day, waiting to be useful once again.  To \none side of the room lies a communal chest of donated items.  All clan members \nare invited to share in the surplus bounty of treasure.\n~\n0 D 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4420\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4405\nS\n#4417\nA Small, Cozy Room~\nThis small cozy room contains little furnishing except for a bed in\nthe corner.  A small fire burns to heat the room when it is cold.\nThe walls are a soft white and glow with a pale radiance.  Champagne,\nale and various pre-mixed drinks are sitting on the bar's\ncounter.  Delicate foods are arranged on intricately designed chinaware.\nThe small curtained window looks out into the garden.  Through the window,\nin the far corner of the garden, you can see the gazebo.  The scent of the\nherbs outside gently waft through the room.\n~\n0 CDJ 0\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4402\nS\n#4418\nThe Northwest Corner of the First Floor~\nThe hallway leads east to the Foyer, and south into the West Hall.  The\nwalls are decorated with a large painting of the Tower of Clan Circle, and\na commemorative plaque below it.  Hanging from the ceiling of this hallway\nis a circular brass ring, with 7 candles arranged around it, representing\nthe members of the Conclave of Circle.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4400\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4420\nE\nplaque~\nThe plaque reads, \"We, the Magi of Clan Circle do hereby dedicate this, our\nbastion of strength, the Tower of Clan Circle, to preserving our wisdom, our\nmagic, and our very lives.

This project was made possible by Clan Circle, and all\nof your individual donations and efforts.\"\n~\nS\n#4419\nThe Northeast Corner of the First Floor~\nThe hallway extends east and south from here.  Hanging on the walls are\nmany artifacts from Circle's past, famous weapons used by various clan members,\nand powerful magic items recovered from enemy hands and dangerous, distant\nlands.  The Sith Blade, The Dagger of Circle, and a few other, unidentifiable\nweapons are hung carefully here for show, a clear reminder of the power of\nour enchantments.\n~\n0 D 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4422\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4400\nS\n#4420\nThe West Hall of the First Floor~\nThis hall leads north and south, with an exit to the east which accesses  \nthe tower's core stairwell.  The west wall is covered with tapestries, depicting\nglorious moments of Circle's past.  There are pictures of the founding of the\nInner Circle, and another one displays several clan members discussing the\nrestructuring of the leadership.

The southern wall of the hall is not decorated.\nSeveral windows offer the view of the city of Midgaard, and of southern Boinga.\n~\n0 D 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4429\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4434\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4408\nS\n#4434\nThe Southeast Corner of the Third Floor~\nThis quiet corner of the Tower has only one decoration.  Hung carefully on \nthe wall between two magical blue flames is a portrait of Mandrake, the god \nwho left before his time.  Below the portrait is a small brass plaque, which\nsimply reads: \"Mandrake, You Shall Not Be Forgotton.\"  You feel somewhat sad,\nlooking at the portrait, but even more, you feel a sense of fullness and\nconfidence.\n~\n0 D 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4404\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4433\nS\n#4435\nThe Open Courtyard~\nThe eastern wall of the tower has been removed, and this edge of the tower\nopens up into the sky and air.  The floor above is only half-sized, and so\nyou can see straight into the sky from the courtyard.  An ivy-covered marble\narch leads back towards the interior of the tower.  Against the north wall \nthere is a semi-circular fountain with the statue of a great mage in the \nmiddle.  The water flows out of the mage's outstretched hands cascading down \nforming a watery shield.  The wind blows gently through the courtyard and\nyou swear you hear the words, \"Never ending, ever lasting...\"\n~\n0 K 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4434\nS\n#4436\nA Grand Staircase~\nA spiraling staircase connects the top floor of the tower with the others.\nIt descends downward to the third floor.\n~\n0 D 1\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4437\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4412\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4403\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4429\nS\n#4437\nThe Observatory~\nLocated at the very top of the Tower of Clan Circle, the Observatory is a  \nmassive, semi-circular shaped room.  Slits in the walls allow air to drift in\nand out of the room. A planesphere and star chart on the wall help the aspiring\nastronomers and astrologers to watch and observe the changing motions of the \nworld in the heavens.  The view from here is spectacular.  Just south of the\ntower, the spires of the Temple poke into view, while farther away you can see \nthe Midgaard River flowing lazily out of the city. To the north you can just \nsee Mt. Olympus on the horizon.  So close to the sky, you feel at one with \nnature, and with your own magic.\n~\n0 D 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4436\nS\n#4438\nA Wooden Stairwell~\nThe bottom of the Grand Staircase is secured to the floor of the basement.\nThe bottom part is made of finished oak, and supported by iron beams.

They floated for a time\n...without guidance.  Until one day a light renewed itself, and rose up out\nof the darkness to bring a new life to the Unending path of the Circle.\nMythorn had a vision.  A new way to govern a clan.  Not by rule of one man\nor woman, subject to his or her whims, but rule by a group, a council of\nthose who had long traveled the Path of the Magicks.  He prayed to the gods\nand it was ordained that there shall be four members in this 'innermost'\ngroup of Circle.  For by having four leaders Circle would never again be\nwithout a ruler.  Thus was born the tradition of the Inner Circle.\n \nThis first Inner Circle was short lived.  Two of the chosen four left\nthe realms of mortality and clanhood in search of the greater Magicks of\nimmortality. Four moons passed while Circle was once again ruled by one\nman, a man who was a capable and kind leader.  One who still had a dream of\na clan ruled by a group.\n \nAfter the fourth moon grew dim, Mythorn dreamt.  In his dream were\npresented to him the names of those who should next guide Circle.

But this disarray was short lived, and when new leaders were voted\nupon, the doors were once again open for Circle to lead the way in search\nof ever greater and more powerful knowledge.\n \nMay the past serve to guide us in our future.\n-Recorded this Day of Ascension in the Year of the Coming.\n-With many thinks to the elders for their patient retelling of\nthe past to this humble servant.\n~\n#4433\ncircle guardian bracer~\na Circle Guardian bracer~\nThe bracer of a Circle Guardian lies here.~\ncopper~\njewelry G AM\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 10 550 P\nA\n5 1\n#4434\nmagus necklace~\na magus power necklace~\nA magus necklace lies here.~\nenergy~\njewelry G AC\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 20 550 P\nA\n12 10\nA\n5 1\n#4435\nchain lost soul~\nthe chain of the lost soul~\nA heavy steel chain lies here.~\nsteel~\nweapon 0 AN\nflail 3 7 crush I\n20 30 2800 P\nA\n19 3\nF\nA 0 0 I\n#4436\npromise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry F AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nA\n4 2\nA\n13 -20\n#4437\nstar chart~\nthe star chart~\n~\npaper~\nportal ORY P\n0 0 0 4440 0\n0 0 0 P\n#4438\nstar Anteres~\nAnteres~\nA large star lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor A AD\n1 1 1 0 0\n2 100 5000 P\nA\n1 1\nA\n5 1\n#4439\nevent horizon~\nan event horizon~\nTorn from the fabric of time and space, an event horizon lies here.~\nnothing~\ngem A AQ\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n13 10\n#4440\norion belt~\nOrion's Belt~\nA belt lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor AB AL\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n3 1\nA\n4 1\n#4441\nsentinel axe~\nThe Sentinel's Axe~\nAn axe lies here.~\nnothing~\nweapon C AN\nexotic 0 0 none 0\n22 20 0 P\n#4442\nancient promise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry EFHMd AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 MW\nA\n13 -20\nA\n4 2\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#4400\nThe Foyer~\nYou stand in the Tower of Clan Circle.

Chamber.  \nThe room is very dark and you can almost see the power eminating from the\nvarious portals that lead to unknown regions.  Against the back wall are\nseveral black gates, whose surfaces twist and churn with magical energy,\nlooking like a whirlpool of black waters.\n \nA large metalic plaque beckons for you to read it.\n~\n0 D 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nE\nmirror~\nThe mirror is aproximately 7 feet high and 5 feet wide.  The frame is\nmade of a hard metal, which harbors the most intricate designs you\nhave ever set eyes upon.  Huge snake like dragons are carved into\nthe frame, circling dozens of hour glasses.  The glass itself is\nsmooth and untarnished.  Peering into the reflective surface, you\ncome to realise that shadowy figures seem to be staring back at you\nfrom the other side of the glass.  \n~\nE\nmetalic plaque~\nThe plaque reads as follows:\n \n     Welcome to Circle's portal chamber.  This chamber calls forth on\n     great magical energies that have been put into the stone by the\n     old masters of magic.  A large mirror is used to create rifts\n     in time, which allows us to open gateways to other dimensions.\n     This in turn lets us travel from one place to another in very\n     little time.  The use of this wonderous magical relic is quite\n     simple.  Simply enter the portal while thinking of your desired\n     destination.\n      Example:     enter drow\n \nDimensional rifts currently accesible are: \n - Drow City        (enter drow)\n - Sand of Sorrow   (enter sands, enter sorrow)\n - Great Pyramid    (enter pyramid)\n - Elemental Canyon (enter canyon)\n - Old Thalos       (enter old, enter thalos)\n - Haon Dor Forest  (enter haon)\n~\nS\n#4410\nThe Herb Garden~\nThe south end of the Tower has been removed, and growing in the open air\nand sunshine is a garden of herbs.  A cobblestone path through the garden,\namong the well-trimmed hedges and carefully-tended flowers and plants.  There\nis no gardener in sight, perhaps these plants live off of the magic of the\nclan.

A soft layer of grass\ngrows magically out of floor, and a quiant, wooden gazebo with a comfortable\nswinging bench is located in the grass.

The wind at this height is strong, and \nthe altitude is somewhat dizzying, but the railings are secure, and the view\nis magnificent.  The spires of the hall reach towards the sky from just over\nyour head, and looking directly down, you can see the open courtyard on the\nthird floor, and the gazebo and herb garden on the second floor.\n~\n0 0 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4436\nS\n#4413\nThe Practice Room~\nTucked away in a unused wing of the Tower, the practice room is a safe place\nfor mages to apply their studies to experience.  The room is dark, and smells\nlike sulfur, probably a leftover from so many endless hours of fireballs and\nmagic missiles being hurled through the air.  Near the door to the room is\na small sign, with some admonishments for the would-be practicer.  \"Thou shalt\nnot practice thy combat spells on thy clanmates.\"  \"Thou canst kill thyself \nwith thine own magic missile.\"  \"If thou shoudst sleep thyself by accident, \nask not for help from thy clanmates, but certainly shouldst thou expect to be \nmercilessly teased for thine idiocy.\"  Mages always were a rather sarcastic \nbunch.\n~\n0 D 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4424\nS\n#4414\nThe Dungeons~\nNewly added after the tower was completed, the dungeons are not really all  \nthat bad.  Comfortable straw mattresses with cloth sheets and woolen blankets\nare shoved against the far wall, and magical barriers replace steel bars.  It\nappears that the dungeons were added as an afterthought, and have probably \nnever yet been used.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nD5\nExit ~\ngrate~\n16455 0 4439\nS\n#4415\nThe Alchemist's Lab~\nWhoever hired the alchemist to work for the clan is long gone, but Circle's\nmad scientist is still here, brewing potions and running a side operation in\ntangent with Wilf's Diner.

All that can be\nheard is the soft chanting of the healer who spends her time here.  She sits\nhere hour after hour ... day after day, waiting to be useful once again.  To \none side of the room lies a communal chest of donated items.

A small fire burns to heat the room when it is cold.\nThe walls are a soft white and glow with a pale radiance.  Champagne,\nale and various pre-mixed drinks are sitting on the bar's\ncounter.  Delicate foods are arranged on intricately designed chinaware.\nThe small curtained window looks out into the garden.  Through the window,\nin the far corner of the garden, you can see the gazebo.

The dream to prove that\nMagicks are more powerful than mere weapons and armor.  This man,\nArkisbane, was joined by other mages of his day. Together they sought to\nincrease the influence of magic in the land of Boinga.  To further this\ngoal they aligned themselves as a clan and purchased a place of refuge and\ncontemplation.\n \nIn the year when the great storm passed over the land, Arkisbane was\ncalled away to other lands.  He passed leadership of this new clan to one\nwhom he deemed worthy.  A time of growth and prosperity ensued.  Circle was\nquickly accepted in the land and all began to look to them as wise men and\nwomen. Then one day this leader was called away to other adventures.\n \nA period of darkness consumed Circle.  They floated for a time\n...without guidance.  Until one day a light renewed itself, and rose up out\nof the darkness to bring a new life to the Unending path of the Circle.\nMythorn had a vision.  A new way to govern a clan.  Not by rule of one man\nor woman, subject to his or her whims, but rule by a group, a council of\nthose who had long traveled the Path of the Magicks.  He prayed to the gods\nand it was ordained that there shall be four members in this 'innermost'\ngroup of Circle.  For by having four leaders Circle would never again be\nwithout a ruler.  Thus was born the tradition of the Inner Circle.\n \nThis first Inner Circle was short lived.  Two of the chosen four left\nthe realms of mortality and clanhood in search of the greater Magicks of\nimmortality. Four moons passed while Circle was once again ruled by one\nman, a man who was a capable and kind leader.  One who still had a dream of\na clan ruled by a group.\n \nAfter the fourth moon grew dim, Mythorn dreamt.  In his dream were\npresented to him the names of those who should next guide Circle.  Inner\nCircle once again rose into being.  This time cautions were taken to ensure\nthat there would always be leaders if one or more of the Inner Circle were\ncalled away.  Thus began the Outer Circle. Not officially leaders, but\ndesignated protectors and advisors for younger members.  Circle once again\nbegan to prosper as a clan.  Their ranks grew large and they became a\nfearsome force in the land of Boinga.  But still their main purpose was the\nstudy and teaching of Magicks.\n \nIn the year of the great gold dragon, a shadow passed across Circle.\nSome members sold themselves to the dark side and tried to turn the entire\nclan to the ways of evil.  But with the guidance of Mojo they were put in\ntheir places, and Circle was once again covered by a holy aura of\nprotection. During this time of upheaval many wise persons were lost to\nthe dark side.  Unfortunately none of them could be converted back, and\nthey were forever banished from the brotherhood.  Another brief period of\ndisarray ensued while new leaders were chosen to replace those who had\nleft. But this disarray was short lived, and when new leaders were voted\nupon, the doors were once again open for Circle to lead the way in search\nof ever greater and more powerful knowledge.\n \nMay the past serve to guide us in our future.\n-Recorded this Day of Ascension in the Year of the Coming.\n-With many thinks to the elders for their patient retelling of\nthe past to this humble servant.\n~\n#4433\ncircle guardian bracer~\na Circle Guardian bracer~\nThe bracer of a Circle Guardian lies here.~\ncopper~\njewelry G AM\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 10 550 P\nA\n5 1\n#4434\nmagus necklace~\na magus power necklace~\nA magus necklace lies here.~\nenergy~\njewelry G AC\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 20 550 P\nA\n12 10\nA\n5 1\n#4435\nchain lost soul~\nthe chain of the lost soul~\nA heavy steel chain lies here.~\nsteel~\nweapon 0 AN\nflail 3 7 crush I\n20 30 2800 P\nA\n19 3\nF\nA 0 0 I\n#4436\npromise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry F AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nA\n4 2\nA\n13 -20\n#4437\nstar chart~\nthe star chart~\n~\npaper~\nportal ORY P\n0 0 0 4440 0\n0 0 0 P\n#4438\nstar Anteres~\nAnteres~\nA large star lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor A AD\n1 1 1 0 0\n2 100 5000 P\nA\n1 1\nA\n5 1\n#4439\nevent horizon~\nan event horizon~\nTorn from the fabric of time and space, an event horizon lies here.~\nnothing~\ngem A AQ\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n13 10\n#4440\norion belt~\nOrion's Belt~\nA belt lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor AB AL\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n3 1\nA\n4 1\n#4441\nsentinel axe~\nThe Sentinel's Axe~\nAn axe lies here.~\nnothing~\nweapon C AN\nexotic 0 0 none 0\n22 20 0 P\n#4442\nancient promise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry EFHMd AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 MW\nA\n13 -20\nA\n4 2\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#4400\nThe Foyer~\nYou stand in the Tower of Clan Circle.

Chamber.  \nThe room is very dark and you can almost see the power eminating from the\nvarious portals that lead to unknown regions.  Against the back wall are\nseveral black gates, whose surfaces twist and churn with magical energy,\nlooking like a whirlpool of black waters.\n \nA large metalic plaque beckons for you to read it.\n~\n0 D 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nE\nmirror~\nThe mirror is aproximately 7 feet high and 5 feet wide.  The frame is\nmade of a hard metal, which harbors the most intricate designs you\nhave ever set eyes upon.  Huge snake like dragons are carved into\nthe frame, circling dozens of hour glasses.  The glass itself is\nsmooth and untarnished.  Peering into the reflective surface, you\ncome to realise that shadowy figures seem to be staring back at you\nfrom the other side of the glass.  \n~\nE\nmetalic plaque~\nThe plaque reads as follows:\n \n     Welcome to Circle's portal chamber.  This chamber calls forth on\n     great magical energies that have been put into the stone by the\n     old masters of magic.  A large mirror is used to create rifts\n     in time, which allows us to open gateways to other dimensions.\n     This in turn lets us travel from one place to another in very\n     little time.  The use of this wonderous magical relic is quite\n     simple.  Simply enter the portal while thinking of your desired\n     destination.\n      Example:     enter drow\n \nDimensional rifts currently accesible are: \n - Drow City        (enter drow)\n - Sand of Sorrow   (enter sands, enter sorrow)\n - Great Pyramid    (enter pyramid)\n - Elemental Canyon (enter canyon)\n - Old Thalos       (enter old, enter thalos)\n - Haon Dor Forest  (enter haon)\n~\nS\n#4410\nThe Herb Garden~\nThe south end of the Tower has been removed, and growing in the open air\nand sunshine is a garden of herbs.  A cobblestone path through the garden,\namong the well-trimmed hedges and carefully-tended flowers and plants.  There\nis no gardener in sight, perhaps these plants live off of the magic of the\nclan.

A soft layer of grass\ngrows magically out of floor, and a quiant, wooden gazebo with a comfortable\nswinging bench is located in the grass.

The wind at this height is strong, and \nthe altitude is somewhat dizzying, but the railings are secure, and the view\nis magnificent.  The spires of the hall reach towards the sky from just over\nyour head, and looking directly down, you can see the open courtyard on the\nthird floor, and the gazebo and herb garden on the second floor.\n~\n0 0 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4436\nS\n#4413\nThe Practice Room~\nTucked away in a unused wing of the Tower, the practice room is a safe place\nfor mages to apply their studies to experience.  The room is dark, and smells\nlike sulfur, probably a leftover from so many endless hours of fireballs and\nmagic missiles being hurled through the air.  Near the door to the room is\na small sign, with some admonishments for the would-be practicer.  \"Thou shalt\nnot practice thy combat spells on thy clanmates.\"  \"Thou canst kill thyself \nwith thine own magic missile.\"  \"If thou shoudst sleep thyself by accident, \nask not for help from thy clanmates, but certainly shouldst thou expect to be \nmercilessly teased for thine idiocy.\"  Mages always were a rather sarcastic \nbunch.\n~\n0 D 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4424\nS\n#4414\nThe Dungeons~\nNewly added after the tower was completed, the dungeons are not really all  \nthat bad.  Comfortable straw mattresses with cloth sheets and woolen blankets\nare shoved against the far wall, and magical barriers replace steel bars.  It\nappears that the dungeons were added as an afterthought, and have probably \nnever yet been used.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nD5\nExit ~\ngrate~\n16455 0 4439\nS\n#4415\nThe Alchemist's Lab~\nWhoever hired the alchemist to work for the clan is long gone, but Circle's\nmad scientist is still here, brewing potions and running a side operation in\ntangent with Wilf's Diner.

All that can be\nheard is the soft chanting of the healer who spends her time here.  She sits\nhere hour after hour ... day after day, waiting to be useful once again.  To \none side of the room lies a communal chest of donated items.

A small fire burns to heat the room when it is cold.\nThe walls are a soft white and glow with a pale radiance.  Champagne,\nale and various pre-mixed drinks are sitting on the bar's\ncounter.  Delicate foods are arranged on intricately designed chinaware.\nThe small curtained window looks out into the garden.  Through the window,\nin the far corner of the garden, you can see the gazebo.

The dream to prove that\nMagicks are more powerful than mere weapons and armor.  This man,\nArkisbane, was joined by other mages of his day. Together they sought to\nincrease the influence of magic in the land of Boinga.  To further this\ngoal they aligned themselves as a clan and purchased a place of refuge and\ncontemplation.\n \nIn the year when the great storm passed over the land, Arkisbane was\ncalled away to other lands.  He passed leadership of this new clan to one\nwhom he deemed worthy.  A time of growth and prosperity ensued.  Circle was\nquickly accepted in the land and all began to look to them as wise men and\nwomen. Then one day this leader was called away to other adventures.\n \nA period of darkness consumed Circle.  They floated for a time\n...without guidance.  Until one day a light renewed itself, and rose up out\nof the darkness to bring a new life to the Unending path of the Circle.\nMythorn had a vision.  A new way to govern a clan.  Not by rule of one man\nor woman, subject to his or her whims, but rule by a group, a council of\nthose who had long traveled the Path of the Magicks.  He prayed to the gods\nand it was ordained that there shall be four members in this 'innermost'\ngroup of Circle.  For by having four leaders Circle would never again be\nwithout a ruler.  Thus was born the tradition of the Inner Circle.\n \nThis first Inner Circle was short lived.  Two of the chosen four left\nthe realms of mortality and clanhood in search of the greater Magicks of\nimmortality. Four moons passed while Circle was once again ruled by one\nman, a man who was a capable and kind leader.  One who still had a dream of\na clan ruled by a group.\n \nAfter the fourth moon grew dim, Mythorn dreamt.  In his dream were\npresented to him the names of those who should next guide Circle.  Inner\nCircle once again rose into being.  This time cautions were taken to ensure\nthat there would always be leaders if one or more of the Inner Circle were\ncalled away.  Thus began the Outer Circle. Not officially leaders, but\ndesignated protectors and advisors for younger members.  Circle once again\nbegan to prosper as a clan.  Their ranks grew large and they became a\nfearsome force in the land of Boinga.  But still their main purpose was the\nstudy and teaching of Magicks.\n \nIn the year of the great gold dragon, a shadow passed across Circle.\nSome members sold themselves to the dark side and tried to turn the entire\nclan to the ways of evil.  But with the guidance of Mojo they were put in\ntheir places, and Circle was once again covered by a holy aura of\nprotection. During this time of upheaval many wise persons were lost to\nthe dark side.  Unfortunately none of them could be converted back, and\nthey were forever banished from the brotherhood.  Another brief period of\ndisarray ensued while new leaders were chosen to replace those who had\nleft. But this disarray was short lived, and when new leaders were voted\nupon, the doors were once again open for Circle to lead the way in search\nof ever greater and more powerful knowledge.\n \nMay the past serve to guide us in our future.\n-Recorded this Day of Ascension in the Year of the Coming.\n-With many thinks to the elders for their patient retelling of\nthe past to this humble servant.\n~\n#4433\ncircle guardian bracer~\na Circle Guardian bracer~\nThe bracer of a Circle Guardian lies here.~\ncopper~\njewelry G AM\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 10 550 P\nA\n5 1\n#4434\nmagus necklace~\na magus power necklace~\nA magus necklace lies here.~\nenergy~\njewelry G AC\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 20 550 P\nA\n12 10\nA\n5 1\n#4435\nchain lost soul~\nthe chain of the lost soul~\nA heavy steel chain lies here.~\nsteel~\nweapon 0 AN\nflail 3 7 crush I\n20 30 2800 P\nA\n19 3\nF\nA 0 0 I\n#4436\npromise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry F AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nA\n4 2\nA\n13 -20\n#4437\nstar chart~\nthe star chart~\n~\npaper~\nportal ORY P\n0 0 0 4440 0\n0 0 0 P\n#4438\nstar Anteres~\nAnteres~\nA large star lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor A AD\n1 1 1 0 0\n2 100 5000 P\nA\n1 1\nA\n5 1\n#4439\nevent horizon~\nan event horizon~\nTorn from the fabric of time and space, an event horizon lies here.~\nnothing~\ngem A AQ\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n13 10\n#4440\norion belt~\nOrion's Belt~\nA belt lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor AB AL\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n3 1\nA\n4 1\n#4441\nsentinel axe~\nThe Sentinel's Axe~\nAn axe lies here.~\nnothing~\nweapon C AN\nexotic 0 0 none 0\n22 20 0 P\n#4442\nancient promise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry EFHMd AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 MW\nA\n13 -20\nA\n4 2\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#4400\nThe Foyer~\nYou stand in the Tower of Clan Circle.

Chamber.  \nThe room is very dark and you can almost see the power eminating from the\nvarious portals that lead to unknown regions.  Against the back wall are\nseveral black gates, whose surfaces twist and churn with magical energy,\nlooking like a whirlpool of black waters.\n \nA large metalic plaque beckons for you to read it.\n~\n0 D 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nE\nmirror~\nThe mirror is aproximately 7 feet high and 5 feet wide.  The frame is\nmade of a hard metal, which harbors the most intricate designs you\nhave ever set eyes upon.  Huge snake like dragons are carved into\nthe frame, circling dozens of hour glasses.  The glass itself is\nsmooth and untarnished.  Peering into the reflective surface, you\ncome to realise that shadowy figures seem to be staring back at you\nfrom the other side of the glass.  \n~\nE\nmetalic plaque~\nThe plaque reads as follows:\n \n     Welcome to Circle's portal chamber.  This chamber calls forth on\n     great magical energies that have been put into the stone by the\n     old masters of magic.  A large mirror is used to create rifts\n     in time, which allows us to open gateways to other dimensions.\n     This in turn lets us travel from one place to another in very\n     little time.  The use of this wonderous magical relic is quite\n     simple.  Simply enter the portal while thinking of your desired\n     destination.\n      Example:     enter drow\n \nDimensional rifts currently accesible are: \n - Drow City        (enter drow)\n - Sand of Sorrow   (enter sands, enter sorrow)\n - Great Pyramid    (enter pyramid)\n - Elemental Canyon (enter canyon)\n - Old Thalos       (enter old, enter thalos)\n - Haon Dor Forest  (enter haon)\n~\nS\n#4410\nThe Herb Garden~\nThe south end of the Tower has been removed, and growing in the open air\nand sunshine is a garden of herbs.  A cobblestone path through the garden,\namong the well-trimmed hedges and carefully-tended flowers and plants.  There\nis no gardener in sight, perhaps these plants live off of the magic of the\nclan.

A soft layer of grass\ngrows magically out of floor, and a quiant, wooden gazebo with a comfortable\nswinging bench is located in the grass.

The wind at this height is strong, and \nthe altitude is somewhat dizzying, but the railings are secure, and the view\nis magnificent.  The spires of the hall reach towards the sky from just over\nyour head, and looking directly down, you can see the open courtyard on the\nthird floor, and the gazebo and herb garden on the second floor.\n~\n0 0 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4436\nS\n#4413\nThe Practice Room~\nTucked away in a unused wing of the Tower, the practice room is a safe place\nfor mages to apply their studies to experience.  The room is dark, and smells\nlike sulfur, probably a leftover from so many endless hours of fireballs and\nmagic missiles being hurled through the air.  Near the door to the room is\na small sign, with some admonishments for the would-be practicer.  \"Thou shalt\nnot practice thy combat spells on thy clanmates.\"  \"Thou canst kill thyself \nwith thine own magic missile.\"  \"If thou shoudst sleep thyself by accident, \nask not for help from thy clanmates, but certainly shouldst thou expect to be \nmercilessly teased for thine idiocy.\"  Mages always were a rather sarcastic \nbunch.\n~\n0 D 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4424\nS\n#4414\nThe Dungeons~\nNewly added after the tower was completed, the dungeons are not really all  \nthat bad.  Comfortable straw mattresses with cloth sheets and woolen blankets\nare shoved against the far wall, and magical barriers replace steel bars.  It\nappears that the dungeons were added as an afterthought, and have probably \nnever yet been used.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nD5\nExit ~\ngrate~\n16455 0 4439\nS\n#4415\nThe Alchemist's Lab~\nWhoever hired the alchemist to work for the clan is long gone, but Circle's\nmad scientist is still here, brewing potions and running a side operation in\ntangent with Wilf's Diner.

All that can be\nheard is the soft chanting of the healer who spends her time here.  She sits\nhere hour after hour ... day after day, waiting to be useful once again.  To \none side of the room lies a communal chest of donated items.

A small fire burns to heat the room when it is cold.\nThe walls are a soft white and glow with a pale radiance.  Champagne,\nale and various pre-mixed drinks are sitting on the bar's\ncounter.  Delicate foods are arranged on intricately designed chinaware.\nThe small curtained window looks out into the garden.  Through the window,\nin the far corner of the garden, you can see the gazebo.

The dream to prove that\nMagicks are more powerful than mere weapons and armor.  This man,\nArkisbane, was joined by other mages of his day. Together they sought to\nincrease the influence of magic in the land of Boinga.  To further this\ngoal they aligned themselves as a clan and purchased a place of refuge and\ncontemplation.\n \nIn the year when the great storm passed over the land, Arkisbane was\ncalled away to other lands.  He passed leadership of this new clan to one\nwhom he deemed worthy.  A time of growth and prosperity ensued.  Circle was\nquickly accepted in the land and all began to look to them as wise men and\nwomen. Then one day this leader was called away to other adventures.\n \nA period of darkness consumed Circle.  They floated for a time\n...without guidance.  Until one day a light renewed itself, and rose up out\nof the darkness to bring a new life to the Unending path of the Circle.\nMythorn had a vision.  A new way to govern a clan.  Not by rule of one man\nor woman, subject to his or her whims, but rule by a group, a council of\nthose who had long traveled the Path of the Magicks.  He prayed to the gods\nand it was ordained that there shall be four members in this 'innermost'\ngroup of Circle.  For by having four leaders Circle would never again be\nwithout a ruler.  Thus was born the tradition of the Inner Circle.\n \nThis first Inner Circle was short lived.  Two of the chosen four left\nthe realms of mortality and clanhood in search of the greater Magicks of\nimmortality. Four moons passed while Circle was once again ruled by one\nman, a man who was a capable and kind leader.  One who still had a dream of\na clan ruled by a group.\n \nAfter the fourth moon grew dim, Mythorn dreamt.  In his dream were\npresented to him the names of those who should next guide Circle.  Inner\nCircle once again rose into being.  This time cautions were taken to ensure\nthat there would always be leaders if one or more of the Inner Circle were\ncalled away.  Thus began the Outer Circle. Not officially leaders, but\ndesignated protectors and advisors for younger members.  Circle once again\nbegan to prosper as a clan.  Their ranks grew large and they became a\nfearsome force in the land of Boinga.  But still their main purpose was the\nstudy and teaching of Magicks.\n \nIn the year of the great gold dragon, a shadow passed across Circle.\nSome members sold themselves to the dark side and tried to turn the entire\nclan to the ways of evil.  But with the guidance of Mojo they were put in\ntheir places, and Circle was once again covered by a holy aura of\nprotection. During this time of upheaval many wise persons were lost to\nthe dark side.  Unfortunately none of them could be converted back, and\nthey were forever banished from the brotherhood.  Another brief period of\ndisarray ensued while new leaders were chosen to replace those who had\nleft. But this disarray was short lived, and when new leaders were voted\nupon, the doors were once again open for Circle to lead the way in search\nof ever greater and more powerful knowledge.\n \nMay the past serve to guide us in our future.\n-Recorded this Day of Ascension in the Year of the Coming.\n-With many thinks to the elders for their patient retelling of\nthe past to this humble servant.\n~\n#4433\ncircle guardian bracer~\na Circle Guardian bracer~\nThe bracer of a Circle Guardian lies here.~\ncopper~\njewelry G AM\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 10 550 P\nA\n5 1\n#4434\nmagus necklace~\na magus power necklace~\nA magus necklace lies here.~\nenergy~\njewelry G AC\n0 0 0 0 0\n5 20 550 P\nA\n12 10\nA\n5 1\n#4435\nchain lost soul~\nthe chain of the lost soul~\nA heavy steel chain lies here.~\nsteel~\nweapon 0 AN\nflail 3 7 crush I\n20 30 2800 P\nA\n19 3\nF\nA 0 0 I\n#4436\npromise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry F AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nA\n4 2\nA\n13 -20\n#4437\nstar chart~\nthe star chart~\n~\npaper~\nportal ORY P\n0 0 0 4440 0\n0 0 0 P\n#4438\nstar Anteres~\nAnteres~\nA large star lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor A AD\n1 1 1 0 0\n2 100 5000 P\nA\n1 1\nA\n5 1\n#4439\nevent horizon~\nan event horizon~\nTorn from the fabric of time and space, an event horizon lies here.~\nnothing~\ngem A AQ\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n13 10\n#4440\norion belt~\nOrion's Belt~\nA belt lies here.~\nhydrogen~\narmor AB AL\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 100 0 P\nA\n3 1\nA\n4 1\n#4441\nsentinel axe~\nThe Sentinel's Axe~\nAn axe lies here.~\nnothing~\nweapon C AN\nexotic 0 0 none 0\n22 20 0 P\n#4442\nancient promise ring~\nan ancient promise ring~\nAn ancient ring lies here.~\ngold~\njewelry EFHMd AB\n0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 MW\nA\n13 -20\nA\n4 2\n#0\n\n#ROOMS\n#4400\nThe Foyer~\nYou stand in the Tower of Clan Circle.

Chamber.  \nThe room is very dark and you can almost see the power eminating from the\nvarious portals that lead to unknown regions.  Against the back wall are\nseveral black gates, whose surfaces twist and churn with magical energy,\nlooking like a whirlpool of black waters.\n \nA large metalic plaque beckons for you to read it.\n~\n0 D 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nE\nmirror~\nThe mirror is aproximately 7 feet high and 5 feet wide.  The frame is\nmade of a hard metal, which harbors the most intricate designs you\nhave ever set eyes upon.  Huge snake like dragons are carved into\nthe frame, circling dozens of hour glasses.  The glass itself is\nsmooth and untarnished.  Peering into the reflective surface, you\ncome to realise that shadowy figures seem to be staring back at you\nfrom the other side of the glass.  \n~\nE\nmetalic plaque~\nThe plaque reads as follows:\n \n     Welcome to Circle's portal chamber.  This chamber calls forth on\n     great magical energies that have been put into the stone by the\n     old masters of magic.  A large mirror is used to create rifts\n     in time, which allows us to open gateways to other dimensions.\n     This in turn lets us travel from one place to another in very\n     little time.  The use of this wonderous magical relic is quite\n     simple.  Simply enter the portal while thinking of your desired\n     destination.\n      Example:     enter drow\n \nDimensional rifts currently accesible are: \n - Drow City        (enter drow)\n - Sand of Sorrow   (enter sands, enter sorrow)\n - Great Pyramid    (enter pyramid)\n - Elemental Canyon (enter canyon)\n - Old Thalos       (enter old, enter thalos)\n - Haon Dor Forest  (enter haon)\n~\nS\n#4410\nThe Herb Garden~\nThe south end of the Tower has been removed, and growing in the open air\nand sunshine is a garden of herbs.  A cobblestone path through the garden,\namong the well-trimmed hedges and carefully-tended flowers and plants.  There\nis no gardener in sight, perhaps these plants live off of the magic of the\nclan.  Various spell components are rare plants are grown and tended here,\nfor the use and enjoyment of the clan.\n~\n0 D 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4423\nS\n#4411\nThe Gazebo~\nAt the north end of the second floor, the wall of the Tower has been\ncut away, and fresh air flows freely into this room.  A soft layer of grass\ngrows magically out of floor, and a quiant, wooden gazebo with a comfortable\nswinging bench is located in the grass.  The room is very peaceful and offers\na little privacy from the rest of the clan.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4425\nS\n#4412\nThe Battlements~\nThe battlements of the Tower are mostly for show, but nevertheless, a wooden\npathway extends around the tower.  The wind at this height is strong, and \nthe altitude is somewhat dizzying, but the railings are secure, and the view\nis magnificent.  The spires of the hall reach towards the sky from just over\nyour head, and looking directly down, you can see the open courtyard on the\nthird floor, and the gazebo and herb garden on the second floor.\n~\n0 0 1\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4436\nS\n#4413\nThe Practice Room~\nTucked away in a unused wing of the Tower, the practice room is a safe place\nfor mages to apply their studies to experience.  The room is dark, and smells\nlike sulfur, probably a leftover from so many endless hours of fireballs and\nmagic missiles being hurled through the air.  Near the door to the room is\na small sign, with some admonishments for the would-be practicer.  \"Thou shalt\nnot practice thy combat spells on thy clanmates.\"  \"Thou canst kill thyself \nwith thine own magic missile.\"  \"If thou shoudst sleep thyself by accident, \nask not for help from thy clanmates, but certainly shouldst thou expect to be \nmercilessly teased for thine idiocy.\"  Mages always were a rather sarcastic \nbunch.\n~\n0 D 1\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4424\nS\n#4414\nThe Dungeons~\nNewly added after the tower was completed, the dungeons are not really all  \nthat bad.  Comfortable straw mattresses with cloth sheets and woolen blankets\nare shoved against the far wall, and magical barriers replace steel bars.  It\nappears that the dungeons were added as an afterthought, and have probably \nnever yet been used.\n~\n0 D 1\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4438\nD5\nExit ~\ngrate~\n16455 0 4439\nS\n#4415\nThe Alchemist's Lab~\nWhoever hired the alchemist to work for the clan is long gone, but Circle's\nmad scientist is still here, brewing potions and running a side operation in\ntangent with Wilf's Diner.

All that can be\nheard is the soft chanting of the healer who spends her time here.  She sits\nhere hour after hour ... day after day, waiting to be useful once again.  To \none side of the room lies a communal chest of donated items.

A small fire burns to heat the room when it is cold.\nThe walls are a soft white and glow with a pale radiance.  Champagne,\nale and various pre-mixed drinks are sitting on the bar's\ncounter.  Delicate foods are arranged on intricately designed chinaware.\nThe small curtained window looks out into the garden.  Through the window,\nin the far corner of the garden, you can see the gazebo.

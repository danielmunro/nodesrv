The ground is soft but crunches\nslightly under your feet.  The forest floor is essentially a blanket of dead\npine needles littered over the ground, the result of years of the\nmagnificent trees shedding their needles.  The golden sun peeks through the\npine boughs that frame the perfectly periwinkle blue sky.  The air is silent\nand still.  Occasional shrill but pleasant bird calls break the silence and\necho through the fresh air.  You feel yourself slipping into an almost\nheavenly meditative trance as you stand here and witness nature at her\ncommunal best.  Like another plane of existence, a near nirvana, this\nethereal pine glade is a wonderful place to rest and restore your life force.\n~\n0 CDKTV 3\nM 125\nO Immortal~\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16487 6741 6791\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 6791\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 6791\nE\nowners~\nyou see the owners of the glade name's carved into a nearbye tree,\nit says, \"Nyaxtor and Sheeana forever\".\n~\nS\n#6791\nNyaxtor's Lair~\nYou step into a seemingly dank and lifeless cavern.\n \nSoft and soulful jazz music eminates from the walls.

Taking this unknown voice up on its offer ,\nyou step cautiously towards its source.  Suddenly a lava lamp lights up and\nspreads its groovy light throughout the cave.  The light reveals what looks\nlike a really nifty bead curtain.  You part the beads and enter the hidden\nroom. The floor is carpeted with a very hip shag rug.   Sitting temptingly\non a bean bag chair is a youthful and virile looking silver dragon.  He\nextends a claw and pulls you down into his lap, tail thumping happily on the\nfloor.  \"Welcome to the Lair o' Love, baby,\" he says with a devilish grin...\n~\n0 CDKTV 0\nO immortal~\nD0\nExit

The ground is soft but crunches\nslightly under your feet.  The forest floor is essentially a blanket of dead\npine needles littered over the ground, the result of years of the\nmagnificent trees shedding their needles.  The golden sun peeks through the\npine boughs that frame the perfectly periwinkle blue sky.  The air is silent\nand still.  Occasional shrill but pleasant bird calls break the silence and\necho through the fresh air.  You feel yourself slipping into an almost\nheavenly meditative trance as you stand here and witness nature at her\ncommunal best.  Like another plane of existence, a near nirvana, this\nethereal pine glade is a wonderful place to rest and restore your life force.\n~\n0 CDKTV 3\nM 125\nO Immortal~\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16487 6741 6791\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 6791\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 6791\nE\nowners~\nyou see the owners of the glade name's carved into a nearbye tree,\nit says, \"Nyaxtor and Sheeana forever\".\n~\nS\n#6791\nNyaxtor's Lair~\nYou step into a seemingly dank and lifeless cavern.\n \nSoft and soulful jazz music eminates from the walls.

Taking this unknown voice up on its offer ,\nyou step cautiously towards its source.  Suddenly a lava lamp lights up and\nspreads its groovy light throughout the cave.  The light reveals what looks\nlike a really nifty bead curtain.  You part the beads and enter the hidden\nroom. The floor is carpeted with a very hip shag rug.   Sitting temptingly\non a bean bag chair is a youthful and virile looking silver dragon.  He\nextends a claw and pulls you down into his lap, tail thumping happily on the\nfloor.  \"Welcome to the Lair o' Love, baby,\" he says with a devilish grin...\n~\n0 CDKTV 0\nO immortal~\nD0\nExit

The ground is soft but crunches\nslightly under your feet.  The forest floor is essentially a blanket of dead\npine needles littered over the ground, the result of years of the\nmagnificent trees shedding their needles.  The golden sun peeks through the\npine boughs that frame the perfectly periwinkle blue sky.  The air is silent\nand still.  Occasional shrill but pleasant bird calls break the silence and\necho through the fresh air.  You feel yourself slipping into an almost\nheavenly meditative trance as you stand here and witness nature at her\ncommunal best.  Like another plane of existence, a near nirvana, this\nethereal pine glade is a wonderful place to rest and restore your life force.\n~\n0 CDKTV 3\nM 125\nO Immortal~\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16487 6741 6791\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 6791\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 6791\nE\nowners~\nyou see the owners of the glade name's carved into a nearbye tree,\nit says, \"Nyaxtor and Sheeana forever\".\n~\nS\n#6791\nNyaxtor's Lair~\nYou step into a seemingly dank and lifeless cavern.\n \nSoft and soulful jazz music eminates from the walls.

Taking this unknown voice up on its offer ,\nyou step cautiously towards its source.  Suddenly a lava lamp lights up and\nspreads its groovy light throughout the cave.  The light reveals what looks\nlike a really nifty bead curtain.  You part the beads and enter the hidden\nroom. The floor is carpeted with a very hip shag rug.   Sitting temptingly\non a bean bag chair is a youthful and virile looking silver dragon.  He\nextends a claw and pulls you down into his lap, tail thumping happily on the\nfloor.  \"Welcome to the Lair o' Love, baby,\" he says with a devilish grin...\n~\n0 CDKTV 0\nO immortal~\nD0\nExit

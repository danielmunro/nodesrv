A large wooden mantlepiece is set over it, with a set of hooks for\nMandrake's claymore. Various items adorne it, and you think you catch sight\nof words carved into a small corner of the wood. You can't be sure, but you\nthink they say, \"Rebecca is the bestest.\"\nScattered about the room are polished wooden chairs and tables, and wall \nhangings are decorously placed. An enormous desk is in a corner, where the\nresident God does his paperwork. The well-padded chairs invite you to rest\nyour weary bones, and the small tables are placed perfectly so that you can\neasily reach the tankard of damned-fine Scottish whisky that appears there\nbefore your eyes.\nThe carvings on the wall catch your eye, seeming to move with the firelight.\nA portrait has been hung over the fireplace.\n~\n0 CDU 4\nE\ndesk~\nThe desk is set in corner to the right of the doors. It's made of the same\ndark walnut as the rest of the room's furniture, but its accompanying office\nchair is upholstered in a rich black leather and looks like a dream to sit \nin. The desk boasts a huge top area, which is strewn with various papers and\nquite a few writing instruments. Several amazingly etched and jewelled \ndaggers are set in stands on the edge of the desk, and a tartan sash is hung\nover one corner. A few tiny statuettes share the massive expanse, as well as\nthe enormous ink blotter in the middle, with a slew of magical pictures\nunder its protective cover. Upon closer inspection you can see the pictures\nare actual scenes of places all over Boinga; MidGaard, New Thalos, etc.\nWait a minute! The people in the pictures are moving! These are live scenes!\nSet on one corner, is a picture of a lovely woman. The frame is well-worn\nfrom having been picked up many times. You can just barely make out the name\nprinted on the frame....\"Rebecca\".\n~\nE\npicture, portrait, painting~\nThe portrait is large, framed in thick wood, inlaid with gold. The amazingly\nlife-like painting is that of the now-immortal Johnwa, but the picture seems\nto be of him when he was a mortal. Behind him, in the background, you can see\nenough of Midgaard to see he is standing in the Market Square, the late\nafternoon sun glinting crimson off his polished armor. Set into the bottom\nof the frame is a silver plate, engraved with the words:\n\"My good friend, Johnwa.\"\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables are dark-stained walnut with small, round tops and flowingly\ncarved legs in soothing patterns. A table accompanies each chair.\n~\nE\nchairs~\nThe chairs are incredibly comfortable-looking, and you ache to relax in one.\nThey are made of a dark-stained walnut, with expertly carved arms and legs,\nand are upholstered in the tartan of the castle's resident Clan.\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nThe fireplace is absolutely gigantic, and the chairs and tables are placed\nwell back from it. Even with the heavy chain screen, the roaring fire inside\nsends its warmth rolling out into the large room in thick waves of comfort,\nbanishing all traces of the cold of outside from your bones. The tree trunk\ninside the fireplace feeds the greedy flames, snapping and popping and\nreleasing showers of sparks, which mesmerize you as your gaze is lost in\nthe flickering dance of the fire.\n~\nE\nmantlepiece~\nThe mantlepiece is a nicely polished and stained piece of wood, treated to\nresist the heat of the roaring fire beneath it. Placed along its top are many\nsmall pieces of equipment and various knickknacks, picked up by Mandrake in\nhis many adventures as a mortal. Blackened armplates, twisted bracelets, and\nseveral small, jewel-encrusted knives are among the oddities displayed.\n~\nE\ncarvings~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls. They show scenes of battle, and the figures depicted seem\nto come alive in the flickering light. You can make out the features of some\nof history's greatest warriors; Such as Dazrin, Stonefist, Krantzstone, and\nShadowCat and Johnwa. They are shown locked in battle with the equally famous\nevildoers Korak, Fyron, Teppi, Gakan, Cable, Elik, Wormy, and Power himself.\n~\nE\nwalls~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls.

Tsk, tsk.\n~\nS\n#28001\nMain Hall~\nThis incredibly huge room is where the inhabitants of the castle and the\nsurrounding holdings come for feasting and general togetherness. There are\nalready a few people here and servants weave in and out amongst the many\ntables, balancing trays laden with mounds of steaming food and clay mugs of\nale and Scottish whiskey and scotch.\nThe main doors are behind you. Ahead are another pair of oaken doors; a\nsmaller version of the huge main ones. Off to your right, half hidden by\na heavy tapestry, is a solid-looking door of burnished metal.\nAnother, similar tapestry on the east wall has been partially pulled aside\nto reveal a darkeness around its edge.\nAll along the walls are smoking torches, and in between them are pieces of\narmor and weapons, some with names etched into the metal. Some names seem \nfamiliar and you have an urge to take a closer look.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28003\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28002\nD3\nExit ~\ntapestry~\n16387 0 28005\nD5\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28004\nE\nweapons , armor , walls~\nYou move closer to the mounted battle gear to see the names engraved\nupon them. After a shield bearing a Clan crest, you see a large sword\nthat appears to glow with its own inner fire. It's golden hilt is forged\nin the shape of the sun, and the name 'Dazrin' is etched deeply into its\nglittering blade. A magnificent weapon indeed.\nAnother sword catches your eye, mainly because of its sheer size. Its wide\nblade looks well-used and its hilt looks like it would only fit the hand of\na giant. Engraved right through the center of the nicks and gouges in the\nblade's metal is the name 'ShadowCat'.\nAfter it comes a chest plate, then a strange looking weapon. It seems to\nbe a dagger, but it's shaped like a starfish. At the hub of its five arms\nis engraved the name 'Johnwa'.\nThe next mounted piece of equipment is ever more odd. You could swear the\nweapon is a large set of, well, teeth! The four upper, middle teeth each\nhave a letter etched into then to spell the name 'Foun'. The sharpened\nteeth form a macabre grin, and you wonder just where the grim warrior who\nwielded these is now.\n~\nE\n/imm thanks =)~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\naround~\nThe room is filled with an almost hazy light by the guttering torches placed\nat intervals all arund the walls. Gleaming armor and weapons hang on hooks,\nsome with names etched into the battle-scarred metal. Some of the names seem\nfamiliar. The voices of the people at the many, scattered tables is a low\nmurmur with the background clinking of clay mugs and the odd raucaus song.\nServants continually brush by you with laden trays and the delicious smell\nof the food being served has you almost drooling where you stand. The ceiling\nis lost in shadow, the broad supporting beams blackened with age and smoke.\nThe floor is bare wood, rough and unpolished. There are large gaps between\nthe floorboards, allowing spilled food and drink to fall to the stone floor\nseveral feet down, where presumably rats and other wildlife consume it to\ntheir own animilistic pleasure.\n~\nE\ntorch~\nA torch. Duh.\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables a placed haphazardly about the room, creating a place where any\none table can join in on the conversation of another, even across the room.\nIt could possibly be the acoustic properties of the shadowy ceiling, but\nmore likely it is a little bit of magic by the owner of the castle.\nThe tables themselves are little more than slabs of wood on legs with rough\nbenches polished to a shiny finish by years of use. The tops of the tables\nare heavily scarred by gashes, spilled food and drink, and there are\nhundreds of names carved into the wood; names of warriors lost in battle,\nand those who have simply passed on and are remembered in song.\n~\nE\nup~\nA few of the gathered warriors chuckle at you gaping aimlessly upwards.\nPerhaps if you looked at something specific up there...like the ceiling...\n~\nE\nceiling , roof~\nThe wooden beams supporting the stone ceiling are blackened with age and\nsmoke. You detect movement, and discerne small rodentia scampering along\nthe supports.\n~\nS\n#28002\nAt the Castle's Main Entrance~\nThe huge doors set into the bleak stone wall of the castle are the only\nthing preventing raiders from entering the interior.

The landscape is the typical craggy highland\nwith rolling green hills and bare outcroppings of black rock with scrawny\ntrees and brush interspersed among the rock, all beneath a cold, grey sky.\nThe castle fits right in with the rest of the scenery, its stark, stone\nform pointing to the sky, unaffected by the brisk wind or uncaring elements.\n~\nE\ncastle~\nThe castle itself is little more than a fortress on the outside. It's cold\n, dark stone walls extend straight up to the grey sky, with the occasional\nslit window letting out the merest hint of light high above your head. The\ninterlocking stones are fitted so tightly so as to disallow the scaling of\nthe castle's walls. A definate sign of expert work by the builders.\n~\nE\ndoors~\nThe massive doors are made out of solid oak and are almost a foot thick.\nThey are reinforced with iron bands and the intricate carvings on their\nouter sides are badly marred by slash marks, telling stories of many\nrepelled raiding parties.\n~\nE\nsouth , east , west~\nThe wind picks up as you examine your surroundings, making you shiver.\nThe castle was built several hundred yards from a cliff with a sharp drop\nto the pounding surf below.

Jewels, rings, fine\nsilks, and piles of gold coins are strewn about the place like dirty\nlaundry. All around the walls of the room are opened chests and caskets\nwhich spill their precious contents to join the rest of the pretties on\nthe floor. The walls themselves are seamless metal, buffed to a high\nsheen and are almost mirrors. The light in the room is not provided by\ntorches like the rest of the castle, but by glowing balls of fuzzy white\nenergy which float about the room. Their light is reflected by the thousands\nupon thousands of coins and jewels and that in turn is reflected by the\nwalls until all you can see is a myriad of sparks of colorful light.\nThe center of the room, however, has been kept almost religiously clean.\nA soft, golden light comes down from the ceiling to bath a single, jewelled\ndagger lying on a pedestal.\nThe only exit is back west.\n~\n0 D 4\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28001\nE\nlight , ball , white~\nWell, its a ball of fuzzy, white light.

Multifaceted rubys,\nemeralds, diamonds, opals and others glint and shine in the pure, white\nlight in the room, drawing your gaze from one horrible tempting gem\nto another.

On closer\ninspection, you see that the floor is utterly clean, with no sign of the food\nthat continually drops through from above. Not even bones remain. You wonder\nhow this could be, then suddenly you have a sense of being watched, and hear\na rustling sound all around you.\nIn the dim light from above, you only see a way back up.\n~\n0 AD 4\nD4\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28001\nS\n#28005\nHidden Stairway~\nThis small room would have been perfectly hidden, had not some drunkard\ntugged the concealing tapestry out of line.

Then again, best leave things alone...just in case.\n~\nS\n#28006\nAnteroom~\nThis small room atop the stairs leaves just enough space for the two large\nguards standing to either side of the heavy oak doors leading west, and\nyou. The room is brightly lit by two tall braziers in the far corners\nopposite the stairs, and they make the little room just a bit stuffy.\nAs you make to enter the room, the eyes of the guards bore into you, taking\nin every detail as their hands hover close to their large swords.\nThe only exits are west and down.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28007\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 28005\nE\nbraziers , lights~\nThe braziers are thin and tall, with small bowls at the top with some sort\nof burning substabce in them.

It is obvious that this Clan makes\nup a pivotal fighting unit, for this war room is the best you have ever seen.\nLarge, incredibly detailed maps line the stone walls, and multi-colored\nflags dot the miniaturized landscapes. Against one wall is a large, blank\nwhite piece of material upon which is written various plans, strategies,\nand designs for seige towers. The center of the room is taken up by a huge\noval table, thick-topped and a glossy black. About twenty chairs are placed\naround it, with one more ornately designed than the others, presumably\nmeant for the clan's War Chief. More of the same standing braziers light\nthe room as well as provide a stuffy warmth.\nAside from the way you came in, the only other exits are a door to the\neast, and a small flight of stairs in the far corner, leading up.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28009\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28006\nD4\nExit ~\ntrapdoor~\n16387 0 28008\nE\ntable~\nThe table is simple enormous, able to seat twenty men with lots of elbow\nroom. Its glossy, pure black top is spotless, and while you assume it is\nmade from a tough wood, you can't seem to find any grain in its finish.\nAt each chair there is a blue folder with several sheets of paper in each,\nbearing a briefing on a proposed attack on a nearby castle. You quickly\nput the papers down before you are caught by someone and found snooping\n~\nE\nwhite , material , plans , strategies~\nThis white material is strange stuff indeed. The writing can be easily\nerased, and the thick writing instruments below it mark the material, but\nnot anything else. All over the broad board have been scrawled various\nstrategies for seiging castles, defending them, advancing, retreating, and\nmaking scotch while under fire. A short line of writing 'way down in one\ncorner catches your eye and you lean down to see that it says \n \n\"Quiver wuz here.\"\n \nYou pick up a marker to add your own line of wit, but decide against it. No\nsense in risking someone's anger.\n~\nE\nmaps~\nThese maps have been expertly rendered to scale and even have elevations.\nTiny colored flags have been affixed all over the maps, denoting positions\nof enemy castles, armies, allies, and the nearest corner store. The texture\nof these maps is so realistic that you have the urge to touch them, but fear\nyou'd dislodge the little flags.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nA large, white board made from a glossy material has been placed against\nthe north wall.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nAlong the south wall are amazingly rendered maps awash with little red flags.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in large squares of a highly polished material that\nresembles marble, but when tapped doesn't sound like stone.\n~\nS\n#28008\nCastle Parapet~\nYou come up out onto the top of the castle, underneath a bleak, grey sky.\nAll around you, along the outer walls, stone blocks have been placed to\nprotect the people on the roof, while allowing archers to fire down upon\ninvaders, and to pour oil and drop rocks. Racks of crossbows and arrows\nhave been set up at the archers' positions, covered by oilcloth so they\ndon't get wet. You also notice the massive catapult in the center of the\nroof, with its stack of ammunition.\nThe trapdoor behind you is the only exit.

The sky is an almost solid grey, with clouds\njammed together in what will become a thick fog overnight.

The high\nceiling is alive with dancing shadows from the room's fireplace, and you\ncan make out carvings in the huge wooden support beams, which depict the many\nscenes of Mandrake's colorful mortal existence.\nThe fireplace takes up one huge section of the far wall, keeping within\nits blackened interior a tame inferno which sends a warmth throughout the\nroom. A large wooden mantlepiece is set over it, with a set of hooks for\nMandrake's claymore. Various items adorne it, and you think you catch sight\nof words carved into a small corner of the wood. You can't be sure, but you\nthink they say, \"Rebecca is the bestest.\"\nScattered about the room are polished wooden chairs and tables, and wall \nhangings are decorously placed. An enormous desk is in a corner, where the\nresident God does his paperwork. The well-padded chairs invite you to rest\nyour weary bones, and the small tables are placed perfectly so that you can\neasily reach the tankard of damned-fine Scottish whisky that appears there\nbefore your eyes.\nThe carvings on the wall catch your eye, seeming to move with the firelight.\nA portrait has been hung over the fireplace.\n~\n0 CDU 4\nE\ndesk~\nThe desk is set in corner to the right of the doors. It's made of the same\ndark walnut as the rest of the room's furniture, but its accompanying office\nchair is upholstered in a rich black leather and looks like a dream to sit \nin. The desk boasts a huge top area, which is strewn with various papers and\nquite a few writing instruments. Several amazingly etched and jewelled \ndaggers are set in stands on the edge of the desk, and a tartan sash is hung\nover one corner. A few tiny statuettes share the massive expanse, as well as\nthe enormous ink blotter in the middle, with a slew of magical pictures\nunder its protective cover. Upon closer inspection you can see the pictures\nare actual scenes of places all over Boinga; MidGaard, New Thalos, etc.\nWait a minute! The people in the pictures are moving! These are live scenes!\nSet on one corner, is a picture of a lovely woman. The frame is well-worn\nfrom having been picked up many times. You can just barely make out the name\nprinted on the frame....\"Rebecca\".\n~\nE\npicture, portrait, painting~\nThe portrait is large, framed in thick wood, inlaid with gold. The amazingly\nlife-like painting is that of the now-immortal Johnwa, but the picture seems\nto be of him when he was a mortal. Behind him, in the background, you can see\nenough of Midgaard to see he is standing in the Market Square, the late\nafternoon sun glinting crimson off his polished armor. Set into the bottom\nof the frame is a silver plate, engraved with the words:\n\"My good friend, Johnwa.\"\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables are dark-stained walnut with small, round tops and flowingly\ncarved legs in soothing patterns. A table accompanies each chair.\n~\nE\nchairs~\nThe chairs are incredibly comfortable-looking, and you ache to relax in one.\nThey are made of a dark-stained walnut, with expertly carved arms and legs,\nand are upholstered in the tartan of the castle's resident Clan.\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nThe fireplace is absolutely gigantic, and the chairs and tables are placed\nwell back from it. Even with the heavy chain screen, the roaring fire inside\nsends its warmth rolling out into the large room in thick waves of comfort,\nbanishing all traces of the cold of outside from your bones. The tree trunk\ninside the fireplace feeds the greedy flames, snapping and popping and\nreleasing showers of sparks, which mesmerize you as your gaze is lost in\nthe flickering dance of the fire.\n~\nE\nmantlepiece~\nThe mantlepiece is a nicely polished and stained piece of wood, treated to\nresist the heat of the roaring fire beneath it. Placed along its top are many\nsmall pieces of equipment and various knickknacks, picked up by Mandrake in\nhis many adventures as a mortal. Blackened armplates, twisted bracelets, and\nseveral small, jewel-encrusted knives are among the oddities displayed.\n~\nE\ncarvings~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls. They show scenes of battle, and the figures depicted seem\nto come alive in the flickering light. You can make out the features of some\nof history's greatest warriors; Such as Dazrin, Stonefist, Krantzstone, and\nShadowCat and Johnwa. They are shown locked in battle with the equally famous\nevildoers Korak, Fyron, Teppi, Gakan, Cable, Elik, Wormy, and Power himself.\n~\nE\nwalls~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls.

Tsk, tsk.\n~\nS\n#28001\nMain Hall~\nThis incredibly huge room is where the inhabitants of the castle and the\nsurrounding holdings come for feasting and general togetherness. There are\nalready a few people here and servants weave in and out amongst the many\ntables, balancing trays laden with mounds of steaming food and clay mugs of\nale and Scottish whiskey and scotch.\nThe main doors are behind you. Ahead are another pair of oaken doors; a\nsmaller version of the huge main ones. Off to your right, half hidden by\na heavy tapestry, is a solid-looking door of burnished metal.\nAnother, similar tapestry on the east wall has been partially pulled aside\nto reveal a darkeness around its edge.\nAll along the walls are smoking torches, and in between them are pieces of\narmor and weapons, some with names etched into the metal. Some names seem \nfamiliar and you have an urge to take a closer look.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28003\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28002\nD3\nExit ~\ntapestry~\n16387 0 28005\nD5\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28004\nE\nweapons , armor , walls~\nYou move closer to the mounted battle gear to see the names engraved\nupon them. After a shield bearing a Clan crest, you see a large sword\nthat appears to glow with its own inner fire. It's golden hilt is forged\nin the shape of the sun, and the name 'Dazrin' is etched deeply into its\nglittering blade. A magnificent weapon indeed.\nAnother sword catches your eye, mainly because of its sheer size. Its wide\nblade looks well-used and its hilt looks like it would only fit the hand of\na giant. Engraved right through the center of the nicks and gouges in the\nblade's metal is the name 'ShadowCat'.\nAfter it comes a chest plate, then a strange looking weapon. It seems to\nbe a dagger, but it's shaped like a starfish. At the hub of its five arms\nis engraved the name 'Johnwa'.\nThe next mounted piece of equipment is ever more odd. You could swear the\nweapon is a large set of, well, teeth! The four upper, middle teeth each\nhave a letter etched into then to spell the name 'Foun'. The sharpened\nteeth form a macabre grin, and you wonder just where the grim warrior who\nwielded these is now.\n~\nE\n/imm thanks =)~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\naround~\nThe room is filled with an almost hazy light by the guttering torches placed\nat intervals all arund the walls. Gleaming armor and weapons hang on hooks,\nsome with names etched into the battle-scarred metal. Some of the names seem\nfamiliar. The voices of the people at the many, scattered tables is a low\nmurmur with the background clinking of clay mugs and the odd raucaus song.\nServants continually brush by you with laden trays and the delicious smell\nof the food being served has you almost drooling where you stand. The ceiling\nis lost in shadow, the broad supporting beams blackened with age and smoke.\nThe floor is bare wood, rough and unpolished. There are large gaps between\nthe floorboards, allowing spilled food and drink to fall to the stone floor\nseveral feet down, where presumably rats and other wildlife consume it to\ntheir own animilistic pleasure.\n~\nE\ntorch~\nA torch. Duh.\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables a placed haphazardly about the room, creating a place where any\none table can join in on the conversation of another, even across the room.\nIt could possibly be the acoustic properties of the shadowy ceiling, but\nmore likely it is a little bit of magic by the owner of the castle.\nThe tables themselves are little more than slabs of wood on legs with rough\nbenches polished to a shiny finish by years of use. The tops of the tables\nare heavily scarred by gashes, spilled food and drink, and there are\nhundreds of names carved into the wood; names of warriors lost in battle,\nand those who have simply passed on and are remembered in song.\n~\nE\nup~\nA few of the gathered warriors chuckle at you gaping aimlessly upwards.\nPerhaps if you looked at something specific up there...like the ceiling...\n~\nE\nceiling , roof~\nThe wooden beams supporting the stone ceiling are blackened with age and\nsmoke. You detect movement, and discerne small rodentia scampering along\nthe supports.\n~\nS\n#28002\nAt the Castle's Main Entrance~\nThe huge doors set into the bleak stone wall of the castle are the only\nthing preventing raiders from entering the interior.

The landscape is the typical craggy highland\nwith rolling green hills and bare outcroppings of black rock with scrawny\ntrees and brush interspersed among the rock, all beneath a cold, grey sky.\nThe castle fits right in with the rest of the scenery, its stark, stone\nform pointing to the sky, unaffected by the brisk wind or uncaring elements.\n~\nE\ncastle~\nThe castle itself is little more than a fortress on the outside. It's cold\n, dark stone walls extend straight up to the grey sky, with the occasional\nslit window letting out the merest hint of light high above your head. The\ninterlocking stones are fitted so tightly so as to disallow the scaling of\nthe castle's walls. A definate sign of expert work by the builders.\n~\nE\ndoors~\nThe massive doors are made out of solid oak and are almost a foot thick.\nThey are reinforced with iron bands and the intricate carvings on their\nouter sides are badly marred by slash marks, telling stories of many\nrepelled raiding parties.\n~\nE\nsouth , east , west~\nThe wind picks up as you examine your surroundings, making you shiver.\nThe castle was built several hundred yards from a cliff with a sharp drop\nto the pounding surf below.

Jewels, rings, fine\nsilks, and piles of gold coins are strewn about the place like dirty\nlaundry. All around the walls of the room are opened chests and caskets\nwhich spill their precious contents to join the rest of the pretties on\nthe floor. The walls themselves are seamless metal, buffed to a high\nsheen and are almost mirrors. The light in the room is not provided by\ntorches like the rest of the castle, but by glowing balls of fuzzy white\nenergy which float about the room. Their light is reflected by the thousands\nupon thousands of coins and jewels and that in turn is reflected by the\nwalls until all you can see is a myriad of sparks of colorful light.\nThe center of the room, however, has been kept almost religiously clean.\nA soft, golden light comes down from the ceiling to bath a single, jewelled\ndagger lying on a pedestal.\nThe only exit is back west.\n~\n0 D 4\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28001\nE\nlight , ball , white~\nWell, its a ball of fuzzy, white light.

Multifaceted rubys,\nemeralds, diamonds, opals and others glint and shine in the pure, white\nlight in the room, drawing your gaze from one horrible tempting gem\nto another.

On closer\ninspection, you see that the floor is utterly clean, with no sign of the food\nthat continually drops through from above. Not even bones remain.

The high\nceiling is alive with dancing shadows from the room's fireplace, and you\ncan make out carvings in the huge wooden support beams, which depict the many\nscenes of Mandrake's colorful mortal existence.\nThe fireplace takes up one huge section of the far wall, keeping within\nits blackened interior a tame inferno which sends a warmth throughout the\nroom. A large wooden mantlepiece is set over it, with a set of hooks for\nMandrake's claymore. Various items adorne it, and you think you catch sight\nof words carved into a small corner of the wood. You can't be sure, but you\nthink they say, \"Rebecca is the bestest.\"\nScattered about the room are polished wooden chairs and tables, and wall \nhangings are decorously placed. An enormous desk is in a corner, where the\nresident God does his paperwork. The well-padded chairs invite you to rest\nyour weary bones, and the small tables are placed perfectly so that you can\neasily reach the tankard of damned-fine Scottish whisky that appears there\nbefore your eyes.\nThe carvings on the wall catch your eye, seeming to move with the firelight.\nA portrait has been hung over the fireplace.\n~\n0 CDU 4\nE\ndesk~\nThe desk is set in corner to the right of the doors. It's made of the same\ndark walnut as the rest of the room's furniture, but its accompanying office\nchair is upholstered in a rich black leather and looks like a dream to sit \nin. The desk boasts a huge top area, which is strewn with various papers and\nquite a few writing instruments. Several amazingly etched and jewelled \ndaggers are set in stands on the edge of the desk, and a tartan sash is hung\nover one corner. A few tiny statuettes share the massive expanse, as well as\nthe enormous ink blotter in the middle, with a slew of magical pictures\nunder its protective cover. Upon closer inspection you can see the pictures\nare actual scenes of places all over Boinga; MidGaard, New Thalos, etc.\nWait a minute! The people in the pictures are moving! These are live scenes!\nSet on one corner, is a picture of a lovely woman. The frame is well-worn\nfrom having been picked up many times. You can just barely make out the name\nprinted on the frame....\"Rebecca\".\n~\nE\npicture, portrait, painting~\nThe portrait is large, framed in thick wood, inlaid with gold. The amazingly\nlife-like painting is that of the now-immortal Johnwa, but the picture seems\nto be of him when he was a mortal. Behind him, in the background, you can see\nenough of Midgaard to see he is standing in the Market Square, the late\nafternoon sun glinting crimson off his polished armor. Set into the bottom\nof the frame is a silver plate, engraved with the words:\n\"My good friend, Johnwa.\"\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables are dark-stained walnut with small, round tops and flowingly\ncarved legs in soothing patterns. A table accompanies each chair.\n~\nE\nchairs~\nThe chairs are incredibly comfortable-looking, and you ache to relax in one.\nThey are made of a dark-stained walnut, with expertly carved arms and legs,\nand are upholstered in the tartan of the castle's resident Clan.\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nThe fireplace is absolutely gigantic, and the chairs and tables are placed\nwell back from it. Even with the heavy chain screen, the roaring fire inside\nsends its warmth rolling out into the large room in thick waves of comfort,\nbanishing all traces of the cold of outside from your bones. The tree trunk\ninside the fireplace feeds the greedy flames, snapping and popping and\nreleasing showers of sparks, which mesmerize you as your gaze is lost in\nthe flickering dance of the fire.\n~\nE\nmantlepiece~\nThe mantlepiece is a nicely polished and stained piece of wood, treated to\nresist the heat of the roaring fire beneath it. Placed along its top are many\nsmall pieces of equipment and various knickknacks, picked up by Mandrake in\nhis many adventures as a mortal. Blackened armplates, twisted bracelets, and\nseveral small, jewel-encrusted knives are among the oddities displayed.\n~\nE\ncarvings~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls. They show scenes of battle, and the figures depicted seem\nto come alive in the flickering light. You can make out the features of some\nof history's greatest warriors; Such as Dazrin, Stonefist, Krantzstone, and\nShadowCat and Johnwa. They are shown locked in battle with the equally famous\nevildoers Korak, Fyron, Teppi, Gakan, Cable, Elik, Wormy, and Power himself.\n~\nE\nwalls~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls.

Tsk, tsk.\n~\nS\n#28001\nMain Hall~\nThis incredibly huge room is where the inhabitants of the castle and the\nsurrounding holdings come for feasting and general togetherness. There are\nalready a few people here and servants weave in and out amongst the many\ntables, balancing trays laden with mounds of steaming food and clay mugs of\nale and Scottish whiskey and scotch.\nThe main doors are behind you. Ahead are another pair of oaken doors; a\nsmaller version of the huge main ones. Off to your right, half hidden by\na heavy tapestry, is a solid-looking door of burnished metal.\nAnother, similar tapestry on the east wall has been partially pulled aside\nto reveal a darkeness around its edge.\nAll along the walls are smoking torches, and in between them are pieces of\narmor and weapons, some with names etched into the metal. Some names seem \nfamiliar and you have an urge to take a closer look.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28003\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28002\nD3\nExit ~\ntapestry~\n16387 0 28005\nD5\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28004\nE\nweapons , armor , walls~\nYou move closer to the mounted battle gear to see the names engraved\nupon them. After a shield bearing a Clan crest, you see a large sword\nthat appears to glow with its own inner fire. It's golden hilt is forged\nin the shape of the sun, and the name 'Dazrin' is etched deeply into its\nglittering blade. A magnificent weapon indeed.\nAnother sword catches your eye, mainly because of its sheer size. Its wide\nblade looks well-used and its hilt looks like it would only fit the hand of\na giant. Engraved right through the center of the nicks and gouges in the\nblade's metal is the name 'ShadowCat'.\nAfter it comes a chest plate, then a strange looking weapon. It seems to\nbe a dagger, but it's shaped like a starfish. At the hub of its five arms\nis engraved the name 'Johnwa'.\nThe next mounted piece of equipment is ever more odd. You could swear the\nweapon is a large set of, well, teeth! The four upper, middle teeth each\nhave a letter etched into then to spell the name 'Foun'. The sharpened\nteeth form a macabre grin, and you wonder just where the grim warrior who\nwielded these is now.\n~\nE\n/imm thanks =)~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\naround~\nThe room is filled with an almost hazy light by the guttering torches placed\nat intervals all arund the walls. Gleaming armor and weapons hang on hooks,\nsome with names etched into the battle-scarred metal. Some of the names seem\nfamiliar. The voices of the people at the many, scattered tables is a low\nmurmur with the background clinking of clay mugs and the odd raucaus song.\nServants continually brush by you with laden trays and the delicious smell\nof the food being served has you almost drooling where you stand. The ceiling\nis lost in shadow, the broad supporting beams blackened with age and smoke.\nThe floor is bare wood, rough and unpolished. There are large gaps between\nthe floorboards, allowing spilled food and drink to fall to the stone floor\nseveral feet down, where presumably rats and other wildlife consume it to\ntheir own animilistic pleasure.\n~\nE\ntorch~\nA torch. Duh.\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables a placed haphazardly about the room, creating a place where any\none table can join in on the conversation of another, even across the room.\nIt could possibly be the acoustic properties of the shadowy ceiling, but\nmore likely it is a little bit of magic by the owner of the castle.\nThe tables themselves are little more than slabs of wood on legs with rough\nbenches polished to a shiny finish by years of use. The tops of the tables\nare heavily scarred by gashes, spilled food and drink, and there are\nhundreds of names carved into the wood; names of warriors lost in battle,\nand those who have simply passed on and are remembered in song.\n~\nE\nup~\nA few of the gathered warriors chuckle at you gaping aimlessly upwards.\nPerhaps if you looked at something specific up there...like the ceiling...\n~\nE\nceiling , roof~\nThe wooden beams supporting the stone ceiling are blackened with age and\nsmoke.

A definate sign of expert work by the builders.\n~\nE\ndoors~\nThe massive doors are made out of solid oak and are almost a foot thick.\nThey are reinforced with iron bands and the intricate carvings on their\nouter sides are badly marred by slash marks, telling stories of many\nrepelled raiding parties.\n~\nE\nsouth , east , west~\nThe wind picks up as you examine your surroundings, making you shiver.\nThe castle was built several hundred yards from a cliff with a sharp drop\nto the pounding surf below.

Jewels, rings, fine\nsilks, and piles of gold coins are strewn about the place like dirty\nlaundry. All around the walls of the room are opened chests and caskets\nwhich spill their precious contents to join the rest of the pretties on\nthe floor. The walls themselves are seamless metal, buffed to a high\nsheen and are almost mirrors. The light in the room is not provided by\ntorches like the rest of the castle, but by glowing balls of fuzzy white\nenergy which float about the room. Their light is reflected by the thousands\nupon thousands of coins and jewels and that in turn is reflected by the\nwalls until all you can see is a myriad of sparks of colorful light.\nThe center of the room, however, has been kept almost religiously clean.\nA soft, golden light comes down from the ceiling to bath a single, jewelled\ndagger lying on a pedestal.\nThe only exit is back west.\n~\n0 D 4\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28001\nE\nlight , ball , white~\nWell, its a ball of fuzzy, white light.

Multifaceted rubys,\nemeralds, diamonds, opals and others glint and shine in the pure, white\nlight in the room, drawing your gaze from one horrible tempting gem\nto another.

On closer\ninspection, you see that the floor is utterly clean, with no sign of the food\nthat continually drops through from above. Not even bones remain.

The room is brightly lit by two tall braziers in the far corners\nopposite the stairs, and they make the little room just a bit stuffy.\nAs you make to enter the room, the eyes of the guards bore into you, taking\nin every detail as their hands hover close to their large swords.\nThe only exits are west and down.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28007\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 28005\nE\nbraziers , lights~\nThe braziers are thin and tall, with small bowls at the top with some sort\nof burning substabce in them.

It is obvious that this Clan makes\nup a pivotal fighting unit, for this war room is the best you have ever seen.\nLarge, incredibly detailed maps line the stone walls, and multi-colored\nflags dot the miniaturized landscapes. Against one wall is a large, blank\nwhite piece of material upon which is written various plans, strategies,\nand designs for seige towers. The center of the room is taken up by a huge\noval table, thick-topped and a glossy black. About twenty chairs are placed\naround it, with one more ornately designed than the others, presumably\nmeant for the clan's War Chief. More of the same standing braziers light\nthe room as well as provide a stuffy warmth.\nAside from the way you came in, the only other exits are a door to the\neast, and a small flight of stairs in the far corner, leading up.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28009\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28006\nD4\nExit ~\ntrapdoor~\n16387 0 28008\nE\ntable~\nThe table is simple enormous, able to seat twenty men with lots of elbow\nroom. Its glossy, pure black top is spotless, and while you assume it is\nmade from a tough wood, you can't seem to find any grain in its finish.\nAt each chair there is a blue folder with several sheets of paper in each,\nbearing a briefing on a proposed attack on a nearby castle. You quickly\nput the papers down before you are caught by someone and found snooping\n~\nE\nwhite , material , plans , strategies~\nThis white material is strange stuff indeed. The writing can be easily\nerased, and the thick writing instruments below it mark the material, but\nnot anything else. All over the broad board have been scrawled various\nstrategies for seiging castles, defending them, advancing, retreating, and\nmaking scotch while under fire. A short line of writing 'way down in one\ncorner catches your eye and you lean down to see that it says \n \n\"Quiver wuz here.\"\n \nYou pick up a marker to add your own line of wit, but decide against it. No\nsense in risking someone's anger.\n~\nE\nmaps~\nThese maps have been expertly rendered to scale and even have elevations.\nTiny colored flags have been affixed all over the maps, denoting positions\nof enemy castles, armies, allies, and the nearest corner store. The texture\nof these maps is so realistic that you have the urge to touch them, but fear\nyou'd dislodge the little flags.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nA large, white board made from a glossy material has been placed against\nthe north wall.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nAlong the south wall are amazingly rendered maps awash with little red flags.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in large squares of a highly polished material that\nresembles marble, but when tapped doesn't sound like stone.\n~\nS\n#28008\nCastle Parapet~\nYou come up out onto the top of the castle, underneath a bleak, grey sky.\nAll around you, along the outer walls, stone blocks have been placed to\nprotect the people on the roof, while allowing archers to fire down upon\ninvaders, and to pour oil and drop rocks. Racks of crossbows and arrows\nhave been set up at the archers' positions, covered by oilcloth so they\ndon't get wet.

The high\nceiling is alive with dancing shadows from the room's fireplace, and you\ncan make out carvings in the huge wooden support beams, which depict the many\nscenes of Mandrake's colorful mortal existence.\nThe fireplace takes up one huge section of the far wall, keeping within\nits blackened interior a tame inferno which sends a warmth throughout the\nroom. A large wooden mantlepiece is set over it, with a set of hooks for\nMandrake's claymore. Various items adorne it, and you think you catch sight\nof words carved into a small corner of the wood. You can't be sure, but you\nthink they say, \"Rebecca is the bestest.\"\nScattered about the room are polished wooden chairs and tables, and wall \nhangings are decorously placed. An enormous desk is in a corner, where the\nresident God does his paperwork. The well-padded chairs invite you to rest\nyour weary bones, and the small tables are placed perfectly so that you can\neasily reach the tankard of damned-fine Scottish whisky that appears there\nbefore your eyes.\nThe carvings on the wall catch your eye, seeming to move with the firelight.\nA portrait has been hung over the fireplace.\n~\n0 CDU 4\nE\ndesk~\nThe desk is set in corner to the right of the doors. It's made of the same\ndark walnut as the rest of the room's furniture, but its accompanying office\nchair is upholstered in a rich black leather and looks like a dream to sit \nin. The desk boasts a huge top area, which is strewn with various papers and\nquite a few writing instruments. Several amazingly etched and jewelled \ndaggers are set in stands on the edge of the desk, and a tartan sash is hung\nover one corner. A few tiny statuettes share the massive expanse, as well as\nthe enormous ink blotter in the middle, with a slew of magical pictures\nunder its protective cover. Upon closer inspection you can see the pictures\nare actual scenes of places all over Boinga; MidGaard, New Thalos, etc.\nWait a minute! The people in the pictures are moving! These are live scenes!\nSet on one corner, is a picture of a lovely woman. The frame is well-worn\nfrom having been picked up many times. You can just barely make out the name\nprinted on the frame....\"Rebecca\".\n~\nE\npicture, portrait, painting~\nThe portrait is large, framed in thick wood, inlaid with gold. The amazingly\nlife-like painting is that of the now-immortal Johnwa, but the picture seems\nto be of him when he was a mortal. Behind him, in the background, you can see\nenough of Midgaard to see he is standing in the Market Square, the late\nafternoon sun glinting crimson off his polished armor. Set into the bottom\nof the frame is a silver plate, engraved with the words:\n\"My good friend, Johnwa.\"\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables are dark-stained walnut with small, round tops and flowingly\ncarved legs in soothing patterns. A table accompanies each chair.\n~\nE\nchairs~\nThe chairs are incredibly comfortable-looking, and you ache to relax in one.\nThey are made of a dark-stained walnut, with expertly carved arms and legs,\nand are upholstered in the tartan of the castle's resident Clan.\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nThe fireplace is absolutely gigantic, and the chairs and tables are placed\nwell back from it. Even with the heavy chain screen, the roaring fire inside\nsends its warmth rolling out into the large room in thick waves of comfort,\nbanishing all traces of the cold of outside from your bones. The tree trunk\ninside the fireplace feeds the greedy flames, snapping and popping and\nreleasing showers of sparks, which mesmerize you as your gaze is lost in\nthe flickering dance of the fire.\n~\nE\nmantlepiece~\nThe mantlepiece is a nicely polished and stained piece of wood, treated to\nresist the heat of the roaring fire beneath it. Placed along its top are many\nsmall pieces of equipment and various knickknacks, picked up by Mandrake in\nhis many adventures as a mortal. Blackened armplates, twisted bracelets, and\nseveral small, jewel-encrusted knives are among the oddities displayed.\n~\nE\ncarvings~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls. They show scenes of battle, and the figures depicted seem\nto come alive in the flickering light. You can make out the features of some\nof history's greatest warriors; Such as Dazrin, Stonefist, Krantzstone, and\nShadowCat and Johnwa. They are shown locked in battle with the equally famous\nevildoers Korak, Fyron, Teppi, Gakan, Cable, Elik, Wormy, and Power himself.\n~\nE\nwalls~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls.

Tsk, tsk.\n~\nS\n#28001\nMain Hall~\nThis incredibly huge room is where the inhabitants of the castle and the\nsurrounding holdings come for feasting and general togetherness. There are\nalready a few people here and servants weave in and out amongst the many\ntables, balancing trays laden with mounds of steaming food and clay mugs of\nale and Scottish whiskey and scotch.\nThe main doors are behind you. Ahead are another pair of oaken doors; a\nsmaller version of the huge main ones. Off to your right, half hidden by\na heavy tapestry, is a solid-looking door of burnished metal.\nAnother, similar tapestry on the east wall has been partially pulled aside\nto reveal a darkeness around its edge.\nAll along the walls are smoking torches, and in between them are pieces of\narmor and weapons, some with names etched into the metal. Some names seem \nfamiliar and you have an urge to take a closer look.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28003\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28002\nD3\nExit ~\ntapestry~\n16387 0 28005\nD5\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28004\nE\nweapons , armor , walls~\nYou move closer to the mounted battle gear to see the names engraved\nupon them. After a shield bearing a Clan crest, you see a large sword\nthat appears to glow with its own inner fire. It's golden hilt is forged\nin the shape of the sun, and the name 'Dazrin' is etched deeply into its\nglittering blade. A magnificent weapon indeed.\nAnother sword catches your eye, mainly because of its sheer size. Its wide\nblade looks well-used and its hilt looks like it would only fit the hand of\na giant. Engraved right through the center of the nicks and gouges in the\nblade's metal is the name 'ShadowCat'.\nAfter it comes a chest plate, then a strange looking weapon. It seems to\nbe a dagger, but it's shaped like a starfish. At the hub of its five arms\nis engraved the name 'Johnwa'.\nThe next mounted piece of equipment is ever more odd. You could swear the\nweapon is a large set of, well, teeth! The four upper, middle teeth each\nhave a letter etched into then to spell the name 'Foun'. The sharpened\nteeth form a macabre grin, and you wonder just where the grim warrior who\nwielded these is now.\n~\nE\n/imm thanks =)~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\naround~\nThe room is filled with an almost hazy light by the guttering torches placed\nat intervals all arund the walls. Gleaming armor and weapons hang on hooks,\nsome with names etched into the battle-scarred metal. Some of the names seem\nfamiliar. The voices of the people at the many, scattered tables is a low\nmurmur with the background clinking of clay mugs and the odd raucaus song.\nServants continually brush by you with laden trays and the delicious smell\nof the food being served has you almost drooling where you stand. The ceiling\nis lost in shadow, the broad supporting beams blackened with age and smoke.\nThe floor is bare wood, rough and unpolished. There are large gaps between\nthe floorboards, allowing spilled food and drink to fall to the stone floor\nseveral feet down, where presumably rats and other wildlife consume it to\ntheir own animilistic pleasure.\n~\nE\ntorch~\nA torch. Duh.\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables a placed haphazardly about the room, creating a place where any\none table can join in on the conversation of another, even across the room.\nIt could possibly be the acoustic properties of the shadowy ceiling, but\nmore likely it is a little bit of magic by the owner of the castle.\nThe tables themselves are little more than slabs of wood on legs with rough\nbenches polished to a shiny finish by years of use. The tops of the tables\nare heavily scarred by gashes, spilled food and drink, and there are\nhundreds of names carved into the wood; names of warriors lost in battle,\nand those who have simply passed on and are remembered in song.\n~\nE\nup~\nA few of the gathered warriors chuckle at you gaping aimlessly upwards.\nPerhaps if you looked at something specific up there...like the ceiling...\n~\nE\nceiling , roof~\nThe wooden beams supporting the stone ceiling are blackened with age and\nsmoke. You detect movement, and discerne small rodentia scampering along\nthe supports.\n~\nS\n#28002\nAt the Castle's Main Entrance~\nThe huge doors set into the bleak stone wall of the castle are the only\nthing preventing raiders from entering the interior.

The landscape is the typical craggy highland\nwith rolling green hills and bare outcroppings of black rock with scrawny\ntrees and brush interspersed among the rock, all beneath a cold, grey sky.\nThe castle fits right in with the rest of the scenery, its stark, stone\nform pointing to the sky, unaffected by the brisk wind or uncaring elements.\n~\nE\ncastle~\nThe castle itself is little more than a fortress on the outside. It's cold\n, dark stone walls extend straight up to the grey sky, with the occasional\nslit window letting out the merest hint of light high above your head. The\ninterlocking stones are fitted so tightly so as to disallow the scaling of\nthe castle's walls. A definate sign of expert work by the builders.\n~\nE\ndoors~\nThe massive doors are made out of solid oak and are almost a foot thick.\nThey are reinforced with iron bands and the intricate carvings on their\nouter sides are badly marred by slash marks, telling stories of many\nrepelled raiding parties.\n~\nE\nsouth , east , west~\nThe wind picks up as you examine your surroundings, making you shiver.\nThe castle was built several hundred yards from a cliff with a sharp drop\nto the pounding surf below.

Jewels, rings, fine\nsilks, and piles of gold coins are strewn about the place like dirty\nlaundry. All around the walls of the room are opened chests and caskets\nwhich spill their precious contents to join the rest of the pretties on\nthe floor. The walls themselves are seamless metal, buffed to a high\nsheen and are almost mirrors. The light in the room is not provided by\ntorches like the rest of the castle, but by glowing balls of fuzzy white\nenergy which float about the room. Their light is reflected by the thousands\nupon thousands of coins and jewels and that in turn is reflected by the\nwalls until all you can see is a myriad of sparks of colorful light.\nThe center of the room, however, has been kept almost religiously clean.\nA soft, golden light comes down from the ceiling to bath a single, jewelled\ndagger lying on a pedestal.\nThe only exit is back west.\n~\n0 D 4\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28001\nE\nlight , ball , white~\nWell, its a ball of fuzzy, white light.

Multifaceted rubys,\nemeralds, diamonds, opals and others glint and shine in the pure, white\nlight in the room, drawing your gaze from one horrible tempting gem\nto another.

On closer\ninspection, you see that the floor is utterly clean, with no sign of the food\nthat continually drops through from above. Not even bones remain. You wonder\nhow this could be, then suddenly you have a sense of being watched, and hear\na rustling sound all around you.\nIn the dim light from above, you only see a way back up.\n~\n0 AD 4\nD4\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28001\nS\n#28005\nHidden Stairway~\nThis small room would have been perfectly hidden, had not some drunkard\ntugged the concealing tapestry out of line.

Then again, best leave things alone...just in case.\n~\nS\n#28006\nAnteroom~\nThis small room atop the stairs leaves just enough space for the two large\nguards standing to either side of the heavy oak doors leading west, and\nyou. The room is brightly lit by two tall braziers in the far corners\nopposite the stairs, and they make the little room just a bit stuffy.\nAs you make to enter the room, the eyes of the guards bore into you, taking\nin every detail as their hands hover close to their large swords.\nThe only exits are west and down.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28007\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 28005\nE\nbraziers , lights~\nThe braziers are thin and tall, with small bowls at the top with some sort\nof burning substabce in them.

It is obvious that this Clan makes\nup a pivotal fighting unit, for this war room is the best you have ever seen.\nLarge, incredibly detailed maps line the stone walls, and multi-colored\nflags dot the miniaturized landscapes. Against one wall is a large, blank\nwhite piece of material upon which is written various plans, strategies,\nand designs for seige towers. The center of the room is taken up by a huge\noval table, thick-topped and a glossy black. About twenty chairs are placed\naround it, with one more ornately designed than the others, presumably\nmeant for the clan's War Chief. More of the same standing braziers light\nthe room as well as provide a stuffy warmth.\nAside from the way you came in, the only other exits are a door to the\neast, and a small flight of stairs in the far corner, leading up.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28009\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28006\nD4\nExit ~\ntrapdoor~\n16387 0 28008\nE\ntable~\nThe table is simple enormous, able to seat twenty men with lots of elbow\nroom. Its glossy, pure black top is spotless, and while you assume it is\nmade from a tough wood, you can't seem to find any grain in its finish.\nAt each chair there is a blue folder with several sheets of paper in each,\nbearing a briefing on a proposed attack on a nearby castle. You quickly\nput the papers down before you are caught by someone and found snooping\n~\nE\nwhite , material , plans , strategies~\nThis white material is strange stuff indeed. The writing can be easily\nerased, and the thick writing instruments below it mark the material, but\nnot anything else. All over the broad board have been scrawled various\nstrategies for seiging castles, defending them, advancing, retreating, and\nmaking scotch while under fire. A short line of writing 'way down in one\ncorner catches your eye and you lean down to see that it says \n \n\"Quiver wuz here.\"\n \nYou pick up a marker to add your own line of wit, but decide against it. No\nsense in risking someone's anger.\n~\nE\nmaps~\nThese maps have been expertly rendered to scale and even have elevations.\nTiny colored flags have been affixed all over the maps, denoting positions\nof enemy castles, armies, allies, and the nearest corner store. The texture\nof these maps is so realistic that you have the urge to touch them, but fear\nyou'd dislodge the little flags.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nA large, white board made from a glossy material has been placed against\nthe north wall.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nAlong the south wall are amazingly rendered maps awash with little red flags.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in large squares of a highly polished material that\nresembles marble, but when tapped doesn't sound like stone.\n~\nS\n#28008\nCastle Parapet~\nYou come up out onto the top of the castle, underneath a bleak, grey sky.\nAll around you, along the outer walls, stone blocks have been placed to\nprotect the people on the roof, while allowing archers to fire down upon\ninvaders, and to pour oil and drop rocks. Racks of crossbows and arrows\nhave been set up at the archers' positions, covered by oilcloth so they\ndon't get wet.

The well-padded chairs invite you to rest\nyour weary bones, and the small tables are placed perfectly so that you can\neasily reach the tankard of damned-fine Scottish whisky that appears there\nbefore your eyes.\nThe carvings on the wall catch your eye, seeming to move with the firelight.\nA portrait has been hung over the fireplace.\n~\n0 CDU 4\nE\ndesk~\nThe desk is set in corner to the right of the doors. It's made of the same\ndark walnut as the rest of the room's furniture, but its accompanying office\nchair is upholstered in a rich black leather and looks like a dream to sit \nin. The desk boasts a huge top area, which is strewn with various papers and\nquite a few writing instruments. Several amazingly etched and jewelled \ndaggers are set in stands on the edge of the desk, and a tartan sash is hung\nover one corner. A few tiny statuettes share the massive expanse, as well as\nthe enormous ink blotter in the middle, with a slew of magical pictures\nunder its protective cover. Upon closer inspection you can see the pictures\nare actual scenes of places all over Boinga; MidGaard, New Thalos, etc.\nWait a minute! The people in the pictures are moving! These are live scenes!\nSet on one corner, is a picture of a lovely woman. The frame is well-worn\nfrom having been picked up many times. You can just barely make out the name\nprinted on the frame....\"Rebecca\".\n~\nE\npicture, portrait, painting~\nThe portrait is large, framed in thick wood, inlaid with gold. The amazingly\nlife-like painting is that of the now-immortal Johnwa, but the picture seems\nto be of him when he was a mortal. Behind him, in the background, you can see\nenough of Midgaard to see he is standing in the Market Square, the late\nafternoon sun glinting crimson off his polished armor. Set into the bottom\nof the frame is a silver plate, engraved with the words:\n\"My good friend, Johnwa.\"\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables are dark-stained walnut with small, round tops and flowingly\ncarved legs in soothing patterns. A table accompanies each chair.\n~\nE\nchairs~\nThe chairs are incredibly comfortable-looking, and you ache to relax in one.\nThey are made of a dark-stained walnut, with expertly carved arms and legs,\nand are upholstered in the tartan of the castle's resident Clan.\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nThe fireplace is absolutely gigantic, and the chairs and tables are placed\nwell back from it. Even with the heavy chain screen, the roaring fire inside\nsends its warmth rolling out into the large room in thick waves of comfort,\nbanishing all traces of the cold of outside from your bones. The tree trunk\ninside the fireplace feeds the greedy flames, snapping and popping and\nreleasing showers of sparks, which mesmerize you as your gaze is lost in\nthe flickering dance of the fire.\n~\nE\nmantlepiece~\nThe mantlepiece is a nicely polished and stained piece of wood, treated to\nresist the heat of the roaring fire beneath it. Placed along its top are many\nsmall pieces of equipment and various knickknacks, picked up by Mandrake in\nhis many adventures as a mortal. Blackened armplates, twisted bracelets, and\nseveral small, jewel-encrusted knives are among the oddities displayed.\n~\nE\ncarvings~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls. They show scenes of battle, and the figures depicted seem\nto come alive in the flickering light. You can make out the features of some\nof history's greatest warriors; Such as Dazrin, Stonefist, Krantzstone, and\nShadowCat and Johnwa. They are shown locked in battle with the equally famous\nevildoers Korak, Fyron, Teppi, Gakan, Cable, Elik, Wormy, and Power himself.\n~\nE\nwalls~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls.

Tsk, tsk.\n~\nS\n#28001\nMain Hall~\nThis incredibly huge room is where the inhabitants of the castle and the\nsurrounding holdings come for feasting and general togetherness. There are\nalready a few people here and servants weave in and out amongst the many\ntables, balancing trays laden with mounds of steaming food and clay mugs of\nale and Scottish whiskey and scotch.\nThe main doors are behind you. Ahead are another pair of oaken doors; a\nsmaller version of the huge main ones. Off to your right, half hidden by\na heavy tapestry, is a solid-looking door of burnished metal.\nAnother, similar tapestry on the east wall has been partially pulled aside\nto reveal a darkeness around its edge.\nAll along the walls are smoking torches, and in between them are pieces of\narmor and weapons, some with names etched into the metal. Some names seem \nfamiliar and you have an urge to take a closer look.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28003\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28002\nD3\nExit ~\ntapestry~\n16387 0 28005\nD5\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28004\nE\nweapons , armor , walls~\nYou move closer to the mounted battle gear to see the names engraved\nupon them. After a shield bearing a Clan crest, you see a large sword\nthat appears to glow with its own inner fire. It's golden hilt is forged\nin the shape of the sun, and the name 'Dazrin' is etched deeply into its\nglittering blade. A magnificent weapon indeed.\nAnother sword catches your eye, mainly because of its sheer size. Its wide\nblade looks well-used and its hilt looks like it would only fit the hand of\na giant. Engraved right through the center of the nicks and gouges in the\nblade's metal is the name 'ShadowCat'.\nAfter it comes a chest plate, then a strange looking weapon. It seems to\nbe a dagger, but it's shaped like a starfish. At the hub of its five arms\nis engraved the name 'Johnwa'.\nThe next mounted piece of equipment is ever more odd. You could swear the\nweapon is a large set of, well, teeth! The four upper, middle teeth each\nhave a letter etched into then to spell the name 'Foun'. The sharpened\nteeth form a macabre grin, and you wonder just where the grim warrior who\nwielded these is now.\n~\nE\n/imm thanks =)~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\naround~\nThe room is filled with an almost hazy light by the guttering torches placed\nat intervals all arund the walls. Gleaming armor and weapons hang on hooks,\nsome with names etched into the battle-scarred metal. Some of the names seem\nfamiliar. The voices of the people at the many, scattered tables is a low\nmurmur with the background clinking of clay mugs and the odd raucaus song.\nServants continually brush by you with laden trays and the delicious smell\nof the food being served has you almost drooling where you stand. The ceiling\nis lost in shadow, the broad supporting beams blackened with age and smoke.\nThe floor is bare wood, rough and unpolished. There are large gaps between\nthe floorboards, allowing spilled food and drink to fall to the stone floor\nseveral feet down, where presumably rats and other wildlife consume it to\ntheir own animilistic pleasure.\n~\nE\ntorch~\nA torch. Duh.\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables a placed haphazardly about the room, creating a place where any\none table can join in on the conversation of another, even across the room.\nIt could possibly be the acoustic properties of the shadowy ceiling, but\nmore likely it is a little bit of magic by the owner of the castle.\nThe tables themselves are little more than slabs of wood on legs with rough\nbenches polished to a shiny finish by years of use. The tops of the tables\nare heavily scarred by gashes, spilled food and drink, and there are\nhundreds of names carved into the wood; names of warriors lost in battle,\nand those who have simply passed on and are remembered in song.\n~\nE\nup~\nA few of the gathered warriors chuckle at you gaping aimlessly upwards.\nPerhaps if you looked at something specific up there...like the ceiling...\n~\nE\nceiling , roof~\nThe wooden beams supporting the stone ceiling are blackened with age and\nsmoke. You detect movement, and discerne small rodentia scampering along\nthe supports.\n~\nS\n#28002\nAt the Castle's Main Entrance~\nThe huge doors set into the bleak stone wall of the castle are the only\nthing preventing raiders from entering the interior.

The landscape is the typical craggy highland\nwith rolling green hills and bare outcroppings of black rock with scrawny\ntrees and brush interspersed among the rock, all beneath a cold, grey sky.\nThe castle fits right in with the rest of the scenery, its stark, stone\nform pointing to the sky, unaffected by the brisk wind or uncaring elements.\n~\nE\ncastle~\nThe castle itself is little more than a fortress on the outside. It's cold\n, dark stone walls extend straight up to the grey sky, with the occasional\nslit window letting out the merest hint of light high above your head. The\ninterlocking stones are fitted so tightly so as to disallow the scaling of\nthe castle's walls. A definate sign of expert work by the builders.\n~\nE\ndoors~\nThe massive doors are made out of solid oak and are almost a foot thick.\nThey are reinforced with iron bands and the intricate carvings on their\nouter sides are badly marred by slash marks, telling stories of many\nrepelled raiding parties.\n~\nE\nsouth , east , west~\nThe wind picks up as you examine your surroundings, making you shiver.\nThe castle was built several hundred yards from a cliff with a sharp drop\nto the pounding surf below.

Jewels, rings, fine\nsilks, and piles of gold coins are strewn about the place like dirty\nlaundry. All around the walls of the room are opened chests and caskets\nwhich spill their precious contents to join the rest of the pretties on\nthe floor. The walls themselves are seamless metal, buffed to a high\nsheen and are almost mirrors. The light in the room is not provided by\ntorches like the rest of the castle, but by glowing balls of fuzzy white\nenergy which float about the room. Their light is reflected by the thousands\nupon thousands of coins and jewels and that in turn is reflected by the\nwalls until all you can see is a myriad of sparks of colorful light.\nThe center of the room, however, has been kept almost religiously clean.\nA soft, golden light comes down from the ceiling to bath a single, jewelled\ndagger lying on a pedestal.\nThe only exit is back west.\n~\n0 D 4\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28001\nE\nlight , ball , white~\nWell, its a ball of fuzzy, white light.

Multifaceted rubys,\nemeralds, diamonds, opals and others glint and shine in the pure, white\nlight in the room, drawing your gaze from one horrible tempting gem\nto another.

On closer\ninspection, you see that the floor is utterly clean, with no sign of the food\nthat continually drops through from above. Not even bones remain. You wonder\nhow this could be, then suddenly you have a sense of being watched, and hear\na rustling sound all around you.\nIn the dim light from above, you only see a way back up.\n~\n0 AD 4\nD4\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28001\nS\n#28005\nHidden Stairway~\nThis small room would have been perfectly hidden, had not some drunkard\ntugged the concealing tapestry out of line.

The room is brightly lit by two tall braziers in the far corners\nopposite the stairs, and they make the little room just a bit stuffy.\nAs you make to enter the room, the eyes of the guards bore into you, taking\nin every detail as their hands hover close to their large swords.\nThe only exits are west and down.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28007\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 28005\nE\nbraziers , lights~\nThe braziers are thin and tall, with small bowls at the top with some sort\nof burning substabce in them.

It is obvious that this Clan makes\nup a pivotal fighting unit, for this war room is the best you have ever seen.\nLarge, incredibly detailed maps line the stone walls, and multi-colored\nflags dot the miniaturized landscapes. Against one wall is a large, blank\nwhite piece of material upon which is written various plans, strategies,\nand designs for seige towers. The center of the room is taken up by a huge\noval table, thick-topped and a glossy black. About twenty chairs are placed\naround it, with one more ornately designed than the others, presumably\nmeant for the clan's War Chief. More of the same standing braziers light\nthe room as well as provide a stuffy warmth.\nAside from the way you came in, the only other exits are a door to the\neast, and a small flight of stairs in the far corner, leading up.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28009\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28006\nD4\nExit ~\ntrapdoor~\n16387 0 28008\nE\ntable~\nThe table is simple enormous, able to seat twenty men with lots of elbow\nroom. Its glossy, pure black top is spotless, and while you assume it is\nmade from a tough wood, you can't seem to find any grain in its finish.\nAt each chair there is a blue folder with several sheets of paper in each,\nbearing a briefing on a proposed attack on a nearby castle. You quickly\nput the papers down before you are caught by someone and found snooping\n~\nE\nwhite , material , plans , strategies~\nThis white material is strange stuff indeed. The writing can be easily\nerased, and the thick writing instruments below it mark the material, but\nnot anything else. All over the broad board have been scrawled various\nstrategies for seiging castles, defending them, advancing, retreating, and\nmaking scotch while under fire. A short line of writing 'way down in one\ncorner catches your eye and you lean down to see that it says \n \n\"Quiver wuz here.\"\n \nYou pick up a marker to add your own line of wit, but decide against it. No\nsense in risking someone's anger.\n~\nE\nmaps~\nThese maps have been expertly rendered to scale and even have elevations.\nTiny colored flags have been affixed all over the maps, denoting positions\nof enemy castles, armies, allies, and the nearest corner store. The texture\nof these maps is so realistic that you have the urge to touch them, but fear\nyou'd dislodge the little flags.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nA large, white board made from a glossy material has been placed against\nthe north wall.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nAlong the south wall are amazingly rendered maps awash with little red flags.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in large squares of a highly polished material that\nresembles marble, but when tapped doesn't sound like stone.\n~\nS\n#28008\nCastle Parapet~\nYou come up out onto the top of the castle, underneath a bleak, grey sky.\nAll around you, along the outer walls, stone blocks have been placed to\nprotect the people on the roof, while allowing archers to fire down upon\ninvaders, and to pour oil and drop rocks. Racks of crossbows and arrows\nhave been set up at the archers' positions, covered by oilcloth so they\ndon't get wet.

The high\nceiling is alive with dancing shadows from the room's fireplace, and you\ncan make out carvings in the huge wooden support beams, which depict the many\nscenes of Mandrake's colorful mortal existence.\nThe fireplace takes up one huge section of the far wall, keeping within\nits blackened interior a tame inferno which sends a warmth throughout the\nroom. A large wooden mantlepiece is set over it, with a set of hooks for\nMandrake's claymore. Various items adorne it, and you think you catch sight\nof words carved into a small corner of the wood. You can't be sure, but you\nthink they say, \"Rebecca is the bestest.\"\nScattered about the room are polished wooden chairs and tables, and wall \nhangings are decorously placed. An enormous desk is in a corner, where the\nresident God does his paperwork. The well-padded chairs invite you to rest\nyour weary bones, and the small tables are placed perfectly so that you can\neasily reach the tankard of damned-fine Scottish whisky that appears there\nbefore your eyes.\nThe carvings on the wall catch your eye, seeming to move with the firelight.\nA portrait has been hung over the fireplace.\n~\n0 CDU 4\nE\ndesk~\nThe desk is set in corner to the right of the doors. It's made of the same\ndark walnut as the rest of the room's furniture, but its accompanying office\nchair is upholstered in a rich black leather and looks like a dream to sit \nin. The desk boasts a huge top area, which is strewn with various papers and\nquite a few writing instruments. Several amazingly etched and jewelled \ndaggers are set in stands on the edge of the desk, and a tartan sash is hung\nover one corner. A few tiny statuettes share the massive expanse, as well as\nthe enormous ink blotter in the middle, with a slew of magical pictures\nunder its protective cover. Upon closer inspection you can see the pictures\nare actual scenes of places all over Boinga; MidGaard, New Thalos, etc.\nWait a minute! The people in the pictures are moving! These are live scenes!\nSet on one corner, is a picture of a lovely woman. The frame is well-worn\nfrom having been picked up many times. You can just barely make out the name\nprinted on the frame....\"Rebecca\".\n~\nE\npicture, portrait, painting~\nThe portrait is large, framed in thick wood, inlaid with gold. The amazingly\nlife-like painting is that of the now-immortal Johnwa, but the picture seems\nto be of him when he was a mortal. Behind him, in the background, you can see\nenough of Midgaard to see he is standing in the Market Square, the late\nafternoon sun glinting crimson off his polished armor. Set into the bottom\nof the frame is a silver plate, engraved with the words:\n\"My good friend, Johnwa.\"\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables are dark-stained walnut with small, round tops and flowingly\ncarved legs in soothing patterns. A table accompanies each chair.\n~\nE\nchairs~\nThe chairs are incredibly comfortable-looking, and you ache to relax in one.\nThey are made of a dark-stained walnut, with expertly carved arms and legs,\nand are upholstered in the tartan of the castle's resident Clan.\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nThe fireplace is absolutely gigantic, and the chairs and tables are placed\nwell back from it. Even with the heavy chain screen, the roaring fire inside\nsends its warmth rolling out into the large room in thick waves of comfort,\nbanishing all traces of the cold of outside from your bones. The tree trunk\ninside the fireplace feeds the greedy flames, snapping and popping and\nreleasing showers of sparks, which mesmerize you as your gaze is lost in\nthe flickering dance of the fire.\n~\nE\nmantlepiece~\nThe mantlepiece is a nicely polished and stained piece of wood, treated to\nresist the heat of the roaring fire beneath it. Placed along its top are many\nsmall pieces of equipment and various knickknacks, picked up by Mandrake in\nhis many adventures as a mortal. Blackened armplates, twisted bracelets, and\nseveral small, jewel-encrusted knives are among the oddities displayed.\n~\nE\ncarvings~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls. They show scenes of battle, and the figures depicted seem\nto come alive in the flickering light. You can make out the features of some\nof history's greatest warriors; Such as Dazrin, Stonefist, Krantzstone, and\nShadowCat and Johnwa. They are shown locked in battle with the equally famous\nevildoers Korak, Fyron, Teppi, Gakan, Cable, Elik, Wormy, and Power himself.\n~\nE\nwalls~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls.

Tsk, tsk.\n~\nS\n#28001\nMain Hall~\nThis incredibly huge room is where the inhabitants of the castle and the\nsurrounding holdings come for feasting and general togetherness. There are\nalready a few people here and servants weave in and out amongst the many\ntables, balancing trays laden with mounds of steaming food and clay mugs of\nale and Scottish whiskey and scotch.\nThe main doors are behind you. Ahead are another pair of oaken doors; a\nsmaller version of the huge main ones. Off to your right, half hidden by\na heavy tapestry, is a solid-looking door of burnished metal.\nAnother, similar tapestry on the east wall has been partially pulled aside\nto reveal a darkeness around its edge.\nAll along the walls are smoking torches, and in between them are pieces of\narmor and weapons, some with names etched into the metal. Some names seem \nfamiliar and you have an urge to take a closer look.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28003\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28002\nD3\nExit ~\ntapestry~\n16387 0 28005\nD5\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28004\nE\nweapons , armor , walls~\nYou move closer to the mounted battle gear to see the names engraved\nupon them. After a shield bearing a Clan crest, you see a large sword\nthat appears to glow with its own inner fire. It's golden hilt is forged\nin the shape of the sun, and the name 'Dazrin' is etched deeply into its\nglittering blade. A magnificent weapon indeed.\nAnother sword catches your eye, mainly because of its sheer size. Its wide\nblade looks well-used and its hilt looks like it would only fit the hand of\na giant. Engraved right through the center of the nicks and gouges in the\nblade's metal is the name 'ShadowCat'.\nAfter it comes a chest plate, then a strange looking weapon. It seems to\nbe a dagger, but it's shaped like a starfish. At the hub of its five arms\nis engraved the name 'Johnwa'.\nThe next mounted piece of equipment is ever more odd. You could swear the\nweapon is a large set of, well, teeth! The four upper, middle teeth each\nhave a letter etched into then to spell the name 'Foun'. The sharpened\nteeth form a macabre grin, and you wonder just where the grim warrior who\nwielded these is now.\n~\nE\n/imm thanks =)~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\naround~\nThe room is filled with an almost hazy light by the guttering torches placed\nat intervals all arund the walls. Gleaming armor and weapons hang on hooks,\nsome with names etched into the battle-scarred metal. Some of the names seem\nfamiliar. The voices of the people at the many, scattered tables is a low\nmurmur with the background clinking of clay mugs and the odd raucaus song.\nServants continually brush by you with laden trays and the delicious smell\nof the food being served has you almost drooling where you stand. The ceiling\nis lost in shadow, the broad supporting beams blackened with age and smoke.\nThe floor is bare wood, rough and unpolished. There are large gaps between\nthe floorboards, allowing spilled food and drink to fall to the stone floor\nseveral feet down, where presumably rats and other wildlife consume it to\ntheir own animilistic pleasure.\n~\nE\ntorch~\nA torch. Duh.\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables a placed haphazardly about the room, creating a place where any\none table can join in on the conversation of another, even across the room.\nIt could possibly be the acoustic properties of the shadowy ceiling, but\nmore likely it is a little bit of magic by the owner of the castle.\nThe tables themselves are little more than slabs of wood on legs with rough\nbenches polished to a shiny finish by years of use. The tops of the tables\nare heavily scarred by gashes, spilled food and drink, and there are\nhundreds of names carved into the wood; names of warriors lost in battle,\nand those who have simply passed on and are remembered in song.\n~\nE\nup~\nA few of the gathered warriors chuckle at you gaping aimlessly upwards.\nPerhaps if you looked at something specific up there...like the ceiling...\n~\nE\nceiling , roof~\nThe wooden beams supporting the stone ceiling are blackened with age and\nsmoke. You detect movement, and discerne small rodentia scampering along\nthe supports.\n~\nS\n#28002\nAt the Castle's Main Entrance~\nThe huge doors set into the bleak stone wall of the castle are the only\nthing preventing raiders from entering the interior.

The landscape is the typical craggy highland\nwith rolling green hills and bare outcroppings of black rock with scrawny\ntrees and brush interspersed among the rock, all beneath a cold, grey sky.\nThe castle fits right in with the rest of the scenery, its stark, stone\nform pointing to the sky, unaffected by the brisk wind or uncaring elements.\n~\nE\ncastle~\nThe castle itself is little more than a fortress on the outside. It's cold\n, dark stone walls extend straight up to the grey sky, with the occasional\nslit window letting out the merest hint of light high above your head. The\ninterlocking stones are fitted so tightly so as to disallow the scaling of\nthe castle's walls. A definate sign of expert work by the builders.\n~\nE\ndoors~\nThe massive doors are made out of solid oak and are almost a foot thick.\nThey are reinforced with iron bands and the intricate carvings on their\nouter sides are badly marred by slash marks, telling stories of many\nrepelled raiding parties.\n~\nE\nsouth , east , west~\nThe wind picks up as you examine your surroundings, making you shiver.\nThe castle was built several hundred yards from a cliff with a sharp drop\nto the pounding surf below.

Jewels, rings, fine\nsilks, and piles of gold coins are strewn about the place like dirty\nlaundry. All around the walls of the room are opened chests and caskets\nwhich spill their precious contents to join the rest of the pretties on\nthe floor. The walls themselves are seamless metal, buffed to a high\nsheen and are almost mirrors. The light in the room is not provided by\ntorches like the rest of the castle, but by glowing balls of fuzzy white\nenergy which float about the room. Their light is reflected by the thousands\nupon thousands of coins and jewels and that in turn is reflected by the\nwalls until all you can see is a myriad of sparks of colorful light.\nThe center of the room, however, has been kept almost religiously clean.\nA soft, golden light comes down from the ceiling to bath a single, jewelled\ndagger lying on a pedestal.\nThe only exit is back west.\n~\n0 D 4\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28001\nE\nlight , ball , white~\nWell, its a ball of fuzzy, white light.

Multifaceted rubys,\nemeralds, diamonds, opals and others glint and shine in the pure, white\nlight in the room, drawing your gaze from one horrible tempting gem\nto another.

The high\nceiling is alive with dancing shadows from the room's fireplace, and you\ncan make out carvings in the huge wooden support beams, which depict the many\nscenes of Mandrake's colorful mortal existence.\nThe fireplace takes up one huge section of the far wall, keeping within\nits blackened interior a tame inferno which sends a warmth throughout the\nroom. A large wooden mantlepiece is set over it, with a set of hooks for\nMandrake's claymore. Various items adorne it, and you think you catch sight\nof words carved into a small corner of the wood. You can't be sure, but you\nthink they say, \"Rebecca is the bestest.\"\nScattered about the room are polished wooden chairs and tables, and wall \nhangings are decorously placed. An enormous desk is in a corner, where the\nresident God does his paperwork. The well-padded chairs invite you to rest\nyour weary bones, and the small tables are placed perfectly so that you can\neasily reach the tankard of damned-fine Scottish whisky that appears there\nbefore your eyes.\nThe carvings on the wall catch your eye, seeming to move with the firelight.\nA portrait has been hung over the fireplace.\n~\n0 CDU 4\nE\ndesk~\nThe desk is set in corner to the right of the doors. It's made of the same\ndark walnut as the rest of the room's furniture, but its accompanying office\nchair is upholstered in a rich black leather and looks like a dream to sit \nin. The desk boasts a huge top area, which is strewn with various papers and\nquite a few writing instruments. Several amazingly etched and jewelled \ndaggers are set in stands on the edge of the desk, and a tartan sash is hung\nover one corner. A few tiny statuettes share the massive expanse, as well as\nthe enormous ink blotter in the middle, with a slew of magical pictures\nunder its protective cover. Upon closer inspection you can see the pictures\nare actual scenes of places all over Boinga; MidGaard, New Thalos, etc.\nWait a minute! The people in the pictures are moving! These are live scenes!\nSet on one corner, is a picture of a lovely woman. The frame is well-worn\nfrom having been picked up many times. You can just barely make out the name\nprinted on the frame....\"Rebecca\".\n~\nE\npicture, portrait, painting~\nThe portrait is large, framed in thick wood, inlaid with gold. The amazingly\nlife-like painting is that of the now-immortal Johnwa, but the picture seems\nto be of him when he was a mortal. Behind him, in the background, you can see\nenough of Midgaard to see he is standing in the Market Square, the late\nafternoon sun glinting crimson off his polished armor. Set into the bottom\nof the frame is a silver plate, engraved with the words:\n\"My good friend, Johnwa.\"\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables are dark-stained walnut with small, round tops and flowingly\ncarved legs in soothing patterns. A table accompanies each chair.\n~\nE\nchairs~\nThe chairs are incredibly comfortable-looking, and you ache to relax in one.\nThey are made of a dark-stained walnut, with expertly carved arms and legs,\nand are upholstered in the tartan of the castle's resident Clan.\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nThe fireplace is absolutely gigantic, and the chairs and tables are placed\nwell back from it. Even with the heavy chain screen, the roaring fire inside\nsends its warmth rolling out into the large room in thick waves of comfort,\nbanishing all traces of the cold of outside from your bones. The tree trunk\ninside the fireplace feeds the greedy flames, snapping and popping and\nreleasing showers of sparks, which mesmerize you as your gaze is lost in\nthe flickering dance of the fire.\n~\nE\nmantlepiece~\nThe mantlepiece is a nicely polished and stained piece of wood, treated to\nresist the heat of the roaring fire beneath it. Placed along its top are many\nsmall pieces of equipment and various knickknacks, picked up by Mandrake in\nhis many adventures as a mortal. Blackened armplates, twisted bracelets, and\nseveral small, jewel-encrusted knives are among the oddities displayed.\n~\nE\ncarvings~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls. They show scenes of battle, and the figures depicted seem\nto come alive in the flickering light. You can make out the features of some\nof history's greatest warriors; Such as Dazrin, Stonefist, Krantzstone, and\nShadowCat and Johnwa. They are shown locked in battle with the equally famous\nevildoers Korak, Fyron, Teppi, Gakan, Cable, Elik, Wormy, and Power himself.\n~\nE\nwalls~\nThere are many images carved into the large stone blocks that make up the\ncastle's walls.

Tsk, tsk.\n~\nS\n#28001\nMain Hall~\nThis incredibly huge room is where the inhabitants of the castle and the\nsurrounding holdings come for feasting and general togetherness. There are\nalready a few people here and servants weave in and out amongst the many\ntables, balancing trays laden with mounds of steaming food and clay mugs of\nale and Scottish whiskey and scotch.\nThe main doors are behind you. Ahead are another pair of oaken doors; a\nsmaller version of the huge main ones. Off to your right, half hidden by\na heavy tapestry, is a solid-looking door of burnished metal.\nAnother, similar tapestry on the east wall has been partially pulled aside\nto reveal a darkeness around its edge.\nAll along the walls are smoking torches, and in between them are pieces of\narmor and weapons, some with names etched into the metal. Some names seem \nfamiliar and you have an urge to take a closer look.\n~\n0 D 4\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28003\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 28002\nD3\nExit ~\ntapestry~\n16387 0 28005\nD5\nExit ~\nfloorboard~\n16387 0 28004\nE\nweapons , armor , walls~\nYou move closer to the mounted battle gear to see the names engraved\nupon them. After a shield bearing a Clan crest, you see a large sword\nthat appears to glow with its own inner fire. It's golden hilt is forged\nin the shape of the sun, and the name 'Dazrin' is etched deeply into its\nglittering blade. A magnificent weapon indeed.\nAnother sword catches your eye, mainly because of its sheer size. Its wide\nblade looks well-used and its hilt looks like it would only fit the hand of\na giant. Engraved right through the center of the nicks and gouges in the\nblade's metal is the name 'ShadowCat'.\nAfter it comes a chest plate, then a strange looking weapon. It seems to\nbe a dagger, but it's shaped like a starfish. At the hub of its five arms\nis engraved the name 'Johnwa'.\nThe next mounted piece of equipment is ever more odd. You could swear the\nweapon is a large set of, well, teeth! The four upper, middle teeth each\nhave a letter etched into then to spell the name 'Foun'. The sharpened\nteeth form a macabre grin, and you wonder just where the grim warrior who\nwielded these is now.\n~\nE\n/imm thanks =)~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\naround~\nThe room is filled with an almost hazy light by the guttering torches placed\nat intervals all arund the walls. Gleaming armor and weapons hang on hooks,\nsome with names etched into the battle-scarred metal. Some of the names seem\nfamiliar. The voices of the people at the many, scattered tables is a low\nmurmur with the background clinking of clay mugs and the odd raucaus song.\nServants continually brush by you with laden trays and the delicious smell\nof the food being served has you almost drooling where you stand. The ceiling\nis lost in shadow, the broad supporting beams blackened with age and smoke.\nThe floor is bare wood, rough and unpolished. There are large gaps between\nthe floorboards, allowing spilled food and drink to fall to the stone floor\nseveral feet down, where presumably rats and other wildlife consume it to\ntheir own animilistic pleasure.\n~\nE\ntorch~\nA torch. Duh.\n~\nE\ntables~\nThe tables a placed haphazardly about the room, creating a place where any\none table can join in on the conversation of another, even across the room.\nIt could possibly be the acoustic properties of the shadowy ceiling, but\nmore likely it is a little bit of magic by the owner of the castle.\nThe tables themselves are little more than slabs of wood on legs with rough\nbenches polished to a shiny finish by years of use. The tops of the tables\nare heavily scarred by gashes, spilled food and drink, and there are\nhundreds of names carved into the wood; names of warriors lost in battle,\nand those who have simply passed on and are remembered in song.\n~\nE\nup~\nA few of the gathered warriors chuckle at you gaping aimlessly upwards.\nPerhaps if you looked at something specific up there...like the ceiling...\n~\nE\nceiling , roof~\nThe wooden beams supporting the stone ceiling are blackened with age and\nsmoke. You detect movement, and discerne small rodentia scampering along\nthe supports.\n~\nS\n#28002\nAt the Castle's Main Entrance~\nThe huge doors set into the bleak stone wall of the castle are the only\nthing preventing raiders from entering the interior.

The landscape is the typical craggy highland\nwith rolling green hills and bare outcroppings of black rock with scrawny\ntrees and brush interspersed among the rock, all beneath a cold, grey sky.\nThe castle fits right in with the rest of the scenery, its stark, stone\nform pointing to the sky, unaffected by the brisk wind or uncaring elements.\n~\nE\ncastle~\nThe castle itself is little more than a fortress on the outside. It's cold\n, dark stone walls extend straight up to the grey sky, with the occasional\nslit window letting out the merest hint of light high above your head. The\ninterlocking stones are fitted so tightly so as to disallow the scaling of\nthe castle's walls. A definate sign of expert work by the builders.\n~\nE\ndoors~\nThe massive doors are made out of solid oak and are almost a foot thick.\nThey are reinforced with iron bands and the intricate carvings on their\nouter sides are badly marred by slash marks, telling stories of many\nrepelled raiding parties.\n~\nE\nsouth , east , west~\nThe wind picks up as you examine your surroundings, making you shiver.\nThe castle was built several hundred yards from a cliff with a sharp drop\nto the pounding surf below.

Jewels, rings, fine\nsilks, and piles of gold coins are strewn about the place like dirty\nlaundry. All around the walls of the room are opened chests and caskets\nwhich spill their precious contents to join the rest of the pretties on\nthe floor. The walls themselves are seamless metal, buffed to a high\nsheen and are almost mirrors. The light in the room is not provided by\ntorches like the rest of the castle, but by glowing balls of fuzzy white\nenergy which float about the room. Their light is reflected by the thousands\nupon thousands of coins and jewels and that in turn is reflected by the\nwalls until all you can see is a myriad of sparks of colorful light.\nThe center of the room, however, has been kept almost religiously clean.\nA soft, golden light comes down from the ceiling to bath a single, jewelled\ndagger lying on a pedestal.\nThe only exit is back west.\n~\n0 D 4\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16455 28000 28001\nE\nlight , ball , white~\nWell, its a ball of fuzzy, white light.

Multifaceted rubys,\nemeralds, diamonds, opals and others glint and shine in the pure, white\nlight in the room, drawing your gaze from one horrible tempting gem\nto another.

Although built into\nthe ground beneath you, it seem more than warm and hospitable, rather \nthan the expected cold, dank, dreary hole.  From around you, the sounds of\nnature call from here and there: a lark, a small owl, even the sounds of\nsquirrels bedding down for the night.  In the sky, which you can see \npeeking out from the opening of this rabbit hole are the most brilliant\ndisplay of stars.  As you look, you almost see then dancing around the\nrabbit hole itself; in fact, they look like they are playing, waiting for\nthe residing rabbit to come join them.  They seem to beckon you to join in\ntheir games.\n \nA cool breeze blows softly around you.\n~\n0 CDKNPT 0\nS\n#17041\nBoard Room of the Creators~\nYou stand within the great Board Room of the Creators.

Here all the plans of war and repelling\ninvading forces are made. The table at the center of the room looks rather\nshaky under all the weight of food and maps. The opening to this room seems\nto be the only way out. Pictures that were obviously not drawn by orcs hang\non all the walls.

From around you, the sounds of\nnature call from here and there: a lark, a small owl, even the sounds of\nsquirrels bedding down for the night.  In the sky, which you can see \npeeking out from the opening of this rabbit hole are the most brilliant\ndisplay of stars.  As you look, you almost see then dancing around the\nrabbit hole itself; in fact, they look like they are playing, waiting for\nthe residing rabbit to come join them.

From around you, the sounds of\nnature call from here and there: a lark, a small owl, even the sounds of\nsquirrels bedding down for the night.  In the sky, which you can see \npeeking out from the opening of this rabbit hole are the most brilliant\ndisplay of stars.  As you look, you almost see then dancing around the\nrabbit hole itself; in fact, they look like they are playing, waiting for\nthe residing rabbit to come join them.  They seem to beckon you to join in\ntheir games.\n \nA cool breeze blows softly around you.\n~\n0 CDKNPT 0\nS\n#17041\nBoard Room of the Creators~\nYou stand within the great Board Room of the Creators.

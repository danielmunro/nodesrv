A wandering\nminstrel is on a chair in a corner with his lute.  A busty red headed\nwoman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk\nmen sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the\ncrowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub\nis located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy\nin a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this\nprosperous establishment.\n~\n0 DS 0\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3315\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3358\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3355\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3359\nS\n#3357\nThe Bar~\nA long mahogany bar is set in the back of the pub.

A few chairs\nand a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large\nstone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A\nlarge oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with\nwire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.\nHe looks up as you enter the room.

A wandering\nminstrel is on a chair in a corner with his lute.  A busty red headed\nwoman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk\nmen sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the\ncrowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub\nis located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy\nin a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this\nprosperous establishment.\n~\n0 DS 0\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3315\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3358\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3355\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3359\nS\n#3357\nThe Bar~\nA long mahogany bar is set in the back of the pub.

A few chairs\nand a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large\nstone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A\nlarge oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with\nwire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.\nHe looks up as you enter the room.

A wandering\nminstrel is on a chair in a corner with his lute.  A busty red headed\nwoman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk\nmen sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the\ncrowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub\nis located to your west. The bar is to the south.  A set of steps occupy\nin a corner of the room.  They lead up to the inn section of this\nprosperous establishment.\n~\n0 DS 0\nD0\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3315\nD2\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3358\nD3\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3355\nD4\nExit ~\n~\n16384 -1 3359\nS\n#3357\nThe Bar~\nA long mahogany bar is set in the back of the pub.

A few chairs\nand a couple of end tables give the room a `homey' atmosphere.  A large\nstone fireplace burns brightly against one wall and warms the room.  A\nlarge oak desk is nestled in one corner of the room.  A small man with\nwire-framed glasses sits behind the desk working dilligently on his books.\nHe looks up as you enter the room.

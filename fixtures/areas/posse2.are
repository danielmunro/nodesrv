This seems like a nice place to kick back, relax, and\nreflect on the day's battles.  Before you is a large pit.  The pit looks\nperfect for storing extra equipment or making donations to those in\nneed.

Although all the\nbedding has been thrown about the room,  this looks like a nice place to\nsleep and heal your wounds.  There are cots, beds, and bunks all over\nthe room.  Some of the Posse seem to be a bit sloppy, as there are\nclothes and bloody weapons strewn all over the place.  For some\nstrange reason there seems to be something magical about the bunk\nhouse.  It feels as if you just heal faster in here than anywhere else.\nThis room just gives you a feeling of  goodness, for some that makes\nyou feel quite at home, but for those members of the Posse that are\nmore evil, this room tends to make you queasy.\n~\n0 CDY 0\nH 300 M 300\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 31600   1 31602  1\t* the honest peddler\nG 1 3288  -1     \t*   a vial of holy water\nG 1 3238  -1     \t*   a buffalo water skin\nG 1 3239  -1     \t*   a bucket of hot Buffalo chicken wings\nG 1 3292  -1     \t*   a potion of true sight\nG 1 3291  -1     \t*   a potion of flying\nG 1 3290  -1     \t*   a potion of negation\nG 1 3289  -1     \t*   a potion of armor\nG 1 3287  -1     \t*   a potion of cure blindness\nG 1 3286  -1     \t*   a bottle of antidote\nG 1 3284  -1     \t*   a potion of cure serious wounds\nG 1 3282  -1     \t*   a potion of divine protection\nG 1 3283  -1     \t*   a potion of cure light wounds\nG 1 3281  -1     \t*   a potion of sanctuary\nG 1 3241  -1     \t*   a yellow potion of see invisible\nG 1 3242  -1     \t*   a scroll of recall\nG 1 3240  -1     \t*   a scroll of identify\nG 1 3032  -1     \t*   a bag\nO 0 31609 100 31605\t* the shimmering black wall\nO 0 31608 100 31605\t* the shimmering black wall\nO 0 31605 100 31605\t* the shimmering black wall\nO 0 31604 100 31605\t* the shimmering black wall\nO 0 31603 100 31605\t* the shimmering black wall\nO 0 31602 100 31605\t* the shimmering black wall\nO 0 31606 100 31605\t* the shimmering black wall\nO 0 31607 100 31605\t* the shimmering black wall\nO 0 31610 100 31605\t* the shimmering black wall\nD 0 31605   1 16385\t* Posse's Portal Room east\nD 0 31605   3 16384\t* Posse's Portal Room west\nD 0 31605   4 16384\t* Posse's Portal Room up\nM 0 31602   2 31601  1\t* A Posse Hall Guard\nM 0 31601   1 31601  1\t* the drunken friar\nO 0 31600 100 31601\t* the donation pit\nD 0 31601   0 16384\t* The Chateau of the Posse north\nD 0 31601   1 16384\t* The Chateau of the Posse east\nD 0 31601   2 16384\t* The Chateau of the Posse south\nD 0 31601   3 16384\t* The Chateau of the Posse west\nM 0 31602   4 31603  1\t* A Posse Hall Guard\nO 0 31611 100 31603\t* a black leather couch\nO 0 31601 100 31603\t* a fountain\nD 0 31603   3 16384\t* The Bunk House west\nD 0 31603   4 16384\t* The Bunk House up\nM 0 31603   1 31614  1\t* The hero of the Justice\nO 0 30118 100 31614\t* a black leather couch\nO 0 31601 100 31614\t* a fountain\nD 0 31614   5 16384\t* The Panic Room down\nM 0 31604   1 31600  1\t* A Posse Hall Guard\nM 0 31602   3 31600  1\t* A Posse Hall Guard\nD 0 31600   2 16384\t* The Entrance to the Chateau of the Posse south\nD 0 31600   5 24643\t* The Entrance to the Chateau of the Posse down\nS\n\n#SHOPS\n31600 10  0  0  0  0 \t 600 100 \t 0 23 \t* the honest peddler\n31603  9  5 11 33 32 \t 100  10 \t 0 23 \t* The hero of the Justice\n0\n\n#SPECIALS\nM 31601 spec_cast_adept     \t* the drunken friar\nM 31602 spec_posse_guard    \t* A Posse Hall Guard\nM 31604 spec_posse_guard    \t* A Posse Hall Guard\nS\n\n#$\n","position":16882},"values":[{"header":"SPECIALS","command":"M","id":"31601","special":"spec_cast_adept","comment":"* the drunken friar"},{"command":"M","id":"31602","special":"spec_posse_guard","comment":"* A Posse Hall Guard"},{"command":"M","id":"31604","special":"spec_posse_guard","comment":"* A Posse Hall Guard"}]}]

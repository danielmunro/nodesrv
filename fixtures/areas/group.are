You will not gain\nany experience from anything you kill until your name has been approved, \nyou therefore will not be able to level past level 4 until you speak with\nan Immortal. We regret this delay in your leveling. Have a nice Day!\n~\n\n9 LEVELNINE~\n\nNotice:  Once you have advanced beyond level 10, some of the game rules\nchange for you.  In particular, you will no longer receive automatic free\nspells from the various healers, and you won't be able to use the recall\ncommand anymore.  The only way to recall will be with deity gifts or the\n'word of recall' spell.  Be prepared!\n\nSEE: 'word of recall' 'deity'\n~\n\n10 LEVELTEN~\n\nNotice:  This is the last level at which you will be able to recall with\nthe 'recall' command, and also that last at which the healers will attend to\nyour needs for free!  Be prepared!  \n\nThe size of your equipment will also now come to bear on your gaming \nstrategy.  Armor is sized for the specific sizes of creatures, and can only\nbe made to fit via the use of the 'warp' spell.\n\nAlso, you can catch the {YPLAGUE{x if you are in a room with an infected\nMOB or player!!!\n\nSEE: 'word of recall' 'warp'\n~\n\n11 LEVELELEVEN~\n\nCongratulations!  You have gotten beyond the learning stages of MHS.  From\nthis point on, the game system will not hold your hand any longer.  You\nwill have to pay for use of the healer, you will need to warp your equipment\nto fit you, and you will need to save your sac points wisely, as the recall\ncommand will not work for you anymore.  Good luck!  If you haven't clanned\nyet but would like do, make sure you do so before level 21 or you'll never\nbe able to.\n\n~\n\n20 LEVELTWENTY~\n\nNOTICE:  This is the last level at which you will be able to join the clan\nsystem.

If you wish to enter the clan system\nyou must Loner now, or join a clan now.  Once you have used the level command, \nthere is no way to enter the clan system.  You have been warned, don't bug the immortals\nto make an exception just for you.  Once again, if you wish to join the clan system,\nLONER NOW!\n\nSEE 'clan' 'loner'\n~\n52 VFORGE~\nCreating forge is pretty simple. \nYou need at least 4 different items created before your forge can be coded \nto work. \n* Actual forge\n* At least two item parts that are placed into forge when created \n* And end product of forge. \n\nWhen you have all these items created. Write a note to coders explaining \nyour need, also mention vnums for these itemparts and endproduct so recipe \ncan be coded.  \nAfter you receive the recipe numbers from coders, you can place them into \nvalue0-4 (v0-v4) in forge (so you can have max. 5 different recipes in one \nforge). \n\nFor more complicated forging, You may request skill to be placed into \nrecipe that is taken into account when mortal forges your items. \nFor example: itempart1 and itempart2 is forged into endproduct in \nforge, if mortal has bleed skill he succeeds to create new item. But \nif anyone else but nosferatu tries to forge anything with these items, \nthey just dissolve from the forge leaving nothing behind.\n\nBelow is an example that is to be in the recipes.are file\n#22                      - recipe number\nnoskill 0                - skill and percent needed\n10741                    - vnum of the forge\n10716                    - vnum of the item to be created \n10457 15234 20764 111 0  - vnums of the components (upto five)\n\n\n~\n0 FORGE~\nUsage: forge <forge container>\n\n    Certain items in the game can be placed in a \"forge container\"\nand \"forged\" into a new item.  These items are part of a recipe that\nan Immortal has created, and may include any item(s) in the game.\nThere is a forge currently in the Armor Shop in Midgaard.\n\nThere may or may not be a skill requirement that needs to be met in\norder to forge sucessfully.  There is no way for you to know if this\nis the case.\n\nImmortals:  see the VFORGE helpfile\n~\n\n-1 GRENADE~\nSyntax: grenade <grenade> <target>\n\n   All classees are equally capable of using grenade weapons.  Different \ngrenades may or may not have different affects on their targets.  Only\ngrenade items may be thrown at your targets.  Grenades may not be used \nwhile in combat.\n~\n\n-1 ALCHEMY ALCHEMIST~\n  Alchemy is the art of creating magical potions.  Those with the Alchemist\nkit may create one of the following 6 potions.\n\n   1. Accuracy         - helps you hit things better\n   2. Magic Resistance - makes spells less likely to hurt you\n   3. Vision           - helps you see secret things, and even faded \n\t\t\t nethermancers\n   4. Restoration      - restores a small amount of magical energy\n   5. Speed            - reduces the delay on your actions\n   6. Molotov Cocktail - a weapon with which to smite your foes\n\nYou must be carrying sufficient gold to purchase the ingredients, and be\nin a magelab to make use of the alchemy skill.  The cost of the potion is \nautomatically deducted from your gold when you brew the potion.\n\nMolotov cocktails have a colour associated with them.  Each colour\nis indicative of a specific damage type.  It is up to you to determine\nwhich colours give which type of damage.\n\nSEE ALSO: grenade brew\n~\n\n-1 BREW~\nsyntax: brew <accuracy|resist|vision|mana|speed|molotov>\n\nNote: You must spell out the full name of the potion you wish to brew.\n      I.E. brew molotov NOT brew molo\n~\n\n-1 WYRMSLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-dragon\n\n    Wyrmslayers really don't like dragons.  No, you don't understand.\nThey *REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like dragons, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-lizard sentiment.  The Wyrmslayer spends his or her\nlife dedicated to the destruction of dragons, and so all Wyrmslayers are\ngiven {Cdagger{x and {Cspear{x, just to make sure they've got the tools of\nthe trade.  On top of that, Wyrmslayers are expert at getting their weapons\nthrough those damned dragon scales, and getting their spells past the\ndragon's natural magical resistance.  Due to their extreme hatred of dragons,\nthe Wyrmslayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal damage to the\nlizards.  This is not a special skill, but an inate ability that depends\nsolely on the Wyrmslayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BUFFY SLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-remort\n\n    Slayers really don't like undead.  No, you don't understand. They \n*REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like remorts, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-dead-guy sentiment.  Due to their extreme hatred \nof remorts, the Slayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal \ndamage to the undead.  This is not a special skill, but an inate \nability that depends solely on the Slayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BISHOP~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Paladin Crusader\n\n    The Bishop is a leader, and supreme spellcaster.  They do not cast\ntheir spells, they access their magic through the use of the {Choly chant{x.\nBishops receive enhanced mana gains, and have the ability to cast all of their\nspells while in combat.  Bishops also receive an extra 100 sac points, and\ncast their spells as a slight reduction in mana cost.\n\nNOTE: All Bishops should save at least two practices for 'holy chant' if \nthey wish to avoid being crippled in the spellcasting arena.\n\nSEE ALSO:  'holy chant'\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY CHANT' CHANT~\nSyntax: chant <spell> <target>\n\n    The chant command is used exactly like the 'cast' command.  The major\ndifference is that the Bishop has a skill percentage with 'chant', and  it\nis checked before he can cast a spell.  This means that Bishops have two skills\nthat must be at an adequate level: 'holy chant', and the spell being chanted.\nIt is advised that all Bishops save at least two practices for 'holy chant'\nbefore they take this kit.\n~\n\n-1 NINJA~\nAvailable to:  Thief Assassin Rogue\n\n    The ninja is the ultimate stealth machine, specializing in two unique\nabilities.  {CNinjitsu{c, and {CKurijitsu{x.  The Ninja also can sneak out \nof combat, and know which way he went.\n\nSEE ALSO: ninjitsu  kurijitsu\n~\n\n-1 NINJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Ninjitsu is the art of concealment, and adept practioners are completely\nimpossible to detect when using ninjitsu incombination with standard stealth-\nrelated skills.\n~\n\n-1 KURIJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Kurijitsu is the art of strategically placing your attacks on an   \nopponent.  Skilled practioners of kurijitsu can do incredible amounts of\ndamage with a single standard attack.  One must be very skilled in kurijitsu\nto fully realize its potential.\n~\n\n-1 PROPHET~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Monk Paladin Crusader\n\n    Of all the religious kits, the Prophet by far is the closest to his\ndeity.  Prophets are the specially chosen ones, who communicate most \nclearly and directly to their gods.  Consequently, they have the ability\nto call upon their faith to {Cimbue{x themselves with enhanced spellcasting\nabilities.  Furthermore, due to their closeness to their deities, Prophets\nreceive an extra practice any time they level.  Finally, Prophets improve\ntheir skills much more quickly than others through manual practice.\n\nSEE ALSO: imbue\n~\n\n-1 IMBUE~\nSyntax: cast 'imbue'\n\n    The 'imbue' spell is a special part of the Prophet kit, and raises the\nProphet's casting level.  The amount of the raise depends on the Prophet's\nclass.\n~\n\n-1 VINDICATOR~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Crusader\n               All races\n\n    The Vindicator is the most militant of religious figures, with a hardy\nframe, and a strong swordarm.  Vindicators are combat-oriented, and tough,\nnot to mention well atuned to the aspets of their gods that provide them  \nwith the most strength: anger.  Vindicators are the only clerics that  \nreceive the {Cthird attack{x skill, and also have the ability to cast a \nunique spell that invokes the {Cwrath{x of their gods.\n\nSEE ALSO: wrath\n~\n\n-1 WRATH~\nSyntax: cast 'wrath' <victim>\n\n\tThe spiritual Wrath of the gods can be invoked and cast upon\nanybody (barring clan/non-clan restrictions) at the will of the \nVindicator.  The spell has the potential to do enormous damage, even more\nso if used succesfully multiple times.  The lingering anger of the gods\nleaves a taint on the victim that can be used to double the damage of this\npowerful spell on the next succesful casting.  The Vindicator must be in\ngood standing with his or her deity for this spell to have its maximum\neffect.\n\n~\n\n-1 BARBARIAN~\nAvailable to:  Warrior Berzerker\n               All races\n\n   The Barbarian is a primal warrior, with brute strength and carnal\nrage as his primary offensive weapons.  Because of this, the Barbarian\nhas two special abilities, {Cendurance{x, and the powerful {Cbarbarian\nrage{x.  Both fit into the Barbarian's style of \"hurt now, ask questions\nlater, if there's anything left to interrogate.\"\n~\n\n-1 ENDURANCE~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The Endurance skill causes the barbarian to take less damage when he is \ninjured.  This includes weapon and magical damage, and it even will reduce\ndamage taken from attacks like backstabs, bites, and damage types that the\nbarbarian is vulnerable too.  The amount of reduction is random, but it can\nbe as high as 30%.\n~\n\n-1 'BARBARIAN RAGE'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The barbarian's rage is a unique type of berserk attack.  It kicks in\nautomatically.  The longer the barbarian has been in combat, the better\nthe chances are of the rage starting up.  Also, the longer the barbarian\nis in combat, the more potent the rage in when it finally does kick in.\nBecause the barbarian is a brute force combatant, he sacrafices some\nregard for personal safety while using the rage, and his AC will suffer.\n~\n\n-1 POQUAH PROWLER~\nPoquah and Prowler... Can't get much smoother than this. Now you know where\nthe 'Roxbury' social comes from.\n~\n\n-1 'KIT'~\n\nQ. What is a 'kit'?\nA. A kit is a special collection of new game mechanics and/or abilities that\nare available to specific classes.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of taking a kit?\nA. You receive special, unique abilities like new skills or spells, and you\nhave a secret card to play in the pkill game, since no one can tell what kit\nyou have.\n\nQ. What is the downside?\nA. You -must- pay practices to take a kit, there is no other way to get one.\n\nQ. Which kits are available for my class?\nA. See 'help kit list'.\n\nQ. Can I take multiple kits?\nA. Sort of.  If you take a kit, you get its skills/spells, but if you change\nkits later, you loose any of that kit's skills and special abilities.  For\nexample, if you take the 'enchanter' kit, and then later switch to another kit\nyou will loose your old enchanting abilities.\n\nQ. Can I trade my kit back in for the practices I spent on it?\nA. No.  Once you take a kit, you are irrevocably stuck with it.\n\nQ. How do I accept a kit?\nA. Type 'kit take <name>'\n\nQ. It says 'huh' when I type 'kit'!\nA. You must be at least level 10 to take a kit.\n\nQ. It says I don't have good enough attributes!\nA. Your -natural- attributes have to meet the minimum required for the kit.\n\nQ. How do I tell what the minimums are?\nA. Type 'kit info <name>'\n\nQ. If I remort, do I loose my kit?\nA. No, unless you were a remort hunter and remort :).  You will be out the\n   100 pracs.  Now, remorts CAN take a remort hunter kit, as long as the \n   kit does not hunt their type of remort.\n\nQ. If I reclass, do I loose my kit?\nA. Yes.\n\n~\n\n0 SHAMAN~\n\n   Shamans are tribal witch doctors, primitive practicioners of arcane magicks.\nTheir speciality is the practice of gradually and painfully killing their enemies.\nShamans are experts as inflicting disease upon people, and as such, are the primary\nusers of 'damage over time' spells.  Shaman DOT spells are the most powerful DOTs\nin the game, and can inflict hundreds of points of damage to a target.\n\n   Shamans have access to the 'disease' spell group, which contains four disease-\nbased DOT spells.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'damage over time' 'disease'\n~\n\n0 DISEASE~\nDisease Spell Group - Shaman Kit Only\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDamage Cap Level\n    \tLevel 18\tContagion\t\t35\n\tLevel 28\tBlight\t\t\t40\n\tLevel 38\tBoiling Blood\t\t45\n\tLevel 48\tScourge\t\t\t50\n\n\tThe four weapons of the Disease spell group.  Each does some damage when\ncast, and some recurring damage over the next few minutes.  Scourge lasts the\nlongest of these.  All of these spells have an effective level cap at which the\namount of damage they do ceases to increase with level.  Note that saving throws\nversus these spells are still done against the ACTUAL casting level of the caster.\nBut the affect caps at the above levels.  The spells cannot be cancelled.  The\nmedics of Midgaard have yet to devise a way to cure these diseases.\n\n\tAll cost 75 mana and have a 2-round delay.  Experienced victims of these\nspells have indicated that the further they get from the caster, the less damage\nthe spells do.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'shaman' 'damage over time'\n~\n\n-1 'KIT LIST'~\n\n KIT             AVAILABILTY\nAcrobat\t\tThief Rogue Assassin Monk\nAlchemist\tMage Wizard\nArcheologist    Any (except Remorts)\nBarbarian\tWarrior Berzerker\nBattlerager\tWarrior Cleric Crusader (Dwarf Only)\nBishop\t\tCleric Crusader Paladin\nBladesinger\tWarrior Blademaster Mage Wizard (Elf Only) \nBrawler  \tWarrior Thief Berzerker Samurai Rogue Blademaster\nBuffy\t\tAny (except Remorts)\nCavalier        Warrior Paladin Samurai\nEnchanter\tMage Wizard\nFence           Rogue Thief Assassin\nKnight\t\tWarrior Blademaster Cleric Paladin\nLycanthrope \n  Hunter        Any (except Remorts)\nMedium          Mage Cleric Monk Druid Elementalist Wizard Crusader\nMyrmidon\tWarrior Blademaster (except yinns)\nNature Friend\tDruid\nNecromancer     Mage Wizard\nNethermancer\tMage Wizard\nNinja\t\tThief Rogue Assassin\nProphet \tCleric Crusader Paladin Monk\nRanger\t\tWarrior Thief Rogue Blademaster\nScribe          Mage Wizard Cleric\nShaman\t\tMage Wizard Cleric Crusader\nShapeshifter\tDruid Elementalist\nSpirit Caller   Druid\nShadow Stalker  Thief Rogue\nStaff Crafter   {YDRUID{x Cleric Crusader\nSummoner\tElementalist\nVampyre Hunter  Any (Except Remorts)\nVindicator\tCleric Crusader\nWand Maker      Mage Wizard\nWarlock\t\tMage Wizard (Male Only)\nWitch\t\tMage Wizard (Female Only)\nWu Jen\t\tMage Monk Samurai\nWyrmslayer\tAny (except dragons)\n\n\nSome suggestions that you needn't bother with:\n    Do not suggest 'balance' things (\"If class X has 6 options, so should\n    class Y!\"  \"If there is a dwarf-only kit there should be a faerie-only\n    kit too!\").  Do not suggest overly specific things.  A 'knight' kit\n    would be ok.  A 'yinnish knight' or 'elven archer' or 'elf scribe' is\n    too specific.  Complaining about the availability of a given kit will not\n    get you anywhere.  Neither will complaining about the lack of kits for\n    a given race or class.

They\nare slightly more nimble than humans but a bit less hearty.  Goblins\nhave glowing red eyes and due to their awful diets are resistant\nto disease and poison.  Suprisingly they make better spellcasters \nthan they do fighters.  \n\n~\n-1 LASHER~\nLashers are a race of demonic beings. Born in heavens and cast down to seed\nfrom storms they are ill-suited to any particular class. With high strength\nand stamina they are quite resiliant so they get fast healing and meditation\nfor free and being born of the storm are resistant to the damage of lightning\nand fire. However, been cast down from the heavens they are quite vulnerable \nto the powers of light.\n~\n\n-1 DWARF DWARVES~\nDwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great\nstamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.\nThey are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long \nlifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor\nmages or thieves. \n\nDwarves are very resistant to poison, disease, and certian magics.  They\ncannot swim, and so are very vulnerable to drowning.  All dwarves receive\nberserk and sharpen regardless of class and can see in the dark with\ninfravision.\n~ \n0 DRAG~\nSyntax: drag <victim> <direction>\n        drag <object> <direction>\n\nYou can drag an object from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The object must be either\na takeable or a draggable object.\n\nYou can drag a person from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The person must be in a prone\nposition of some sort and can not be an aggressive monster.\nAnyone can drag monsters around. Only Clanners can drag\nother players around, and then only other clanners.\n~\n\n-1 DRAGON DRAGONS~\nDragons are those big scaley creatures. They may become very powerful as \nthey grow.  They have infrared vision and fly naturally.  They receive \nenhanced damage, and hand to hand combat skills for free, and naturally \ntheir breath is dangerous.  They are very costly to play in both time \nspent and experience needed as a trade off to their power. \n~\n\n-1 GARGOYLE~\nGargoyles are unliving animated stone creatures.  They are born of the\nnight, and as such, they suffer damage during the sunlight as remorts\ndo.  Gargoyles cannot escape this torment, even when indoors.  During\nthe night, Gargoyles gain resistance to some types of damage.  But\nduring the day, that resistance becomes a vulnerability.  They are\nmedium sized and can excel at any class.  They can fly, see in the\ninfrared spectrum, and have an inate ability to see invisible.\n~\n\n-1 ROCKBITER~\nRockbiters are gigantic creatures who are made of and thrive off of \nrocks and minerals.  They are the largest of all the races, and are \nthick and resiliant.  Their major weakness is that they are slow\nof movement.  Although their minds are relatively keen, they are\nprone to fall victim to mental attacks.  Although they are not very\nwise when young, they gain wisdom with age.\n~\n\n-1 FAERIES~\nFaeries are tiny little winged creatures, with great vision and perception.\nThey can all fly, see in the dark, and even detect invisible and hidden\ncreatures.  They are the best spellcasters of any of the races in terms\nof sheer magical prowess, but they have horrible strength and low hit points.\nThey are difficult to maladict, but they are incredibly agile and dodge\nbetter than any other race.  They also receive the dodge skill for free.\n~\n\n-1 MUTANTS~\nMutants are a unique race of unstable beings.  They have a natural form that\nvaguely resembles humans, but they will, at random times, mutate into other\nraces.  When they mutate, they take on the resistances, vulnerabilities,\nsize, and special characteristics of that race.  Their maximum attributes\nchange as well.  Mutants may learn skills unique to a given race, and retain\nthat knowledge long after they've changed to something else.  They have no \ncontrol over what they become.  Note that mutants will also change their CP\ndepending on what race they turn into, and will spend the overwhelming majority\nof their time with smaller CP than the mutant race naturally has.  This is not\na race for the impatient or inexperienced.  Your results will vary wildly from\nthose of other mutants.\n~\n\n-1 ELF ELVES~\nElves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They\nlack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,\nboth in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at\nbest fair talent as warriors or priests.\n\nElves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.\nBecause they are notoriously hard to spot, and so all elves, regardless of \nclass, may use sneak and hide.\n~\n\n-1 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALF~\nHalf-elves are decendents of the Elven race, yet along the way, they\nstrayed from the pure path of Elven lineage to persue true happiness\noutside their blood.  Half-elves are decendent, in majority, from\nhumans and elves.  Due to this, they are quite balanced, nearly\nexact, between the human, and that of the elf.  They have the ability\nto sneak like an elf, with their lithe bodies (if capable to do so),\nbut they have also learned to strengthen themselves, healing quickly\nas a natural ability.  They also have the ability to see in the dark\nlike their forefather elves.\n~\n\n-1 VOLARE~\nVolare are a race of angelic creatures, decended from the heavens from\nthe eyes of Mojo.

They hail from a frigid area\nof ice and storms, and so are resistant to cold and electricity.  However,\nlittle is known of their weakness, save that they do not like heat due\nto their natural climate, and area of origin.  They are a fairly intellegent\nrace, with an internal code of discipline and honor.  Even still, they have\nshort tempers, and quick swords, and do not hesitate to solve a problem\nthrough combat.  Yinn excel at most anything they do.  They are quite\nvicious.\n~\n\n-1 KENDER~\nKender are related to elves but with slightly higher strength, dexterity\nand constitution.  They lack a bit in wisdom and significantly in\nintelligence.  They are born thieves, too fidgety for other professions.\nBeing so so nimble they get the dodge skill for free and are resistant\nto being bashed.  Being so tiny they are more vulnerable to cold and\npoison.\n~\n\n-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~\nHumans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of\nadventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,\nthey are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may\nalso train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to\ngain more benefit from magical devices.\n~\n\n-1 OGRE OGRES~\nOgres are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Ogres make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nOgres resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Ogres,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only ogre warriors recive bash).\n\nThrough the years of combat,rage of fighting and pillaging, Ogres have learned\nthe scent of death.\n~\n\n-1 GIANT GIANTS~\nGiants are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nGiants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only giant warriors recive bash).\n~\n\n-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~\nMagical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the\nnecessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The\nitem skills are as follows:\n\nscrolls   The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')\nstaves    The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')\nwands   The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') \n~\n \n-1 'GROUP HEADER'~\nThe following skills and groups are available to your chacter:\n(this list may be seen again by typing list)\n{YNOTE:{x  The more skills you add, the higher your creation points will \n           be.  The higher your CP the more experience you will need to\n           level.  \n~\n\n-1 'GROUP HELP'~\nThe following commands are available:\nlist         display all groups and skills not yet bought\nlearned      show all groups and skills bought \npremise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups\nadd <name>   buy a skill or group\ndrop <name>  discard a skill or group\ninfo <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group\nhelp <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics\ndone       exit the character generation process\n~\n\n-1 'MENU CHOICE'~\nChoice (add,drop,list,help)?~\n\n-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~\nThe MHM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making\nhim or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick\nat character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are \npaid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the\nharder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to\npractice.\n\nSkill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells\nthat are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a \ndefault skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced \nselection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.\n\nThe experience breakdown is as follows: \npoints   exp/level     points   exp/level\n40        1000         90        6000\n50        1500         100       8000\n60    2000         110      12000\n70        3000         120      16000 \n80        4000         130      24000\nThe table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.\n~\n\n-1 BASICS 'MHS BASICS'~\nThe basic skills:\n\nEvery character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default\nset that all characters receive.  The default skills are:\n\nrecall    essential escape skill (see help recall)\nscrolls   reading of scrolls and other magical volumes\nstaves    use of magical staves\nwands   use of magical wands\nscan      checking who is in the area\nswimming  swimming through traverable water\n\nfor class defaults, check the classes themselves.\n~\n\n-1 DRUID DRUIDS~\nDruids specialize in the control of magic in all it's forms.  They\nbecome more powerful with age.  They may gain all the spell groups\nclerics or mages may gain as well as the special ability to control\ndefensive orbs.\n~\n\n-1 ROGUES~\nRogues are the consummate theives of Boinga.  They have access to all the same\nskills as a thief, including steal and slice, and perform these skills with\ngreater ease than does a thief.  Rogues are also extremely difficult to detect\nand are very good at sneaking and hiding.  Rogues gain hp and mana the same as\na standard thief.\n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTER~\nThe Enchanter receives no new spells or skills, but (s)he is the absolute\nfinest enchanting mage in the realm.  The enchanter not only succeeds more\noften, but has the ability to do super-enchants, that are twice as good\nas even the impression 'brilliant' enchantments.\n~\n\n-1 BRAWLER~\n\n Brawlers are practiced at fighting multiple opponents.  Even while engaged\n in combat, they can switch the focus of their attacks to somebody else.  The\n do this through use of the \"attack\" command.  They can switch to either \n another person who is fighting them, or try to draw an idle third party into\n the fight.  This ability does not override pkill ranges, clan/non-clan status,\n or kill stealing code.\n\n~\n\n-1 WU JEN 'WU JEN'~\nPractitioners of the oriental magical arts, the Wu Jen specializes in\nself enhancement.  By {Wfocus{xing their mana to cast a spell they literally\ndamage themselves to increase the strength of the spell.  They can also\ncast 'enhance' on themselves to increase their vitals temporarily.\n\nSEE ALSO: enhance, focus\n~\n\n-1 FOCUS~\nSyntax: focus 'spell' <target>\n\nFocusing the user's mana increases the power of the spell at the expense of\ndamaging the caster.\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCE~\nSyntax: cast 'enhance'\n\nThe spell randomly increases one of the caster's vital stats temporarily.\nIt also damages the caster.\n~\n\n-1 SEER~\nThe Seer kit takes advantage of high intelligence and wisdom to give\nthe ability to cast 'farsee'.  The seer must know the world of Boinga\nwell and by name to take full advantage of their gift.\n\nSEE ALSO: farsee\n~\n\n-1 FARSEE~\nSyntax: cast 'farsee' victim\n\nIf sucessful the spell reveals the name of the room that the spell's\nvictim is in.  Sometimes a failure in the sight will inform the victim\nthat someone is searching for them.  Anyone may succeed on an NPC, but\nnon-clanners will not be able to use this spell on clanners. This is a\nmental attack type.\n~\n\n-1 ACROBAT~\nThe Acrobat kit combines quick reflexes with dexterity to create an agile\nand dangerous thief.  The acrobat is difficult to hit, and difficult to \nkeep in one place for very long.  Their ability to use the {Ctumbling{x\nskill provides them with a unique ability to avoid getting hit.\n\nSEE ALSO: {Ctumbling{x\n~\n\n-1 TUMBLING~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nTumbling is a special acrobat ability.  Tumbling increases the user's\ndodging ability, as well as permits him/her to roll out of the way of \nbashes, and even roll from a bash into a standing position.\n~\n\n-1 BLADEMASTERS~\nThe Blademaster is a double-warrior reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal warrior, and can specialize in any weapon group.  The\nBlademaster is ultra-accurate with his/her weapons, and is very difficult to\ndodge, parry, or block, and almost impossible to disarm.  However, the \nBlademasters has the unique ability to disarm a weapon and catch it.  They\nalso have access to the 'dual wield' skill.\n~\n\n-1 'DUAL WIELD'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nDual wield permits a Blademaster to use two different weapons at once, \nallowing for a strategic combinatino of special flags and damage types.\nTo use dual wield, the Blademaster simply wears two seperate weapons. \nThis skill -only- works while the Blademaster has two weapons.  If his or\nher primary weapon is somehow disarmed, he/she must wear another.  The\nsecondary weapon must be either exotic, or of the same weapon group as the\noriginal.  This combined with specialization makes for a powrful fighting\ncharacter in the Blademaster.  The secondary weapon must also be lighter\nthan the primary.  Finally, it is possible to use a sword-dagger combination.\n~\n-1 CRUSADE~\nThis spell is available only to those who know the piety spell group.  It\nallows you to call upon the power of your diety to drain a targets sacrifice\npoints.

They also receive some extra spells:\n'hold person', 'endure heat' 'endure cold' 'bestow holiness' 'aid' and\n'sacred guardian'.\n~\n\n-1 SAMURAI SAMURAIS~\nSamurai are fighter mages.  They specialize in control of their body\nand using it to it's full potential.  As such they get and AC bonus on\narmor worn on body locations that normally do not receive bonuses.  They\ncan control their life energy, or 'chi', lowering their movement costs\nand they can master the art of throwing their opponent to the ground.\n~\n\n-1 MONK MONKS~\nMonks are thief clerics.  They specialize in special combat arts as well\nas issues of spirit and religion.  They are better able to defend\nthemselves and their AC is based on the weight of their armor, not it's\nstrength.  They are masters of kailindo, an anceint martial art.\n~\n\n-1 ELEMENTALIST~\n\nThe elementalist is a highly specialized mage.  Sacraficing the traditional\ntools of the trade, the elementalist has access to a handful of clerical\nspells, and an entire arsenal of new spells.  Like druids, Elementalists\ngrow in power as they age, their spells begin to have new effects and\nmore devestating results.  Their combat skills are marginal, but it is more\nthan made up for by a an impressive command of the world's natural forces.\n\nA default elementalist begins with the dagger and mace as his/her only\nweapons, and access to the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water.\nThe elements of Energy and Spirit are also available for a cost.\n\nSee also: 'element earth' 'element air' 'element fire'\n          'element water' 'element spirit' 'element energy'\n\n~\n\n-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' ~\nMages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.\nMages have the highest-powered magic of any class.  They are also very\nskilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the \nweakest of any class.\n\nAll mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be\npurchased, at a very high rate.\n\nSee 'help mage default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' ~\nClerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their\nspells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells\nbeing far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best \nclass by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of\nprotective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.\n\nAll clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must\nbe purchased, many at a very dear cost.\n\nSee 'help cleric default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' ~\nThieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,\nbut have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at\nthievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where\nmore powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than\nclerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.\n\nAll thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as \nwell.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection\nis chosen.  \n\nSee 'help thief default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' ~\nWarriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters\nof all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical\ntalents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind\ntaking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.\n\nWarriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.\nOther weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill\npackage.\n\nSee 'help warrior default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~\nEach weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how\nwell a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group\nprovides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.\nIf the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.\nThe chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at \nboth his weapon and his opponent's.\n\nThe weapon skills consist of the following:\n\nweaponsmaster skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)\naxe   the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)\ndagger    the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons\nflail   skill in ball-and-chain type weapons\nmace    this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces\npolearm   the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds\nspear   this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms\nsword   the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore\nwhip    the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips\nexotic    the use of strange magical weapons\n\nThe exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.\n~\n\n-1 ATTACK~\nThe attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy\nrather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful\nthan the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and \nthieves cannot use this group.

They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and\nconsidered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves\ndo not have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group\ncontains the following magics:\n\nmagic missile send a weak energy bolt into a foe\nchill touch weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp\nburning hands sends a blast of fire into your foe\nshocking grasp  sends a powerful jolt into a foe\nlightning bolt  sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy\ncolour spray  blasts your opponent with a rainbow spray, which may blind him\nfireball  a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes\nacid blast  sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes\nchain lightning sends lightning bolts arcing through foes \n~\n\n-1 CREATION~\nThe creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent\nduration.  Skill creators can travel without food or drink, and use their \npowers to create nourishment as required.  All classes may become learned in\nthis group, which contains these spells:\n\ncontinual light creates an eternal light source\ncreate food produces a nourishing mushroom\ncreate rose creates a beautiful red rose\ncreate spring calls forth a small but pure spring from the ground\ncreate water  fills any available container with water\nfloating disc creates a floating disc of force perfect for hauling treasure\nwarp          changes the size of armor\n~\n\n-1 CURATIVE~\nThe curative spells are used to heal various unpleasant conditions that can\nbefall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.\nCurative spells cannot be used by mages or thieves.\n\ncure blindness  restored sight to the blind\ncure disease  heals the plague\ncure poison removes the harmful effects of poison\n~\n\n-1 DETECTION~\nThe detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They\ncan be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even\nscry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors can use \ndetection spells.\n\ndetect evil reveals the aura of evil monsters\ndetect good similar to above, only for good monsters\ndetect hidden shows the whereabouts of hidden foes\ndetect invis  allows the caster to see the unseeable\ndetect magic  reveals magical auras to the caster\ndetect poison determines if food is safe to eat\nfarsight  searches for living beings near the caster\nidentify  gives information about the nature of an object\nknow alignment  determines the moral character of a monster or person\nlocate object finds a specific item\n~\n\n-1 DRACONIAN~\nThe Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, \nbringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.\nOnly mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few\nof them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.\n\nacid breath  uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy\nfire breath  calls forth the flames of a red dragon\nfrost breath   drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon\ngas breath   suffocates your enemies with poison gas\nlightning breath summons the electrical fury of a blue dragon \n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTMENT~\nThe enchantment spell group is used to imbue items with magical properties.\nCurrently, this spell group consists of enchant weapon and enchant armor, \nalthough more will be added in the future.  Only mages may enchant.\n\nenchant weapon  increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon\nenchant armor increases the protective value of armor\nfireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nrecharge  restores power to a depleted wand or staff\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCEMENT~\nThe enhancement spells improve upon the body's pontential, allowing feats of\nsuperhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful\neffects upon the recipient.\n\ngiant strength  grants increased strength\nhaste   doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing\ninfravision allows monsters to be seen in the dark\nwarp        changes the size of armor\nrefresh   restores energy to tired adventurers\n~\n\n\n-1 HARMFUL~\nThis spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed\nto tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against\nitself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.\nIn order of power, the harmful spells are:\n\ncause light inflicts minor wounds on an enemy\ncause serious inflicts wounds on a foe\ncause critical  causes major damage to the target\nharm    the most deadly harmful spell\n~\n\n-1 HEALING~\nThe healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably\nsuffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the\ncurative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.\nIn order of power, the healing spells are:\n\ncure light  heals minor wounds\nrefresh   restores vigor to a tired adventurer\ncure serious  heals wounds\ncure critical closes all but the worst wounds\nheal    the most powerful healing spell\nmass healing  casts a heal spell on each player in the room\n~\n\n-1 ILLUSION~\nThe illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be\nused to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,\nthe illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.\nOnly thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the \nfollowing:\n\ninvis   turns the target invisible\nmass invis  turns the caster's group invisible\nventriloquate allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth\n\n~\n\n-1 MALADICTIONS~\nMaladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to\ncripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells\nmay be cast by any class.\n\nfamine   causes the victim to become ravenously hungry\nblindess  strikes the target blind\ncurse   prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat\nenergy drain  drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster\nplague    causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague\npoison    weaker than plague, but often fatal\nslow    slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack  \nweaken    drains the strength of the target\n~\n\n-1 PROTECTIVE~\nThe protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or\nphysical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after\nsanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling\nhostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following \nspells:\n\narmor   provides the target with an extra layer of defense\ncancellation  a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends\ndispel magic  removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel\nfireproof shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nprotection evil provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures\nprotection good protects from the attacks of good beings\nsanctuary reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half\nshield    puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies\nstoneskin turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost\n~\n\n-1 TRANSPORTATION~\nThe transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical\nteleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,\nwhich are among the most useful in the game.\n\nfly   allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles\ngate    transports the caster to the target\nnexus   forms a two-way portal to a far off destination\npass door allows the caster to walk through walls\nportal    creates a one-way portal to a destination\nsummon    transports the target to the caster\nteleport  sends the target to a random location\nword of recall  transports the caster to safety in Midgaard\n~\n\n-1 WEATHER~\nThese spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well\nas summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is\nusable by all classes.\n\ncall lightning  summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right\ncontrol weather changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster\nfaerie fire surrounds the target in a glowing aura\nfaerie fog  reveals all hidden creatures in the room\nlightning bolt  sends a bolt of electricity into the target\n\n(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)\n~\n\n-1 BACKSTAB~\nBackstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It \ncan be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.\nThe damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his\nweapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.\n~\n\n-1 BASH~\nThe bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock\nyour foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the\nbash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon\nis not generally a wise idea.\n~\n\n-1 THROW THROWS~\nThe throw skill is a samurai talent.  In a single deft movement the samurai's\nvictim is flipped and thrown to the ground putting them into a daze.\n~\n\n-1 KAILINDO~\nAn anceint martial arts skill, kailindo is the art of blocking and striking.\n~\n\n-1 BERSERK~\nOnly powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage\nin combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge\nsurge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  \nBerserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.\n~\n\n-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~\nConsider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever \ncombatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The\nblindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity\nhelps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may\nlearn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 GAROTTE~\nThis skill is the art of choking your opponent into unconsciousness using\na wire or rope with handles on the ends as a weapon.  These weapons are\ngenerally useless for any other purpose.  Success depends on suprising the\nvictim.  This skill is available only to assassins.\n~\n\n-1 DISARM~\nDisarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your\nopponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you\nare skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves\nand warriors may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 DODGE~\nIn the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not\nbe where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the\ncharacter's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the \ntarget. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the\nattacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.\n~\n\n-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~\nWarriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are\nable to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked\nfor with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus\nis very low indeed.\n~\n\n-1 ENVENOM~\nThe envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to\nwin a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.\nOr, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.\nFood, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned\nfood or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to\nbe more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could\ndrink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on\nthe other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison \nburns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates \nquickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.\n~\n\n-1 'HAND TO HAND'~\nHand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this\nstyle of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.\nTrained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.\nClerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages\nmay also learn it.\n~\n\n-1 KICK~\nKicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful\nkick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters\nand clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn\nit.\n~\n\n-1 PARRY~\nIf at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting \nattacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for\nfull success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced\ndamage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the\ndefender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.\n~\n\n-1 RESCUE~\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with\nthe rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede\nin combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the\nfavor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as\nwell as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and\nthe target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)\n~\n\n-1 TRIP~\nBack by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves\nusing any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.\nTripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will\nfind the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.\n~\n\n-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~\nTraining in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes\nin combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every\nround.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a \nvery hard time with it.\n~\n\n-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~\nTraining in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike\nin a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect\nthird attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly\nskilled thieves may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 HIDE SNEAK~\nHide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.\nHide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the\ncharacter remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to\nsneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and\nthieves may learn these skills.\n~\n\n-1 'FAST HEALING'~\nThe fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,\nor sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general \ntoughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is \npossible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it\nvery difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.\n~\n\n-1 LORE~\nLore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use\nof the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,\nconcerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value\nof an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may\nlearn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard\nto use.\n~\n\n-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~\nHaggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to\nmatch wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,\nor to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are \nalready very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best \nguard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, \nalthough other classes may learn it as well.\n~\n\n-1 PEEK~\nThe peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,\nthe better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are\nharder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most\ncommon practicioners.\n~\n\n-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~\nLock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain\naccess to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  \nintelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may\nlearn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.\n~\n\n-1 COMMUNION~\nA skill unique to clerics, the communion skill allows the cleric to convert\nhis or her past offerings to his/her deity into hit points or mana.  The\nuse of communion is automatic, and is done when the cleric attempts to\ncast a spell without having enough mana, or is attacked and does not have\nenough hit points to survive the hit.\n~\n\n-1 MEDITATION~\nThis skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and\nmantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.\nThieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have\nmuch trouble learning to meditate.\n~\n\n-1 CHI~\nThis skill is the art of controling your life force.  When control total\ncontrol of your chi is acheived movement costs can be cut in half.\n~\n-1 'DETECT GOOD' 'DETECT EVIL'~\nSyntax: cast 'detect good'\n        cast 'detect evil' \n\t\nThese spells enable the caster to detect good and evil characters. Good \nreveals a golden aura and Evil reveals a red aura. Casting of either of\nthese spell will reveal both good and evil, it is not necessary to cast\nboth upon yourself.\n~\n\n-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~\nSyntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>\n \nDispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on \nthe pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their\nperil.\n~\n\n\n-1 'RECHARGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'recharge' <item>\n\nThe recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.\nFully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell\nis proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be\nrecharged one time successfully.\n~\n\n-1 'DEMONFIRE'~\nSyntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>\n\nDemonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those\nwho follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to \ninflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.\n~\n\n-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>\n\nRay of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth\na beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants\nof evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike \ncasters who are tainted by evil.\n~\n\n-1 'PORTAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'portal' <target>\n\nThe portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal\nto the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are\nentered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot\nbe made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.\nPortal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the\nsecret of this material component has been lost...\n~\n-1 'SHARPEN'~\nSyntax: sharpen 'weapon'\n\nSharpen is an inate ability that all dwarves know how to do.  It allows \nthem to place a sharper edge on a bladed weapon for a time.\nSharpen requires a special type of stone be used in order to work properly.\n\n                    WARNING WARNING WARNING\n\nThere is a very real chance that attempting to sharpen a weapon will \nDESTROY the weapon.  Dwarves learn with age how to avoid damaging weapons\nand causing anguish. \n~\n\n-1 'NEXUS'~\nSyntax: cast 'nexus' <target>\n\nThis spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the\nonly difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus \nspell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered\nportal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret\nof which has been lost...\n~\n\n-1 'HEAT METAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>\n\nHeat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary \naccording to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment\n(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,\ncausing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the\nprocess (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).\nThis spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY WORD'~\nSyntax: cast 'holy word'\n\nHoly word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with\ndisasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful\nblessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the\nroom are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of\nopposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)\nare struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers\ngreatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and \ndrained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.\n~\n\n-1 FRENZY~\nSyntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>\n\nThe frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing\nhis or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine\nwrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, \nmaking the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm\nspell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's \nalignment.\n~\n\n-1 CALM~\nSyntax: cast 'calm' \n\nOne of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is\nthe calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed\ncreatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage\nin combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence \nactivity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --\neither all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who\nare immune to magic) or none is.\n~\n\n-1 HASTE~\nSyntax: cast 'haste' <target>\n\nThe haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing\nan extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive\nabilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,\nsuch that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating\nthe slow spell. (see 'help slow').\n~\n\n-1 FEAST~\nSyntax: cast 'feast' <target>\n\nThe 'feast' spell is sort of like casting a magic mushroom inside of\nthe belly of your intended target.  Feast will fill up any creature, be\nit living, dead, or undead.  There are times, however, when a given\ncreature doesn't -wish- to be full.  If the victim has 'nocancel' enabled,\nhe or she will receive a saving throw versus the feast spell.\n~\n\n-1 FAMINE~\nSyntax: cast 'famine' <target>\n\nThe 'famine' spell is the antithesis of the 'feast' spell.  It drains\nsustenance from the target, leaving him or her in need of water and \nfood, or whatever else it is the victim thrives off of.  Although the\n'famine' spell is offensive, there are creatures who have a need to be\nhungry.  Hence, if you attempt to cast 'famine' on yourself, you'll always\nsucceed.\n~\n\n-1 SLOW~\nSyntax: cast 'slow' <target>\n\nDespite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell\nwith it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,\nit slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate\nof attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing\nrates, due to reduced metabolism.\n~\n\n-1 PLAGUE~\nSyntax: cast 'plague' <target>\n\nThe plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,\nsapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to\ndeath.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like\nwildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.  Willfully spreading\nplague around and among other players is generally frowned upon, and if you\ndo not take responsibility for your sickness and cure yourself, you may\nfind yourself the subject of the wrath of the immortals.\n~\n\n-1 'CREATE ROSE'~\nSyntax: cast 'create rose'\n\nA romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game\nuse whatsoever.\n~\n\n-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL' 'PROTECTION NEUTRAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>\n        cast 'protection good' <target>\n\tcast 'protection neutral' <target>\n\nThe protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate\nethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not\nbe cast on others, and one person cannot carry more then one defense at \nthe same time.\n~\n\n0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>\n \nThis spell increases the strength of the target character.\n~\n\n-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~\nSyntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>\n\nChain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning\nthat arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully\nexpended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members \nof a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other\nviable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on\ngroups of creatures.\n~\n\n-1 FARSIGHT~\nSyntax: cast 'farsight'\n  cast 'farsight' <direction>\n\nThe farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her\nto see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense\nconcentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.\nThe spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in\nall directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much\nfarther away.\n~\n\n-1 MASS HEALING~\nSyntax: cast 'mass healing' \n\nThe mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell\non all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good\nmeasure.\n~\n\n-1 'FLOATING DISC'~\nSyntax: cast 'floating disc'\n\nThis useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster\naround, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight\npenalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and\nusually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a \nmaximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location\non the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it\nto run out of energy.\n~\n\n-1 FIREPROOF~\nSyntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>\n\nThe fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,\nto protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected\nby this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.\nAlthough inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical\nfor protecting large numbers of objects.\n~\n\n-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~\nSyntax: alias\n  alias <word>\n  alias <word> <substitution>\n  unalias <word>\n\nThe alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,\naliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.\nAlias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with \nthat name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument \nproduces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new\ncommand.

They are completely\nincharge of the necromantic spells.  Players who take this kit gain one\nnew spell (wraithform) and an innate ability (vampiric touch).\nNecromancers gain bonuses for being evil when they cast necromantic \nspells. If a necromancer is not living up to their alignment expectations,\nthey suffer a penality when casting necromantic spells.\nBecause they live an evil life, their alignment will not drop\nwhen these spells are cast.\nNecromancers are also very creepy, so they do not cast beguiling spells\nvery well.  \n\nsee also:  vampiric touch\nsee also:  wraithform\n\n~\n0 WRAITHFORM~\n\nsyntax:  c 'wraithform'\n\nBy casting this spell, the necromancer is turned into a wraith like mist.\nBecause they are made of mist, they are limited in thier actions.  \nLikewise, there is very little on this world that can affect someone in\nwraithform.\nThe necromancer *MUST* leave wraithform before the duration of the spell\nhas worn out, or they will die.  All of thier material possessions will\ncross into the Netherworld.\nEntering into and leaving wraithform does require quite some time to \naccomplish.\n\nsee also: UNWRAITH or unwraith, I would really really suggest you read\n          the unwraith helpfile. -Boogums\n\n\n~\n0 UNWRAITH~\n\nsyntax:  unwraith\n\nThis is an automatic command, there is no percent or chance of failure.\nThis command takes the necromancer out of wraithform.

Write a note to coders explaining \nyour need, also mention vnums for these itemparts and endproduct so recipe \ncan be coded.  \nAfter you receive the recipe numbers from coders, you can place them into \nvalue0-4 (v0-v4) in forge (so you can have max. 5 different recipes in one \nforge). \n\nFor more complicated forging, You may request skill to be placed into \nrecipe that is taken into account when mortal forges your items. \nFor example: itempart1 and itempart2 is forged into endproduct in \nforge, if mortal has bleed skill he succeeds to create new item. But \nif anyone else but nosferatu tries to forge anything with these items, \nthey just dissolve from the forge leaving nothing behind.\n\nBelow is an example that is to be in the recipes.are file\n#22                      - recipe number\nnoskill 0                - skill and percent needed\n10741                    - vnum of the forge\n10716                    - vnum of the item to be created \n10457 15234 20764 111 0  - vnums of the components (upto five)\n\n\n~\n0 FORGE~\nUsage: forge <forge container>\n\n    Certain items in the game can be placed in a \"forge container\"\nand \"forged\" into a new item.  These items are part of a recipe that\nan Immortal has created, and may include any item(s) in the game.\nThere is a forge currently in the Armor Shop in Midgaard.\n\nThere may or may not be a skill requirement that needs to be met in\norder to forge sucessfully.  There is no way for you to know if this\nis the case.\n\nImmortals:  see the VFORGE helpfile\n~\n\n-1 GRENADE~\nSyntax: grenade <grenade> <target>\n\n   All classees are equally capable of using grenade weapons.  Different \ngrenades may or may not have different affects on their targets.  Only\ngrenade items may be thrown at your targets.  Grenades may not be used \nwhile in combat.\n~\n\n-1 ALCHEMY ALCHEMIST~\n  Alchemy is the art of creating magical potions.  Those with the Alchemist\nkit may create one of the following 6 potions.\n\n   1. Accuracy         - helps you hit things better\n   2. Magic Resistance - makes spells less likely to hurt you\n   3.

Speed            - reduces the delay on your actions\n   6. Molotov Cocktail - a weapon with which to smite your foes\n\nYou must be carrying sufficient gold to purchase the ingredients, and be\nin a magelab to make use of the alchemy skill.

No, you don't understand.\nThey *REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like dragons, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-lizard sentiment.  The Wyrmslayer spends his or her\nlife dedicated to the destruction of dragons, and so all Wyrmslayers are\ngiven {Cdagger{x and {Cspear{x, just to make sure they've got the tools of\nthe trade.  On top of that, Wyrmslayers are expert at getting their weapons\nthrough those damned dragon scales, and getting their spells past the\ndragon's natural magical resistance.  Due to their extreme hatred of dragons,\nthe Wyrmslayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal damage to the\nlizards.  This is not a special skill, but an inate ability that depends\nsolely on the Wyrmslayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BUFFY SLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-remort\n\n    Slayers really don't like undead.  No, you don't understand. They \n*REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like remorts, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-dead-guy sentiment.  Due to their extreme hatred \nof remorts, the Slayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal \ndamage to the undead.  This is not a special skill, but an inate \nability that depends solely on the Slayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BISHOP~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Paladin Crusader\n\n    The Bishop is a leader, and supreme spellcaster.  They do not cast\ntheir spells, they access their magic through the use of the {Choly chant{x.\nBishops receive enhanced mana gains, and have the ability to cast all of their\nspells while in combat.  Bishops also receive an extra 100 sac points, and\ncast their spells as a slight reduction in mana cost.\n\nNOTE: All Bishops should save at least two practices for 'holy chant' if \nthey wish to avoid being crippled in the spellcasting arena.\n\nSEE ALSO:  'holy chant'\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY CHANT' CHANT~\nSyntax: chant <spell> <target>\n\n    The chant command is used exactly like the 'cast' command.  The major\ndifference is that the Bishop has a skill percentage with 'chant', and  it\nis checked before he can cast a spell.  This means that Bishops have two skills\nthat must be at an adequate level: 'holy chant', and the spell being chanted.\nIt is advised that all Bishops save at least two practices for 'holy chant'\nbefore they take this kit.\n~\n\n-1 NINJA~\nAvailable to:  Thief Assassin Rogue\n\n    The ninja is the ultimate stealth machine, specializing in two unique\nabilities.  {CNinjitsu{c, and {CKurijitsu{x.  The Ninja also can sneak out \nof combat, and know which way he went.\n\nSEE ALSO: ninjitsu  kurijitsu\n~\n\n-1 NINJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Ninjitsu is the art of concealment, and adept practioners are completely\nimpossible to detect when using ninjitsu incombination with standard stealth-\nrelated skills.\n~\n\n-1 KURIJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Kurijitsu is the art of strategically placing your attacks on an   \nopponent.  Skilled practioners of kurijitsu can do incredible amounts of\ndamage with a single standard attack.  One must be very skilled in kurijitsu\nto fully realize its potential.\n~\n\n-1 PROPHET~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Monk Paladin Crusader\n\n    Of all the religious kits, the Prophet by far is the closest to his\ndeity.  Prophets are the specially chosen ones, who communicate most \nclearly and directly to their gods.  Consequently, they have the ability\nto call upon their faith to {Cimbue{x themselves with enhanced spellcasting\nabilities.  Furthermore, due to their closeness to their deities, Prophets\nreceive an extra practice any time they level.  Finally, Prophets improve\ntheir skills much more quickly than others through manual practice.\n\nSEE ALSO: imbue\n~\n\n-1 IMBUE~\nSyntax: cast 'imbue'\n\n    The 'imbue' spell is a special part of the Prophet kit, and raises the\nProphet's casting level.  The amount of the raise depends on the Prophet's\nclass.\n~\n\n-1 VINDICATOR~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Crusader\n               All races\n\n    The Vindicator is the most militant of religious figures, with a hardy\nframe, and a strong swordarm.  Vindicators are combat-oriented, and tough,\nnot to mention well atuned to the aspets of their gods that provide them  \nwith the most strength: anger.  Vindicators are the only clerics that  \nreceive the {Cthird attack{x skill, and also have the ability to cast a \nunique spell that invokes the {Cwrath{x of their gods.\n\nSEE ALSO: wrath\n~\n\n-1 WRATH~\nSyntax: cast 'wrath' <victim>\n\n\tThe spiritual Wrath of the gods can be invoked and cast upon\nanybody (barring clan/non-clan restrictions) at the will of the \nVindicator.  The spell has the potential to do enormous damage, even more\nso if used succesfully multiple times.  The lingering anger of the gods\nleaves a taint on the victim that can be used to double the damage of this\npowerful spell on the next succesful casting.  The Vindicator must be in\ngood standing with his or her deity for this spell to have its maximum\neffect.\n\n~\n\n-1 BARBARIAN~\nAvailable to:  Warrior Berzerker\n               All races\n\n   The Barbarian is a primal warrior, with brute strength and carnal\nrage as his primary offensive weapons.  Because of this, the Barbarian\nhas two special abilities, {Cendurance{x, and the powerful {Cbarbarian\nrage{x.  Both fit into the Barbarian's style of \"hurt now, ask questions\nlater, if there's anything left to interrogate.\"\n~\n\n-1 ENDURANCE~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The Endurance skill causes the barbarian to take less damage when he is \ninjured.  This includes weapon and magical damage, and it even will reduce\ndamage taken from attacks like backstabs, bites, and damage types that the\nbarbarian is vulnerable too.  The amount of reduction is random, but it can\nbe as high as 30%.\n~\n\n-1 'BARBARIAN RAGE'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The barbarian's rage is a unique type of berserk attack.  It kicks in\nautomatically.  The longer the barbarian has been in combat, the better\nthe chances are of the rage starting up.  Also, the longer the barbarian\nis in combat, the more potent the rage in when it finally does kick in.\nBecause the barbarian is a brute force combatant, he sacrafices some\nregard for personal safety while using the rage, and his AC will suffer.\n~\n\n-1 POQUAH PROWLER~\nPoquah and Prowler... Can't get much smoother than this. Now you know where\nthe 'Roxbury' social comes from.\n~\n\n-1 'KIT'~\n\nQ. What is a 'kit'?\nA. A kit is a special collection of new game mechanics and/or abilities that\nare available to specific classes.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of taking a kit?\nA. You receive special, unique abilities like new skills or spells, and you\nhave a secret card to play in the pkill game, since no one can tell what kit\nyou have.\n\nQ. What is the downside?\nA. You -must- pay practices to take a kit, there is no other way to get one.\n\nQ. Which kits are available for my class?\nA. See 'help kit list'.\n\nQ. Can I take multiple kits?\nA. Sort of.  If you take a kit, you get its skills/spells, but if you change\nkits later, you loose any of that kit's skills and special abilities.  For\nexample, if you take the 'enchanter' kit, and then later switch to another kit\nyou will loose your old enchanting abilities.\n\nQ. Can I trade my kit back in for the practices I spent on it?\nA. No.  Once you take a kit, you are irrevocably stuck with it.\n\nQ. How do I accept a kit?\nA. Type 'kit take <name>'\n\nQ. It says 'huh' when I type 'kit'!\nA. You must be at least level 10 to take a kit.\n\nQ. It says I don't have good enough attributes!\nA. Your -natural- attributes have to meet the minimum required for the kit.\n\nQ. How do I tell what the minimums are?\nA. Type 'kit info <name>'\n\nQ. If I remort, do I loose my kit?\nA. No, unless you were a remort hunter and remort :).  You will be out the\n   100 pracs.  Now, remorts CAN take a remort hunter kit, as long as the \n   kit does not hunt their type of remort.\n\nQ. If I reclass, do I loose my kit?\nA. Yes.\n\n~\n\n0 SHAMAN~\n\n   Shamans are tribal witch doctors, primitive practicioners of arcane magicks.\nTheir speciality is the practice of gradually and painfully killing their enemies.\nShamans are experts as inflicting disease upon people, and as such, are the primary\nusers of 'damage over time' spells.  Shaman DOT spells are the most powerful DOTs\nin the game, and can inflict hundreds of points of damage to a target.\n\n   Shamans have access to the 'disease' spell group, which contains four disease-\nbased DOT spells.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'damage over time' 'disease'\n~\n\n0 DISEASE~\nDisease Spell Group - Shaman Kit Only\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDamage Cap Level\n    \tLevel 18\tContagion\t\t35\n\tLevel 28\tBlight\t\t\t40\n\tLevel 38\tBoiling Blood\t\t45\n\tLevel 48\tScourge\t\t\t50\n\n\tThe four weapons of the Disease spell group.  Each does some damage when\ncast, and some recurring damage over the next few minutes.  Scourge lasts the\nlongest of these.  All of these spells have an effective level cap at which the\namount of damage they do ceases to increase with level.  Note that saving throws\nversus these spells are still done against the ACTUAL casting level of the caster.\nBut the affect caps at the above levels.  The spells cannot be cancelled.  The\nmedics of Midgaard have yet to devise a way to cure these diseases.\n\n\tAll cost 75 mana and have a 2-round delay.  Experienced victims of these\nspells have indicated that the further they get from the caster, the less damage\nthe spells do.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'shaman' 'damage over time'\n~\n\n-1 'KIT LIST'~\n\n KIT             AVAILABILTY\nAcrobat\t\tThief Rogue Assassin Monk\nAlchemist\tMage Wizard\nArcheologist    Any (except Remorts)\nBarbarian\tWarrior Berzerker\nBattlerager\tWarrior Cleric Crusader (Dwarf Only)\nBishop\t\tCleric Crusader Paladin\nBladesinger\tWarrior Blademaster Mage Wizard (Elf Only) \nBrawler  \tWarrior Thief Berzerker Samurai Rogue Blademaster\nBuffy\t\tAny (except Remorts)\nCavalier        Warrior Paladin Samurai\nEnchanter\tMage Wizard\nFence           Rogue Thief Assassin\nKnight\t\tWarrior Blademaster Cleric Paladin\nLycanthrope \n  Hunter        Any (except Remorts)\nMedium          Mage Cleric Monk Druid Elementalist Wizard Crusader\nMyrmidon\tWarrior Blademaster (except yinns)\nNature Friend\tDruid\nNecromancer     Mage Wizard\nNethermancer\tMage Wizard\nNinja\t\tThief Rogue Assassin\nProphet \tCleric Crusader Paladin Monk\nRanger\t\tWarrior Thief Rogue Blademaster\nScribe          Mage Wizard Cleric\nShaman\t\tMage Wizard Cleric Crusader\nShapeshifter\tDruid Elementalist\nSpirit Caller   Druid\nShadow Stalker  Thief Rogue\nStaff Crafter   {YDRUID{x Cleric Crusader\nSummoner\tElementalist\nVampyre Hunter  Any (Except Remorts)\nVindicator\tCleric Crusader\nWand Maker      Mage Wizard\nWarlock\t\tMage Wizard (Male Only)\nWitch\t\tMage Wizard (Female Only)\nWu Jen\t\tMage Monk Samurai\nWyrmslayer\tAny (except dragons)\n\n\nSome suggestions that you needn't bother with:\n    Do not suggest 'balance' things (\"If class X has 6 options, so should\n    class Y!\"  \"If there is a dwarf-only kit there should be a faerie-only\n    kit too!\").  Do not suggest overly specific things.  A 'knight' kit\n    would be ok.  A 'yinnish knight' or 'elven archer' or 'elf scribe' is\n    too specific.  Complaining about the availability of a given kit will not\n    get you anywhere.  Neither will complaining about the lack of kits for\n    a given race or class.

REMEMBER, this is something to do if you get bored at level \n51.  It is NOT intended to make you necessarily better than anyone else, \njust different.  If remorts are \"better\" then they deserve it.\n\n{WPeople who remort and have the vampyre hunter, archeologist, or \nlycanthrope hunter kit will have the kit stripped.

A Mummy\nis naturally no the best mover, so they receive less moves per level.\n\nFor more information on Remorts, see HELP REMORT.\n~\n\n-1 GOBLIN~\nGoblins are a mutant race, decended long ago from humans.  They\nare slightly more nimble than humans but a bit less hearty.  Goblins\nhave glowing red eyes and due to their awful diets are resistant\nto disease and poison.  Suprisingly they make better spellcasters \nthan they do fighters.  \n\n~\n-1 LASHER~\nLashers are a race of demonic beings. Born in heavens and cast down to seed\nfrom storms they are ill-suited to any particular class. With high strength\nand stamina they are quite resiliant so they get fast healing and meditation\nfor free and being born of the storm are resistant to the damage of lightning\nand fire. However, been cast down from the heavens they are quite vulnerable \nto the powers of light.\n~\n\n-1 DWARF DWARVES~\nDwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great\nstamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.\nThey are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long \nlifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor\nmages or thieves. \n\nDwarves are very resistant to poison, disease, and certian magics.  They\ncannot swim, and so are very vulnerable to drowning.  All dwarves receive\nberserk and sharpen regardless of class and can see in the dark with\ninfravision.\n~ \n0 DRAG~\nSyntax: drag <victim> <direction>\n        drag <object> <direction>\n\nYou can drag an object from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The object must be either\na takeable or a draggable object.\n\nYou can drag a person from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The person must be in a prone\nposition of some sort and can not be an aggressive monster.\nAnyone can drag monsters around. Only Clanners can drag\nother players around, and then only other clanners.\n~\n\n-1 DRAGON DRAGONS~\nDragons are those big scaley creatures. They may become very powerful as \nthey grow.  They have infrared vision and fly naturally.  They receive \nenhanced damage, and hand to hand combat skills for free, and naturally \ntheir breath is dangerous.  They are very costly to play in both time \nspent and experience needed as a trade off to their power. \n~\n\n-1 GARGOYLE~\nGargoyles are unliving animated stone creatures.  They are born of the\nnight, and as such, they suffer damage during the sunlight as remorts\ndo.  Gargoyles cannot escape this torment, even when indoors.  During\nthe night, Gargoyles gain resistance to some types of damage.  But\nduring the day, that resistance becomes a vulnerability.  They are\nmedium sized and can excel at any class.  They can fly, see in the\ninfrared spectrum, and have an inate ability to see invisible.\n~\n\n-1 ROCKBITER~\nRockbiters are gigantic creatures who are made of and thrive off of \nrocks and minerals.  They are the largest of all the races, and are \nthick and resiliant.  Their major weakness is that they are slow\nof movement.  Although their minds are relatively keen, they are\nprone to fall victim to mental attacks.  Although they are not very\nwise when young, they gain wisdom with age.\n~\n\n-1 FAERIES~\nFaeries are tiny little winged creatures, with great vision and perception.\nThey can all fly, see in the dark, and even detect invisible and hidden\ncreatures.  They are the best spellcasters of any of the races in terms\nof sheer magical prowess, but they have horrible strength and low hit points.\nThey are difficult to maladict, but they are incredibly agile and dodge\nbetter than any other race.  They also receive the dodge skill for free.\n~\n\n-1 MUTANTS~\nMutants are a unique race of unstable beings.  They have a natural form that\nvaguely resembles humans, but they will, at random times, mutate into other\nraces.  When they mutate, they take on the resistances, vulnerabilities,\nsize, and special characteristics of that race.  Their maximum attributes\nchange as well.  Mutants may learn skills unique to a given race, and retain\nthat knowledge long after they've changed to something else.  They have no \ncontrol over what they become.  Note that mutants will also change their CP\ndepending on what race they turn into, and will spend the overwhelming majority\nof their time with smaller CP than the mutant race naturally has.  This is not\na race for the impatient or inexperienced.  Your results will vary wildly from\nthose of other mutants.\n~\n\n-1 ELF ELVES~\nElves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They\nlack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,\nboth in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at\nbest fair talent as warriors or priests.\n\nElves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.\nBecause they are notoriously hard to spot, and so all elves, regardless of \nclass, may use sneak and hide.\n~\n\n-1 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALF~\nHalf-elves are decendents of the Elven race, yet along the way, they\nstrayed from the pure path of Elven lineage to persue true happiness\noutside their blood.  Half-elves are decendent, in majority, from\nhumans and elves.  Due to this, they are quite balanced, nearly\nexact, between the human, and that of the elf.  They have the ability\nto sneak like an elf, with their lithe bodies (if capable to do so),\nbut they have also learned to strengthen themselves, healing quickly\nas a natural ability.  They also have the ability to see in the dark\nlike their forefather elves.\n~\n\n-1 VOLARE~\nVolare are a race of angelic creatures, decended from the heavens from\nthe eyes of Mojo.  As he wept, they were created.  Volare, being good\nof nature, resist the powers of light, while are crippled by the powers\nof darkness.  With their natural abilities, they were given the nature\nto help mortals through creation, cures, and defend themselves through\ncombat.\n~\n\n-1 YINN~\n   The Yinn are a race of bipedal canines.  They hail from a frigid area\nof ice and storms, and so are resistant to cold and electricity.  However,\nlittle is known of their weakness, save that they do not like heat due\nto their natural climate, and area of origin.  They are a fairly intellegent\nrace, with an internal code of discipline and honor.  Even still, they have\nshort tempers, and quick swords, and do not hesitate to solve a problem\nthrough combat.  Yinn excel at most anything they do.  They are quite\nvicious.\n~\n\n-1 KENDER~\nKender are related to elves but with slightly higher strength, dexterity\nand constitution.  They lack a bit in wisdom and significantly in\nintelligence.  They are born thieves, too fidgety for other professions.\nBeing so so nimble they get the dodge skill for free and are resistant\nto being bashed.  Being so tiny they are more vulnerable to cold and\npoison.\n~\n\n-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~\nHumans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of\nadventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,\nthey are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may\nalso train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to\ngain more benefit from magical devices.\n~\n\n-1 OGRE OGRES~\nOgres are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Ogres make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nOgres resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Ogres,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only ogre warriors recive bash).\n\nThrough the years of combat,rage of fighting and pillaging, Ogres have learned\nthe scent of death.\n~\n\n-1 GIANT GIANTS~\nGiants are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nGiants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only giant warriors recive bash).\n~\n\n-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~\nMagical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the\nnecessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The\nitem skills are as follows:\n\nscrolls   The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')\nstaves    The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')\nwands   The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') \n~\n \n-1 'GROUP HEADER'~\nThe following skills and groups are available to your chacter:\n(this list may be seen again by typing list)\n{YNOTE:{x  The more skills you add, the higher your creation points will \n           be.  The higher your CP the more experience you will need to\n           level.  \n~\n\n-1 'GROUP HELP'~\nThe following commands are available:\nlist         display all groups and skills not yet bought\nlearned      show all groups and skills bought \npremise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups\nadd <name>   buy a skill or group\ndrop <name>  discard a skill or group\ninfo <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group\nhelp <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics\ndone       exit the character generation process\n~\n\n-1 'MENU CHOICE'~\nChoice (add,drop,list,help)?~\n\n-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~\nThe MHM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making\nhim or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick\nat character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are \npaid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the\nharder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to\npractice.\n\nSkill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells\nthat are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a \ndefault skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced \nselection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.\n\nThe experience breakdown is as follows: \npoints   exp/level     points   exp/level\n40        1000         90        6000\n50        1500         100       8000\n60    2000         110      12000\n70        3000         120      16000 \n80        4000         130      24000\nThe table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.\n~\n\n-1 BASICS 'MHS BASICS'~\nThe basic skills:\n\nEvery character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default\nset that all characters receive.  The default skills are:\n\nrecall    essential escape skill (see help recall)\nscrolls   reading of scrolls and other magical volumes\nstaves    use of magical staves\nwands   use of magical wands\nscan      checking who is in the area\nswimming  swimming through traverable water\n\nfor class defaults, check the classes themselves.\n~\n\n-1 DRUID DRUIDS~\nDruids specialize in the control of magic in all it's forms.  They\nbecome more powerful with age.  They may gain all the spell groups\nclerics or mages may gain as well as the special ability to control\ndefensive orbs.\n~\n\n-1 ROGUES~\nRogues are the consummate theives of Boinga.  They have access to all the same\nskills as a thief, including steal and slice, and perform these skills with\ngreater ease than does a thief.  Rogues are also extremely difficult to detect\nand are very good at sneaking and hiding.  Rogues gain hp and mana the same as\na standard thief.\n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTER~\nThe Enchanter receives no new spells or skills, but (s)he is the absolute\nfinest enchanting mage in the realm.  The enchanter not only succeeds more\noften, but has the ability to do super-enchants, that are twice as good\nas even the impression 'brilliant' enchantments.\n~\n\n-1 BRAWLER~\n\n Brawlers are practiced at fighting multiple opponents.  Even while engaged\n in combat, they can switch the focus of their attacks to somebody else.  The\n do this through use of the \"attack\" command.  They can switch to either \n another person who is fighting them, or try to draw an idle third party into\n the fight.  This ability does not override pkill ranges, clan/non-clan status,\n or kill stealing code.\n\n~\n\n-1 WU JEN 'WU JEN'~\nPractitioners of the oriental magical arts, the Wu Jen specializes in\nself enhancement.  By {Wfocus{xing their mana to cast a spell they literally\ndamage themselves to increase the strength of the spell.  They can also\ncast 'enhance' on themselves to increase their vitals temporarily.\n\nSEE ALSO: enhance, focus\n~\n\n-1 FOCUS~\nSyntax: focus 'spell' <target>\n\nFocusing the user's mana increases the power of the spell at the expense of\ndamaging the caster.\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCE~\nSyntax: cast 'enhance'\n\nThe spell randomly increases one of the caster's vital stats temporarily.\nIt also damages the caster.\n~\n\n-1 SEER~\nThe Seer kit takes advantage of high intelligence and wisdom to give\nthe ability to cast 'farsee'.  The seer must know the world of Boinga\nwell and by name to take full advantage of their gift.\n\nSEE ALSO: farsee\n~\n\n-1 FARSEE~\nSyntax: cast 'farsee' victim\n\nIf sucessful the spell reveals the name of the room that the spell's\nvictim is in.  Sometimes a failure in the sight will inform the victim\nthat someone is searching for them.  Anyone may succeed on an NPC, but\nnon-clanners will not be able to use this spell on clanners. This is a\nmental attack type.\n~\n\n-1 ACROBAT~\nThe Acrobat kit combines quick reflexes with dexterity to create an agile\nand dangerous thief.  The acrobat is difficult to hit, and difficult to \nkeep in one place for very long.  Their ability to use the {Ctumbling{x\nskill provides them with a unique ability to avoid getting hit.\n\nSEE ALSO: {Ctumbling{x\n~\n\n-1 TUMBLING~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nTumbling is a special acrobat ability.  Tumbling increases the user's\ndodging ability, as well as permits him/her to roll out of the way of \nbashes, and even roll from a bash into a standing position.\n~\n\n-1 BLADEMASTERS~\nThe Blademaster is a double-warrior reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal warrior, and can specialize in any weapon group.  The\nBlademaster is ultra-accurate with his/her weapons, and is very difficult to\ndodge, parry, or block, and almost impossible to disarm.  However, the \nBlademasters has the unique ability to disarm a weapon and catch it.  They\nalso have access to the 'dual wield' skill.\n~\n\n-1 'DUAL WIELD'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nDual wield permits a Blademaster to use two different weapons at once, \nallowing for a strategic combinatino of special flags and damage types.\nTo use dual wield, the Blademaster simply wears two seperate weapons. \nThis skill -only- works while the Blademaster has two weapons.  If his or\nher primary weapon is somehow disarmed, he/she must wear another.  The\nsecondary weapon must be either exotic, or of the same weapon group as the\noriginal.  This combined with specialization makes for a powrful fighting\ncharacter in the Blademaster.  The secondary weapon must also be lighter\nthan the primary.  Finally, it is possible to use a sword-dagger combination.\n~\n-1 CRUSADE~\nThis spell is available only to those who know the piety spell group.  It\nallows you to call upon the power of your diety to drain a targets sacrifice\npoints.  However, the price of doing this is not cheap, an eye for an eye\nand all...\n~\n-1 HOLY SILENCE~\nHoly Silence cuts off the targets communication with thier diety.  \n~\n-1 SEE SOUL~\nSee Soul lets you peer into the deepest depths of a person, revealing thier\nalignment and diety.\n~\n-1 INDULGENCE~\nSpell: Indulgence\nA paladin affected by indulgence will not have their alignment change\neither by killing mobs, use of necromancy spells, or use of alignment\nchanging weapons.\n~\n-1 CRUSADERS~\nCrusaders are a double-cleric  reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal cleric, and access to all the same abilities, even the\ncoveted communion skill.  They also receive some extra spells:\n'hold person', 'endure heat' 'endure cold' 'bestow holiness' 'aid' and\n'sacred guardian'.\n~\n\n-1 SAMURAI SAMURAIS~\nSamurai are fighter mages.  They specialize in control of their body\nand using it to it's full potential.  As such they get and AC bonus on\narmor worn on body locations that normally do not receive bonuses.  They\ncan control their life energy, or 'chi', lowering their movement costs\nand they can master the art of throwing their opponent to the ground.\n~\n\n-1 MONK MONKS~\nMonks are thief clerics.  They specialize in special combat arts as well\nas issues of spirit and religion.  They are better able to defend\nthemselves and their AC is based on the weight of their armor, not it's\nstrength.  They are masters of kailindo, an anceint martial art.\n~\n\n-1 ELEMENTALIST~\n\nThe elementalist is a highly specialized mage.  Sacraficing the traditional\ntools of the trade, the elementalist has access to a handful of clerical\nspells, and an entire arsenal of new spells.  Like druids, Elementalists\ngrow in power as they age, their spells begin to have new effects and\nmore devestating results.  Their combat skills are marginal, but it is more\nthan made up for by a an impressive command of the world's natural forces.\n\nA default elementalist begins with the dagger and mace as his/her only\nweapons, and access to the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water.\nThe elements of Energy and Spirit are also available for a cost.\n\nSee also: 'element earth' 'element air' 'element fire'\n          'element water' 'element spirit' 'element energy'\n\n~\n\n-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' ~\nMages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.\nMages have the highest-powered magic of any class.  They are also very\nskilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the \nweakest of any class.\n\nAll mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be\npurchased, at a very high rate.\n\nSee 'help mage default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' ~\nClerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their\nspells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells\nbeing far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best \nclass by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of\nprotective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.\n\nAll clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must\nbe purchased, many at a very dear cost.\n\nSee 'help cleric default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' ~\nThieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,\nbut have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at\nthievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where\nmore powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than\nclerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.\n\nAll thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as \nwell.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection\nis chosen.  \n\nSee 'help thief default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' ~\nWarriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters\nof all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical\ntalents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind\ntaking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.\n\nWarriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.\nOther weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill\npackage.\n\nSee 'help warrior default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~\nEach weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how\nwell a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group\nprovides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.\nIf the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.\nThe chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at \nboth his weapon and his opponent's.\n\nThe weapon skills consist of the following:\n\nweaponsmaster skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)\naxe   the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)\ndagger    the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons\nflail   skill in ball-and-chain type weapons\nmace    this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces\npolearm   the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds\nspear   this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms\nsword   the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore\nwhip    the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips\nexotic    the use of strange magical weapons\n\nThe exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.\n~\n\n-1 ATTACK~\nThe attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy\nrather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful\nthan the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and \nthieves cannot use this group.  The attack spell group consists of the \nfollowing spells:\n\ndemonfire a powerful, but very evil, spell\ndispel evil torments evil foes\ndispel good calls down unholy power on good creatures\nearthquake  brings the power of earth to bear against your foes\nflamestrike sends a column of flame from the heavens\nheat metal  heats metal equipment to searing tempatures\nray of truth  sends forth a blinding ray of holy energy\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT AIR'~\n\nElement Air is a group comprised almost entirely of unique spells.\nThis group not only controls the element of air, but influences air-\nrelated phenomena, like weather.\n\nElectricsword   - create a Shocking affect on a weapon\nElectic Shield  - protect the Elementalist from Lightning \nFly             - permits the caster to soar through the air\nDust Storm      - summons forth a cloud of blinding dust\nWall of Wind    - brings the winds to knock people over\nTraveller's Fog - a mysterious transportive spell\nAsphyxiate\t- combusts the air in the victim's lungs\nThunderclap\t- a voilent blast of noise\nMistform\t- the caster becomes insubstantial like air\n\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT EARTH'~\n\nElement Earth is composed largely of unique spells.

They are:\n\nBless              - Grants bonuses to a person or object\nCurse              - Grants negatives to a person or object\nFeast              - feed your hunger\nFamine             - cause you to be hungry\nPassdoor           - ability to walk through some doors\nSanctuary          - protective shield around the body\nWord of Recall     - return to a point of recall\n\n(Note: This group costs 15 cp as opposed to the standard 12)\n\n~\n\n\n-1 BEGUILING~\nThis insideous spell group is used to invade the minds of others.  It consists\nof various charming magics, well suited for turning your foes to your cause.\nOnly mages and thieves have access to the beguiling magics, which consist of\nthe following:\n\ncalm            if successful, stops all fighting in the room\ncharm person  turns an enemy into a trusted friend\nsleep   puts a foe into enchanted slumber\n~\n\n-1 BENEDICTIONS~\nBenedictions are priestly spells, used to bestow divine favor upon your allies.\nThey are often restricted to those of like alignment.  Only clerics and \nwarriors may use these spells.  The benedictions spell group consists of the\nfollowing:\n\nfeast   fills the belly of the intended target\nbless   bestows divine favor upon the target\ncalm    if successful, stops all fighting in the room\nfrenzy    puts the recipient into beserker rage\nholy word aids your allies while calling divine wrath upon your foes\nremove curse  removes malevolent magic from players and items\n~\n\n-1 PIETY~\nPiety are the spells of Paladins, used to smite those who are not beleivers\nof your deity.

They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and\nconsidered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves\ndo not have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group\ncontains the following magics:\n\nmagic missile send a weak energy bolt into a foe\nchill touch weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp\nburning hands sends a blast of fire into your foe\nshocking grasp  sends a powerful jolt into a foe\nlightning bolt  sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy\ncolour spray  blasts your opponent with a rainbow spray, which may blind him\nfireball  a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes\nacid blast  sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes\nchain lightning sends lightning bolts arcing through foes \n~\n\n-1 CREATION~\nThe creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent\nduration.  Skill creators can travel without food or drink, and use their \npowers to create nourishment as required.  All classes may become learned in\nthis group, which contains these spells:\n\ncontinual light creates an eternal light source\ncreate food produces a nourishing mushroom\ncreate rose creates a beautiful red rose\ncreate spring calls forth a small but pure spring from the ground\ncreate water  fills any available container with water\nfloating disc creates a floating disc of force perfect for hauling treasure\nwarp          changes the size of armor\n~\n\n-1 CURATIVE~\nThe curative spells are used to heal various unpleasant conditions that can\nbefall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.\nCurative spells cannot be used by mages or thieves.\n\ncure blindness  restored sight to the blind\ncure disease  heals the plague\ncure poison removes the harmful effects of poison\n~\n\n-1 DETECTION~\nThe detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They\ncan be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even\nscry out the true nature of your foe.

Only mages may enchant.\n\nenchant weapon  increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon\nenchant armor increases the protective value of armor\nfireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nrecharge  restores power to a depleted wand or staff\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCEMENT~\nThe enhancement spells improve upon the body's pontential, allowing feats of\nsuperhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful\neffects upon the recipient.\n\ngiant strength  grants increased strength\nhaste   doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing\ninfravision allows monsters to be seen in the dark\nwarp        changes the size of armor\nrefresh   restores energy to tired adventurers\n~\n\n\n-1 HARMFUL~\nThis spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed\nto tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against\nitself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.\nIn order of power, the harmful spells are:\n\ncause light inflicts minor wounds on an enemy\ncause serious inflicts wounds on a foe\ncause critical  causes major damage to the target\nharm    the most deadly harmful spell\n~\n\n-1 HEALING~\nThe healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably\nsuffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the\ncurative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.\nIn order of power, the healing spells are:\n\ncure light  heals minor wounds\nrefresh   restores vigor to a tired adventurer\ncure serious  heals wounds\ncure critical closes all but the worst wounds\nheal    the most powerful healing spell\nmass healing  casts a heal spell on each player in the room\n~\n\n-1 ILLUSION~\nThe illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be\nused to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,\nthe illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.\nOnly thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the \nfollowing:\n\ninvis   turns the target invisible\nmass invis  turns the caster's group invisible\nventriloquate allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth\n\n~\n\n-1 MALADICTIONS~\nMaladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to\ncripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells\nmay be cast by any class.\n\nfamine   causes the victim to become ravenously hungry\nblindess  strikes the target blind\ncurse   prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat\nenergy drain  drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster\nplague    causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague\npoison    weaker than plague, but often fatal\nslow    slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack  \nweaken    drains the strength of the target\n~\n\n-1 PROTECTIVE~\nThe protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or\nphysical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after\nsanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling\nhostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following \nspells:\n\narmor   provides the target with an extra layer of defense\ncancellation  a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends\ndispel magic  removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel\nfireproof shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nprotection evil provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures\nprotection good protects from the attacks of good beings\nsanctuary reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half\nshield    puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies\nstoneskin turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost\n~\n\n-1 TRANSPORTATION~\nThe transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical\nteleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,\nwhich are among the most useful in the game.\n\nfly   allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles\ngate    transports the caster to the target\nnexus   forms a two-way portal to a far off destination\npass door allows the caster to walk through walls\nportal    creates a one-way portal to a destination\nsummon    transports the target to the caster\nteleport  sends the target to a random location\nword of recall  transports the caster to safety in Midgaard\n~\n\n-1 WEATHER~\nThese spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well\nas summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is\nusable by all classes.\n\ncall lightning  summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right\ncontrol weather changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster\nfaerie fire surrounds the target in a glowing aura\nfaerie fog  reveals all hidden creatures in the room\nlightning bolt  sends a bolt of electricity into the target\n\n(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)\n~\n\n-1 BACKSTAB~\nBackstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It \ncan be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.\nThe damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his\nweapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.\n~\n\n-1 BASH~\nThe bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock\nyour foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the\nbash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon\nis not generally a wise idea.\n~\n\n-1 THROW THROWS~\nThe throw skill is a samurai talent.  In a single deft movement the samurai's\nvictim is flipped and thrown to the ground putting them into a daze.\n~\n\n-1 KAILINDO~\nAn anceint martial arts skill, kailindo is the art of blocking and striking.\n~\n\n-1 BERSERK~\nOnly powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage\nin combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge\nsurge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  \nBerserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.\n~\n\n-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~\nConsider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever \ncombatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The\nblindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity\nhelps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may\nlearn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 GAROTTE~\nThis skill is the art of choking your opponent into unconsciousness using\na wire or rope with handles on the ends as a weapon.  These weapons are\ngenerally useless for any other purpose.  Success depends on suprising the\nvictim.  This skill is available only to assassins.\n~\n\n-1 DISARM~\nDisarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your\nopponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you\nare skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves\nand warriors may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 DODGE~\nIn the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not\nbe where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the\ncharacter's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the \ntarget. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the\nattacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.\n~\n\n-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~\nWarriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are\nable to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked\nfor with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus\nis very low indeed.\n~\n\n-1 ENVENOM~\nThe envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to\nwin a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.\nOr, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.\nFood, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned\nfood or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to\nbe more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could\ndrink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on\nthe other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison \nburns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates \nquickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.\n~\n\n-1 'HAND TO HAND'~\nHand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this\nstyle of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.\nTrained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.\nClerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages\nmay also learn it.\n~\n\n-1 KICK~\nKicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful\nkick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters\nand clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn\nit.\n~\n\n-1 PARRY~\nIf at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting \nattacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for\nfull success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced\ndamage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the\ndefender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.\n~\n\n-1 RESCUE~\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with\nthe rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede\nin combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the\nfavor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as\nwell as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and\nthe target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)\n~\n\n-1 TRIP~\nBack by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves\nusing any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.\nTripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will\nfind the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.\n~\n\n-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~\nTraining in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes\nin combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every\nround.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a \nvery hard time with it.\n~\n\n-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~\nTraining in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike\nin a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect\nthird attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly\nskilled thieves may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 HIDE SNEAK~\nHide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.\nHide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the\ncharacter remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to\nsneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and\nthieves may learn these skills.\n~\n\n-1 'FAST HEALING'~\nThe fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,\nor sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general \ntoughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is \npossible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it\nvery difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.\n~\n\n-1 LORE~\nLore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use\nof the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,\nconcerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value\nof an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may\nlearn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard\nto use.\n~\n\n-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~\nHaggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to\nmatch wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,\nor to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are \nalready very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best \nguard his treasure closely.

Portals are\nentered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot\nbe made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.\nPortal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the\nsecret of this material component has been lost...\n~\n-1 'SHARPEN'~\nSyntax: sharpen 'weapon'\n\nSharpen is an inate ability that all dwarves know how to do.  It allows \nthem to place a sharper edge on a bladed weapon for a time.\nSharpen requires a special type of stone be used in order to work properly.\n\n                    WARNING WARNING WARNING\n\nThere is a very real chance that attempting to sharpen a weapon will \nDESTROY the weapon.  Dwarves learn with age how to avoid damaging weapons\nand causing anguish. \n~\n\n-1 'NEXUS'~\nSyntax: cast 'nexus' <target>\n\nThis spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the\nonly difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus \nspell makes a two-sided gate.

Both spells require an additional power source, the secret\nof which has been lost...\n~\n\n-1 'HEAT METAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>\n\nHeat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary \naccording to the armor of the victim.

Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.\n~\n\n-1 FRENZY~\nSyntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>\n\nThe frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing\nhis or her attack skill and damaging capacity.

Calmed\ncreatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage\nin combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence \nactivity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --\neither all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who\nare immune to magic) or none is.\n~\n\n-1 HASTE~\nSyntax: cast 'haste' <target>\n\nThe haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing\nan extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive\nabilities in combat.

If the victim has 'nocancel' enabled,\nhe or she will receive a saving throw versus the feast spell.\n~\n\n-1 FAMINE~\nSyntax: cast 'famine' <target>\n\nThe 'famine' spell is the antithesis of the 'feast' spell.  It drains\nsustenance from the target, leaving him or her in need of water and \nfood, or whatever else it is the victim thrives off of.  Although the\n'famine' spell is offensive, there are creatures who have a need to be\nhungry.  Hence, if you attempt to cast 'famine' on yourself, you'll always\nsucceed.\n~\n\n-1 SLOW~\nSyntax: cast 'slow' <target>\n\nDespite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell\nwith it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,\nit slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate\nof attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing\nrates, due to reduced metabolism.\n~\n\n-1 PLAGUE~\nSyntax: cast 'plague' <target>\n\nThe plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,\nsapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to\ndeath.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like\nwildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.

Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members \nof a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other\nviable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on\ngroups of creatures.\n~\n\n-1 FARSIGHT~\nSyntax: cast 'farsight'\n  cast 'farsight' <direction>\n\nThe farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her\nto see far away beings like they were in the same room.

It also throws in a refresh spell for good\nmeasure.\n~\n\n-1 'FLOATING DISC'~\nSyntax: cast 'floating disc'\n\nThis useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster\naround, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight\npenalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and\nusually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a \nmaximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location\non the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it\nto run out of energy.\n~\n\n-1 FIREPROOF~\nSyntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>\n\nThe fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,\nto protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected\nby this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.\nAlthough inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical\nfor protecting large numbers of objects.\n~\n\n-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~\nSyntax: alias\n  alias <word>\n  alias <word> <substitution>\n  unalias <word>\n\nThe alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,\naliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.\nAlias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with \nthat name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument \nproduces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new\ncommand.  Examples of use:\n\nalias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'\nalias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'\n\nOnly the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.\n~\n\n-1 PSIONICS~\nThe psionic group is a group of mental energy spells.\n\nThe following spells are available in the Psionics group:\n\n'psionic blast'      - does mental damage to the victim and some back to\n                       the spellcaster\n'tower of iron will' - protects the caster from mental attacks\n'body weaponry'      - turns your hands into weapons and your skin to armor\n'lay on hands'       - drains life away from the caster and gives it to\n                       the victim, can kill the caster if the victim needs\n                       more life than the caster has to give\n'mirror image'       - your opponent begins fighting something they think\n                       is you, giving you time to escape\n~\n\n-1 'PSIONIC BLAST' PSIBLAST~\nSyntax: cast 'psionic blast' <victim>\n\nA Psionic Blast will do damage to your victim based on your level,\nintelligence and constitution.

But \nif anyone else but nosferatu tries to forge anything with these items, \nthey just dissolve from the forge leaving nothing behind.\n\nBelow is an example that is to be in the recipes.are file\n#22                      - recipe number\nnoskill 0                - skill and percent needed\n10741                    - vnum of the forge\n10716                    - vnum of the item to be created \n10457 15234 20764 111 0  - vnums of the components (upto five)\n\n\n~\n0 FORGE~\nUsage: forge <forge container>\n\n    Certain items in the game can be placed in a \"forge container\"\nand \"forged\" into a new item.

No, you don't understand.\nThey *REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like dragons, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-lizard sentiment.  The Wyrmslayer spends his or her\nlife dedicated to the destruction of dragons, and so all Wyrmslayers are\ngiven {Cdagger{x and {Cspear{x, just to make sure they've got the tools of\nthe trade.  On top of that, Wyrmslayers are expert at getting their weapons\nthrough those damned dragon scales, and getting their spells past the\ndragon's natural magical resistance.  Due to their extreme hatred of dragons,\nthe Wyrmslayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal damage to the\nlizards.  This is not a special skill, but an inate ability that depends\nsolely on the Wyrmslayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BUFFY SLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-remort\n\n    Slayers really don't like undead.  No, you don't understand. They \n*REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like remorts, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-dead-guy sentiment.  Due to their extreme hatred \nof remorts, the Slayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal \ndamage to the undead.  This is not a special skill, but an inate \nability that depends solely on the Slayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BISHOP~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Paladin Crusader\n\n    The Bishop is a leader, and supreme spellcaster.  They do not cast\ntheir spells, they access their magic through the use of the {Choly chant{x.\nBishops receive enhanced mana gains, and have the ability to cast all of their\nspells while in combat.  Bishops also receive an extra 100 sac points, and\ncast their spells as a slight reduction in mana cost.\n\nNOTE: All Bishops should save at least two practices for 'holy chant' if \nthey wish to avoid being crippled in the spellcasting arena.\n\nSEE ALSO:  'holy chant'\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY CHANT' CHANT~\nSyntax: chant <spell> <target>\n\n    The chant command is used exactly like the 'cast' command.  The major\ndifference is that the Bishop has a skill percentage with 'chant', and  it\nis checked before he can cast a spell.  This means that Bishops have two skills\nthat must be at an adequate level: 'holy chant', and the spell being chanted.\nIt is advised that all Bishops save at least two practices for 'holy chant'\nbefore they take this kit.\n~\n\n-1 NINJA~\nAvailable to:  Thief Assassin Rogue\n\n    The ninja is the ultimate stealth machine, specializing in two unique\nabilities.  {CNinjitsu{c, and {CKurijitsu{x.  The Ninja also can sneak out \nof combat, and know which way he went.\n\nSEE ALSO: ninjitsu  kurijitsu\n~\n\n-1 NINJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Ninjitsu is the art of concealment, and adept practioners are completely\nimpossible to detect when using ninjitsu incombination with standard stealth-\nrelated skills.\n~\n\n-1 KURIJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Kurijitsu is the art of strategically placing your attacks on an   \nopponent.  Skilled practioners of kurijitsu can do incredible amounts of\ndamage with a single standard attack.  One must be very skilled in kurijitsu\nto fully realize its potential.\n~\n\n-1 PROPHET~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Monk Paladin Crusader\n\n    Of all the religious kits, the Prophet by far is the closest to his\ndeity.  Prophets are the specially chosen ones, who communicate most \nclearly and directly to their gods.  Consequently, they have the ability\nto call upon their faith to {Cimbue{x themselves with enhanced spellcasting\nabilities.  Furthermore, due to their closeness to their deities, Prophets\nreceive an extra practice any time they level.  Finally, Prophets improve\ntheir skills much more quickly than others through manual practice.\n\nSEE ALSO: imbue\n~\n\n-1 IMBUE~\nSyntax: cast 'imbue'\n\n    The 'imbue' spell is a special part of the Prophet kit, and raises the\nProphet's casting level.  The amount of the raise depends on the Prophet's\nclass.\n~\n\n-1 VINDICATOR~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Crusader\n               All races\n\n    The Vindicator is the most militant of religious figures, with a hardy\nframe, and a strong swordarm.  Vindicators are combat-oriented, and tough,\nnot to mention well atuned to the aspets of their gods that provide them  \nwith the most strength: anger.  Vindicators are the only clerics that  \nreceive the {Cthird attack{x skill, and also have the ability to cast a \nunique spell that invokes the {Cwrath{x of their gods.\n\nSEE ALSO: wrath\n~\n\n-1 WRATH~\nSyntax: cast 'wrath' <victim>\n\n\tThe spiritual Wrath of the gods can be invoked and cast upon\nanybody (barring clan/non-clan restrictions) at the will of the \nVindicator.  The spell has the potential to do enormous damage, even more\nso if used succesfully multiple times.  The lingering anger of the gods\nleaves a taint on the victim that can be used to double the damage of this\npowerful spell on the next succesful casting.  The Vindicator must be in\ngood standing with his or her deity for this spell to have its maximum\neffect.\n\n~\n\n-1 BARBARIAN~\nAvailable to:  Warrior Berzerker\n               All races\n\n   The Barbarian is a primal warrior, with brute strength and carnal\nrage as his primary offensive weapons.  Because of this, the Barbarian\nhas two special abilities, {Cendurance{x, and the powerful {Cbarbarian\nrage{x.  Both fit into the Barbarian's style of \"hurt now, ask questions\nlater, if there's anything left to interrogate.\"\n~\n\n-1 ENDURANCE~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The Endurance skill causes the barbarian to take less damage when he is \ninjured.  This includes weapon and magical damage, and it even will reduce\ndamage taken from attacks like backstabs, bites, and damage types that the\nbarbarian is vulnerable too.  The amount of reduction is random, but it can\nbe as high as 30%.\n~\n\n-1 'BARBARIAN RAGE'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The barbarian's rage is a unique type of berserk attack.  It kicks in\nautomatically.  The longer the barbarian has been in combat, the better\nthe chances are of the rage starting up.  Also, the longer the barbarian\nis in combat, the more potent the rage in when it finally does kick in.\nBecause the barbarian is a brute force combatant, he sacrafices some\nregard for personal safety while using the rage, and his AC will suffer.\n~\n\n-1 POQUAH PROWLER~\nPoquah and Prowler... Can't get much smoother than this. Now you know where\nthe 'Roxbury' social comes from.\n~\n\n-1 'KIT'~\n\nQ. What is a 'kit'?\nA. A kit is a special collection of new game mechanics and/or abilities that\nare available to specific classes.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of taking a kit?\nA. You receive special, unique abilities like new skills or spells, and you\nhave a secret card to play in the pkill game, since no one can tell what kit\nyou have.\n\nQ. What is the downside?\nA. You -must- pay practices to take a kit, there is no other way to get one.\n\nQ. Which kits are available for my class?\nA. See 'help kit list'.\n\nQ. Can I take multiple kits?\nA. Sort of.  If you take a kit, you get its skills/spells, but if you change\nkits later, you loose any of that kit's skills and special abilities.  For\nexample, if you take the 'enchanter' kit, and then later switch to another kit\nyou will loose your old enchanting abilities.\n\nQ. Can I trade my kit back in for the practices I spent on it?\nA. No.  Once you take a kit, you are irrevocably stuck with it.\n\nQ. How do I accept a kit?\nA. Type 'kit take <name>'\n\nQ. It says 'huh' when I type 'kit'!\nA. You must be at least level 10 to take a kit.\n\nQ. It says I don't have good enough attributes!\nA. Your -natural- attributes have to meet the minimum required for the kit.\n\nQ. How do I tell what the minimums are?\nA. Type 'kit info <name>'\n\nQ. If I remort, do I loose my kit?\nA. No, unless you were a remort hunter and remort :).  You will be out the\n   100 pracs.  Now, remorts CAN take a remort hunter kit, as long as the \n   kit does not hunt their type of remort.\n\nQ. If I reclass, do I loose my kit?\nA. Yes.\n\n~\n\n0 SHAMAN~\n\n   Shamans are tribal witch doctors, primitive practicioners of arcane magicks.\nTheir speciality is the practice of gradually and painfully killing their enemies.\nShamans are experts as inflicting disease upon people, and as such, are the primary\nusers of 'damage over time' spells.  Shaman DOT spells are the most powerful DOTs\nin the game, and can inflict hundreds of points of damage to a target.\n\n   Shamans have access to the 'disease' spell group, which contains four disease-\nbased DOT spells.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'damage over time' 'disease'\n~\n\n0 DISEASE~\nDisease Spell Group - Shaman Kit Only\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDamage Cap Level\n    \tLevel 18\tContagion\t\t35\n\tLevel 28\tBlight\t\t\t40\n\tLevel 38\tBoiling Blood\t\t45\n\tLevel 48\tScourge\t\t\t50\n\n\tThe four weapons of the Disease spell group.  Each does some damage when\ncast, and some recurring damage over the next few minutes.  Scourge lasts the\nlongest of these.  All of these spells have an effective level cap at which the\namount of damage they do ceases to increase with level.  Note that saving throws\nversus these spells are still done against the ACTUAL casting level of the caster.\nBut the affect caps at the above levels.  The spells cannot be cancelled.  The\nmedics of Midgaard have yet to devise a way to cure these diseases.\n\n\tAll cost 75 mana and have a 2-round delay.  Experienced victims of these\nspells have indicated that the further they get from the caster, the less damage\nthe spells do.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'shaman' 'damage over time'\n~\n\n-1 'KIT LIST'~\n\n KIT             AVAILABILTY\nAcrobat\t\tThief Rogue Assassin Monk\nAlchemist\tMage Wizard\nArcheologist    Any (except Remorts)\nBarbarian\tWarrior Berzerker\nBattlerager\tWarrior Cleric Crusader (Dwarf Only)\nBishop\t\tCleric Crusader Paladin\nBladesinger\tWarrior Blademaster Mage Wizard (Elf Only) \nBrawler  \tWarrior Thief Berzerker Samurai Rogue Blademaster\nBuffy\t\tAny (except Remorts)\nCavalier        Warrior Paladin Samurai\nEnchanter\tMage Wizard\nFence           Rogue Thief Assassin\nKnight\t\tWarrior Blademaster Cleric Paladin\nLycanthrope \n  Hunter        Any (except Remorts)\nMedium          Mage Cleric Monk Druid Elementalist Wizard Crusader\nMyrmidon\tWarrior Blademaster (except yinns)\nNature Friend\tDruid\nNecromancer     Mage Wizard\nNethermancer\tMage Wizard\nNinja\t\tThief Rogue Assassin\nProphet \tCleric Crusader Paladin Monk\nRanger\t\tWarrior Thief Rogue Blademaster\nScribe          Mage Wizard Cleric\nShaman\t\tMage Wizard Cleric Crusader\nShapeshifter\tDruid Elementalist\nSpirit Caller   Druid\nShadow Stalker  Thief Rogue\nStaff Crafter   {YDRUID{x Cleric Crusader\nSummoner\tElementalist\nVampyre Hunter  Any (Except Remorts)\nVindicator\tCleric Crusader\nWand Maker      Mage Wizard\nWarlock\t\tMage Wizard (Male Only)\nWitch\t\tMage Wizard (Female Only)\nWu Jen\t\tMage Monk Samurai\nWyrmslayer\tAny (except dragons)\n\n\nSome suggestions that you needn't bother with:\n    Do not suggest 'balance' things (\"If class X has 6 options, so should\n    class Y!\"  \"If there is a dwarf-only kit there should be a faerie-only\n    kit too!\").

To become a remort type: remort <selection> picking one of the \nvalid remorts.  You will then be transformed and forced to quit out \nof the game.  REMEMBER, this is something to do if you get bored at level \n51.  It is NOT intended to make you necessarily better than anyone else, \njust different.  If remorts are \"better\" then they deserve it.\n\n{WPeople who remort and have the vampyre hunter, archeologist, or \nlycanthrope hunter kit will have the kit stripped.  You will be out \n100 pracs.\n{x\nWhen you come back, all remorts will have the following affects:\nYou will be level 25.\nYou will have lost 26 levels of experience.\nIf you did not use all your trains you will be forced to train\nhitpoints, then...

You\nwill be more vulnerable to weapons made of a certain material. A Mummy\nis naturally no the best mover, so they receive less moves per level.\n\nFor more information on Remorts, see HELP REMORT.\n~\n\n-1 GOBLIN~\nGoblins are a mutant race, decended long ago from humans.  They\nare slightly more nimble than humans but a bit less hearty.  Goblins\nhave glowing red eyes and due to their awful diets are resistant\nto disease and poison.  Suprisingly they make better spellcasters \nthan they do fighters.  \n\n~\n-1 LASHER~\nLashers are a race of demonic beings. Born in heavens and cast down to seed\nfrom storms they are ill-suited to any particular class. With high strength\nand stamina they are quite resiliant so they get fast healing and meditation\nfor free and being born of the storm are resistant to the damage of lightning\nand fire. However, been cast down from the heavens they are quite vulnerable \nto the powers of light.\n~\n\n-1 DWARF DWARVES~\nDwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great\nstamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.\nThey are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long \nlifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor\nmages or thieves. \n\nDwarves are very resistant to poison, disease, and certian magics.  They\ncannot swim, and so are very vulnerable to drowning.  All dwarves receive\nberserk and sharpen regardless of class and can see in the dark with\ninfravision.\n~ \n0 DRAG~\nSyntax: drag <victim> <direction>\n        drag <object> <direction>\n\nYou can drag an object from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The object must be either\na takeable or a draggable object.\n\nYou can drag a person from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The person must be in a prone\nposition of some sort and can not be an aggressive monster.\nAnyone can drag monsters around. Only Clanners can drag\nother players around, and then only other clanners.\n~\n\n-1 DRAGON DRAGONS~\nDragons are those big scaley creatures. They may become very powerful as \nthey grow.  They have infrared vision and fly naturally.  They receive \nenhanced damage, and hand to hand combat skills for free, and naturally \ntheir breath is dangerous.  They are very costly to play in both time \nspent and experience needed as a trade off to their power. \n~\n\n-1 GARGOYLE~\nGargoyles are unliving animated stone creatures.  They are born of the\nnight, and as such, they suffer damage during the sunlight as remorts\ndo.  Gargoyles cannot escape this torment, even when indoors.  During\nthe night, Gargoyles gain resistance to some types of damage.  But\nduring the day, that resistance becomes a vulnerability.  They are\nmedium sized and can excel at any class.  They can fly, see in the\ninfrared spectrum, and have an inate ability to see invisible.\n~\n\n-1 ROCKBITER~\nRockbiters are gigantic creatures who are made of and thrive off of \nrocks and minerals.  They are the largest of all the races, and are \nthick and resiliant.  Their major weakness is that they are slow\nof movement.  Although their minds are relatively keen, they are\nprone to fall victim to mental attacks.  Although they are not very\nwise when young, they gain wisdom with age.\n~\n\n-1 FAERIES~\nFaeries are tiny little winged creatures, with great vision and perception.\nThey can all fly, see in the dark, and even detect invisible and hidden\ncreatures.  They are the best spellcasters of any of the races in terms\nof sheer magical prowess, but they have horrible strength and low hit points.\nThey are difficult to maladict, but they are incredibly agile and dodge\nbetter than any other race.  They also receive the dodge skill for free.\n~\n\n-1 MUTANTS~\nMutants are a unique race of unstable beings.  They have a natural form that\nvaguely resembles humans, but they will, at random times, mutate into other\nraces.  When they mutate, they take on the resistances, vulnerabilities,\nsize, and special characteristics of that race.  Their maximum attributes\nchange as well.  Mutants may learn skills unique to a given race, and retain\nthat knowledge long after they've changed to something else.  They have no \ncontrol over what they become.  Note that mutants will also change their CP\ndepending on what race they turn into, and will spend the overwhelming majority\nof their time with smaller CP than the mutant race naturally has.  This is not\na race for the impatient or inexperienced.  Your results will vary wildly from\nthose of other mutants.\n~\n\n-1 ELF ELVES~\nElves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They\nlack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,\nboth in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at\nbest fair talent as warriors or priests.\n\nElves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.\nBecause they are notoriously hard to spot, and so all elves, regardless of \nclass, may use sneak and hide.\n~\n\n-1 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALF~\nHalf-elves are decendents of the Elven race, yet along the way, they\nstrayed from the pure path of Elven lineage to persue true happiness\noutside their blood.  Half-elves are decendent, in majority, from\nhumans and elves.  Due to this, they are quite balanced, nearly\nexact, between the human, and that of the elf.  They have the ability\nto sneak like an elf, with their lithe bodies (if capable to do so),\nbut they have also learned to strengthen themselves, healing quickly\nas a natural ability.  They also have the ability to see in the dark\nlike their forefather elves.\n~\n\n-1 VOLARE~\nVolare are a race of angelic creatures, decended from the heavens from\nthe eyes of Mojo.  As he wept, they were created.  Volare, being good\nof nature, resist the powers of light, while are crippled by the powers\nof darkness.  With their natural abilities, they were given the nature\nto help mortals through creation, cures, and defend themselves through\ncombat.\n~\n\n-1 YINN~\n   The Yinn are a race of bipedal canines.  They hail from a frigid area\nof ice and storms, and so are resistant to cold and electricity.  However,\nlittle is known of their weakness, save that they do not like heat due\nto their natural climate, and area of origin.  They are a fairly intellegent\nrace, with an internal code of discipline and honor.  Even still, they have\nshort tempers, and quick swords, and do not hesitate to solve a problem\nthrough combat.  Yinn excel at most anything they do.  They are quite\nvicious.\n~\n\n-1 KENDER~\nKender are related to elves but with slightly higher strength, dexterity\nand constitution.  They lack a bit in wisdom and significantly in\nintelligence.  They are born thieves, too fidgety for other professions.\nBeing so so nimble they get the dodge skill for free and are resistant\nto being bashed.  Being so tiny they are more vulnerable to cold and\npoison.\n~\n\n-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~\nHumans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of\nadventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,\nthey are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may\nalso train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to\ngain more benefit from magical devices.\n~\n\n-1 OGRE OGRES~\nOgres are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Ogres make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nOgres resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Ogres,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only ogre warriors recive bash).\n\nThrough the years of combat,rage of fighting and pillaging, Ogres have learned\nthe scent of death.\n~\n\n-1 GIANT GIANTS~\nGiants are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nGiants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only giant warriors recive bash).\n~\n\n-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~\nMagical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the\nnecessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The\nitem skills are as follows:\n\nscrolls   The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')\nstaves    The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')\nwands   The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') \n~\n \n-1 'GROUP HEADER'~\nThe following skills and groups are available to your chacter:\n(this list may be seen again by typing list)\n{YNOTE:{x  The more skills you add, the higher your creation points will \n           be.  The higher your CP the more experience you will need to\n           level.  \n~\n\n-1 'GROUP HELP'~\nThe following commands are available:\nlist         display all groups and skills not yet bought\nlearned      show all groups and skills bought \npremise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups\nadd <name>   buy a skill or group\ndrop <name>  discard a skill or group\ninfo <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group\nhelp <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics\ndone       exit the character generation process\n~\n\n-1 'MENU CHOICE'~\nChoice (add,drop,list,help)?~\n\n-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~\nThe MHM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making\nhim or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick\nat character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are \npaid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the\nharder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to\npractice.\n\nSkill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells\nthat are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a \ndefault skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced \nselection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.\n\nThe experience breakdown is as follows: \npoints   exp/level     points   exp/level\n40        1000         90        6000\n50        1500         100       8000\n60    2000         110      12000\n70        3000         120      16000 \n80        4000         130      24000\nThe table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.\n~\n\n-1 BASICS 'MHS BASICS'~\nThe basic skills:\n\nEvery character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default\nset that all characters receive.  The default skills are:\n\nrecall    essential escape skill (see help recall)\nscrolls   reading of scrolls and other magical volumes\nstaves    use of magical staves\nwands   use of magical wands\nscan      checking who is in the area\nswimming  swimming through traverable water\n\nfor class defaults, check the classes themselves.\n~\n\n-1 DRUID DRUIDS~\nDruids specialize in the control of magic in all it's forms.  They\nbecome more powerful with age.  They may gain all the spell groups\nclerics or mages may gain as well as the special ability to control\ndefensive orbs.\n~\n\n-1 ROGUES~\nRogues are the consummate theives of Boinga.  They have access to all the same\nskills as a thief, including steal and slice, and perform these skills with\ngreater ease than does a thief.  Rogues are also extremely difficult to detect\nand are very good at sneaking and hiding.  Rogues gain hp and mana the same as\na standard thief.\n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTER~\nThe Enchanter receives no new spells or skills, but (s)he is the absolute\nfinest enchanting mage in the realm.  The enchanter not only succeeds more\noften, but has the ability to do super-enchants, that are twice as good\nas even the impression 'brilliant' enchantments.\n~\n\n-1 BRAWLER~\n\n Brawlers are practiced at fighting multiple opponents.  Even while engaged\n in combat, they can switch the focus of their attacks to somebody else.  The\n do this through use of the \"attack\" command.  They can switch to either \n another person who is fighting them, or try to draw an idle third party into\n the fight.  This ability does not override pkill ranges, clan/non-clan status,\n or kill stealing code.\n\n~\n\n-1 WU JEN 'WU JEN'~\nPractitioners of the oriental magical arts, the Wu Jen specializes in\nself enhancement.  By {Wfocus{xing their mana to cast a spell they literally\ndamage themselves to increase the strength of the spell.  They can also\ncast 'enhance' on themselves to increase their vitals temporarily.\n\nSEE ALSO: enhance, focus\n~\n\n-1 FOCUS~\nSyntax: focus 'spell' <target>\n\nFocusing the user's mana increases the power of the spell at the expense of\ndamaging the caster.\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCE~\nSyntax: cast 'enhance'\n\nThe spell randomly increases one of the caster's vital stats temporarily.\nIt also damages the caster.\n~\n\n-1 SEER~\nThe Seer kit takes advantage of high intelligence and wisdom to give\nthe ability to cast 'farsee'.  The seer must know the world of Boinga\nwell and by name to take full advantage of their gift.\n\nSEE ALSO: farsee\n~\n\n-1 FARSEE~\nSyntax: cast 'farsee' victim\n\nIf sucessful the spell reveals the name of the room that the spell's\nvictim is in.  Sometimes a failure in the sight will inform the victim\nthat someone is searching for them.  Anyone may succeed on an NPC, but\nnon-clanners will not be able to use this spell on clanners. This is a\nmental attack type.\n~\n\n-1 ACROBAT~\nThe Acrobat kit combines quick reflexes with dexterity to create an agile\nand dangerous thief.  The acrobat is difficult to hit, and difficult to \nkeep in one place for very long.  Their ability to use the {Ctumbling{x\nskill provides them with a unique ability to avoid getting hit.\n\nSEE ALSO: {Ctumbling{x\n~\n\n-1 TUMBLING~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nTumbling is a special acrobat ability.  Tumbling increases the user's\ndodging ability, as well as permits him/her to roll out of the way of \nbashes, and even roll from a bash into a standing position.\n~\n\n-1 BLADEMASTERS~\nThe Blademaster is a double-warrior reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal warrior, and can specialize in any weapon group.  The\nBlademaster is ultra-accurate with his/her weapons, and is very difficult to\ndodge, parry, or block, and almost impossible to disarm.  However, the \nBlademasters has the unique ability to disarm a weapon and catch it.  They\nalso have access to the 'dual wield' skill.\n~\n\n-1 'DUAL WIELD'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nDual wield permits a Blademaster to use two different weapons at once, \nallowing for a strategic combinatino of special flags and damage types.\nTo use dual wield, the Blademaster simply wears two seperate weapons. \nThis skill -only- works while the Blademaster has two weapons.  If his or\nher primary weapon is somehow disarmed, he/she must wear another.  The\nsecondary weapon must be either exotic, or of the same weapon group as the\noriginal.  This combined with specialization makes for a powrful fighting\ncharacter in the Blademaster.  The secondary weapon must also be lighter\nthan the primary.  Finally, it is possible to use a sword-dagger combination.\n~\n-1 CRUSADE~\nThis spell is available only to those who know the piety spell group.  It\nallows you to call upon the power of your diety to drain a targets sacrifice\npoints.  However, the price of doing this is not cheap, an eye for an eye\nand all...\n~\n-1 HOLY SILENCE~\nHoly Silence cuts off the targets communication with thier diety.  \n~\n-1 SEE SOUL~\nSee Soul lets you peer into the deepest depths of a person, revealing thier\nalignment and diety.\n~\n-1 INDULGENCE~\nSpell: Indulgence\nA paladin affected by indulgence will not have their alignment change\neither by killing mobs, use of necromancy spells, or use of alignment\nchanging weapons.\n~\n-1 CRUSADERS~\nCrusaders are a double-cleric  reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal cleric, and access to all the same abilities, even the\ncoveted communion skill.  They also receive some extra spells:\n'hold person', 'endure heat' 'endure cold' 'bestow holiness' 'aid' and\n'sacred guardian'.\n~\n\n-1 SAMURAI SAMURAIS~\nSamurai are fighter mages.  They specialize in control of their body\nand using it to it's full potential.  As such they get and AC bonus on\narmor worn on body locations that normally do not receive bonuses.  They\ncan control their life energy, or 'chi', lowering their movement costs\nand they can master the art of throwing their opponent to the ground.\n~\n\n-1 MONK MONKS~\nMonks are thief clerics.  They specialize in special combat arts as well\nas issues of spirit and religion.  They are better able to defend\nthemselves and their AC is based on the weight of their armor, not it's\nstrength.  They are masters of kailindo, an anceint martial art.\n~\n\n-1 ELEMENTALIST~\n\nThe elementalist is a highly specialized mage.  Sacraficing the traditional\ntools of the trade, the elementalist has access to a handful of clerical\nspells, and an entire arsenal of new spells.  Like druids, Elementalists\ngrow in power as they age, their spells begin to have new effects and\nmore devestating results.  Their combat skills are marginal, but it is more\nthan made up for by a an impressive command of the world's natural forces.\n\nA default elementalist begins with the dagger and mace as his/her only\nweapons, and access to the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water.\nThe elements of Energy and Spirit are also available for a cost.\n\nSee also: 'element earth' 'element air' 'element fire'\n          'element water' 'element spirit' 'element energy'\n\n~\n\n-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' ~\nMages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.\nMages have the highest-powered magic of any class.  They are also very\nskilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the \nweakest of any class.\n\nAll mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be\npurchased, at a very high rate.\n\nSee 'help mage default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' ~\nClerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their\nspells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells\nbeing far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best \nclass by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of\nprotective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.\n\nAll clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must\nbe purchased, many at a very dear cost.\n\nSee 'help cleric default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' ~\nThieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,\nbut have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at\nthievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where\nmore powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than\nclerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.\n\nAll thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as \nwell.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection\nis chosen.  \n\nSee 'help thief default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' ~\nWarriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters\nof all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical\ntalents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind\ntaking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.\n\nWarriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.\nOther weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill\npackage.\n\nSee 'help warrior default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~\nEach weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how\nwell a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group\nprovides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.\nIf the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.\nThe chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at \nboth his weapon and his opponent's.\n\nThe weapon skills consist of the following:\n\nweaponsmaster skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)\naxe   the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)\ndagger    the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons\nflail   skill in ball-and-chain type weapons\nmace    this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces\npolearm   the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds\nspear   this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms\nsword   the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore\nwhip    the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips\nexotic    the use of strange magical weapons\n\nThe exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.\n~\n\n-1 ATTACK~\nThe attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy\nrather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful\nthan the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and \nthieves cannot use this group.  The attack spell group consists of the \nfollowing spells:\n\ndemonfire a powerful, but very evil, spell\ndispel evil torments evil foes\ndispel good calls down unholy power on good creatures\nearthquake  brings the power of earth to bear against your foes\nflamestrike sends a column of flame from the heavens\nheat metal  heats metal equipment to searing tempatures\nray of truth  sends forth a blinding ray of holy energy\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT AIR'~\n\nElement Air is a group comprised almost entirely of unique spells.\nThis group not only controls the element of air, but influences air-\nrelated phenomena, like weather.\n\nElectricsword   - create a Shocking affect on a weapon\nElectic Shield  - protect the Elementalist from Lightning \nFly             - permits the caster to soar through the air\nDust Storm      - summons forth a cloud of blinding dust\nWall of Wind    - brings the winds to knock people over\nTraveller's Fog - a mysterious transportive spell\nAsphyxiate\t- combusts the air in the victim's lungs\nThunderclap\t- a voilent blast of noise\nMistform\t- the caster becomes insubstantial like air\n\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT EARTH'~\n\nElement Earth is composed largely of unique spells.  It has command over\nnot just the earth, but the materials that are the bones of the earth,\nsuch as stone and metal.\n\nEarthquake\t- inflict damage on those in the room \nStoneskin\t- turns the character's flesh to stone\nEarthbind\t- binds the victim's feet to the ground\nStonefist\t- gives the caster a stone grip on his weapons\nRust Armor\t- turns metal armor to rust\nRust Weapon\t- can ruin even enchanted weapons\nBody of Stone\t- increases the caster's constitution\n\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT FIRE'~\n\nElement Fire is composed entirely of overlap spells, and affects\nheat and heat-related radiation as well as fire.\n\nBurning Hands      - inflict damage upon a victim\nContinual Light    - create a ball of light or make an object visible\nFaerie Fire        - make a victim easier to hit\nFireball           - inflict damage upon a victim\nFireproof          - increase an objects resistance to fire\nFlamesword         - create a Flaming affect on a weapon\nFlame Shield       - protect the Elementalist from Fire\nHeat Metal         - cause a victim to drop objects\nInfravision        - ability to see in the dark\n\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT WATER'~\n\nElement water influences all aspects of water and precipitation.\nIt has some overlap spells and some unique spells.\n\nCreate Water   \t- fills your container with water\nCreate Spring\t- brings forth a fresh spring of water\nFrostsword      - create a Frost affect on a weapon\nFrost Shield    - protect the Elementalist from Ice \nRefresh\t\t- restores the water in your body, giving you stamina\nTsunami\t\t- creates a towering wall of water\nWater Breathing\t- lets your lungs breathe water as well as air\nIce Storm\t- invokes a furious storm of ice upon your enemies \n\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT ENERGY'~\n\nElement Energy is a powerful branch of the elementalist tree.\nIt contains some overlap spells, as well as some unique elemental\nspells.\n\nChain lightning    - an arcing bolt of electricity\nCall lightning     - summons a single, powerful lightning strike\nLightning bolt     - creates a minor bolt of electricity\nShocking grasp\t   - a touch attack that uses static electricity\nIrradiate\t   - sickens the victim with debilitating radiation\nCreate node\t   - creates an energy node where the caster stands\nVisit node\t   - brings the caster to one of his nodes\n\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT SPIRIT'~\n\nElement Spirit contains all overlap spells that are vital to the\nelementalist's survival.  They are:\n\nBless              - Grants bonuses to a person or object\nCurse              - Grants negatives to a person or object\nFeast              - feed your hunger\nFamine             - cause you to be hungry\nPassdoor           - ability to walk through some doors\nSanctuary          - protective shield around the body\nWord of Recall     - return to a point of recall\n\n(Note: This group costs 15 cp as opposed to the standard 12)\n\n~\n\n\n-1 BEGUILING~\nThis insideous spell group is used to invade the minds of others.  It consists\nof various charming magics, well suited for turning your foes to your cause.\nOnly mages and thieves have access to the beguiling magics, which consist of\nthe following:\n\ncalm            if successful, stops all fighting in the room\ncharm person  turns an enemy into a trusted friend\nsleep   puts a foe into enchanted slumber\n~\n\n-1 BENEDICTIONS~\nBenedictions are priestly spells, used to bestow divine favor upon your allies.\nThey are often restricted to those of like alignment.  Only clerics and \nwarriors may use these spells.  The benedictions spell group consists of the\nfollowing:\n\nfeast   fills the belly of the intended target\nbless   bestows divine favor upon the target\ncalm    if successful, stops all fighting in the room\nfrenzy    puts the recipient into beserker rage\nholy word aids your allies while calling divine wrath upon your foes\nremove curse  removes malevolent magic from players and items\n~\n\n-1 PIETY~\nPiety are the spells of Paladins, used to smite those who are not beleivers\nof your deity.  The piety spell group consists of:\n\nbless  bestows divine favor upon the target\ncurse  leaves the victim without divine assistance\ncrusade  at a cost to your sacrifices lowers the value of target's sacrifices\nholy silence  cuts off all in the room's communication with their deity\nsee soul  know the alignment and deity of the target\nindulgence  your alignment will not change due to your actions\n~\n\n-1 COMBAT~\nThese sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to\ntoss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and\nconsidered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves\ndo not have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group\ncontains the following magics:\n\nmagic missile send a weak energy bolt into a foe\nchill touch weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp\nburning hands sends a blast of fire into your foe\nshocking grasp  sends a powerful jolt into a foe\nlightning bolt  sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy\ncolour spray  blasts your opponent with a rainbow spray, which may blind him\nfireball  a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes\nacid blast  sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes\nchain lightning sends lightning bolts arcing through foes \n~\n\n-1 CREATION~\nThe creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent\nduration.  Skill creators can travel without food or drink, and use their \npowers to create nourishment as required.  All classes may become learned in\nthis group, which contains these spells:\n\ncontinual light creates an eternal light source\ncreate food produces a nourishing mushroom\ncreate rose creates a beautiful red rose\ncreate spring calls forth a small but pure spring from the ground\ncreate water  fills any available container with water\nfloating disc creates a floating disc of force perfect for hauling treasure\nwarp          changes the size of armor\n~\n\n-1 CURATIVE~\nThe curative spells are used to heal various unpleasant conditions that can\nbefall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.\nCurative spells cannot be used by mages or thieves.\n\ncure blindness  restored sight to the blind\ncure disease  heals the plague\ncure poison removes the harmful effects of poison\n~\n\n-1 DETECTION~\nThe detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They\ncan be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even\nscry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors can use \ndetection spells.\n\ndetect evil reveals the aura of evil monsters\ndetect good similar to above, only for good monsters\ndetect hidden shows the whereabouts of hidden foes\ndetect invis  allows the caster to see the unseeable\ndetect magic  reveals magical auras to the caster\ndetect poison determines if food is safe to eat\nfarsight  searches for living beings near the caster\nidentify  gives information about the nature of an object\nknow alignment  determines the moral character of a monster or person\nlocate object finds a specific item\n~\n\n-1 DRACONIAN~\nThe Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, \nbringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.\nOnly mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few\nof them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.\n\nacid breath  uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy\nfire breath  calls forth the flames of a red dragon\nfrost breath   drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon\ngas breath   suffocates your enemies with poison gas\nlightning breath summons the electrical fury of a blue dragon \n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTMENT~\nThe enchantment spell group is used to imbue items with magical properties.\nCurrently, this spell group consists of enchant weapon and enchant armor, \nalthough more will be added in the future.  Only mages may enchant.\n\nenchant weapon  increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon\nenchant armor increases the protective value of armor\nfireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nrecharge  restores power to a depleted wand or staff\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCEMENT~\nThe enhancement spells improve upon the body's pontential, allowing feats of\nsuperhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful\neffects upon the recipient.\n\ngiant strength  grants increased strength\nhaste   doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing\ninfravision allows monsters to be seen in the dark\nwarp        changes the size of armor\nrefresh   restores energy to tired adventurers\n~\n\n\n-1 HARMFUL~\nThis spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed\nto tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against\nitself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.\nIn order of power, the harmful spells are:\n\ncause light inflicts minor wounds on an enemy\ncause serious inflicts wounds on a foe\ncause critical  causes major damage to the target\nharm    the most deadly harmful spell\n~\n\n-1 HEALING~\nThe healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably\nsuffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the\ncurative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.\nIn order of power, the healing spells are:\n\ncure light  heals minor wounds\nrefresh   restores vigor to a tired adventurer\ncure serious  heals wounds\ncure critical closes all but the worst wounds\nheal    the most powerful healing spell\nmass healing  casts a heal spell on each player in the room\n~\n\n-1 ILLUSION~\nThe illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be\nused to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,\nthe illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.\nOnly thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the \nfollowing:\n\ninvis   turns the target invisible\nmass invis  turns the caster's group invisible\nventriloquate allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth\n\n~\n\n-1 MALADICTIONS~\nMaladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to\ncripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells\nmay be cast by any class.\n\nfamine   causes the victim to become ravenously hungry\nblindess  strikes the target blind\ncurse   prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat\nenergy drain  drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster\nplague    causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague\npoison    weaker than plague, but often fatal\nslow    slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack  \nweaken    drains the strength of the target\n~\n\n-1 PROTECTIVE~\nThe protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or\nphysical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after\nsanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling\nhostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following \nspells:\n\narmor   provides the target with an extra layer of defense\ncancellation  a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends\ndispel magic  removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel\nfireproof shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nprotection evil provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures\nprotection good protects from the attacks of good beings\nsanctuary reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half\nshield    puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies\nstoneskin turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost\n~\n\n-1 TRANSPORTATION~\nThe transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical\nteleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,\nwhich are among the most useful in the game.\n\nfly   allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles\ngate    transports the caster to the target\nnexus   forms a two-way portal to a far off destination\npass door allows the caster to walk through walls\nportal    creates a one-way portal to a destination\nsummon    transports the target to the caster\nteleport  sends the target to a random location\nword of recall  transports the caster to safety in Midgaard\n~\n\n-1 WEATHER~\nThese spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well\nas summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is\nusable by all classes.\n\ncall lightning  summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right\ncontrol weather changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster\nfaerie fire surrounds the target in a glowing aura\nfaerie fog  reveals all hidden creatures in the room\nlightning bolt  sends a bolt of electricity into the target\n\n(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)\n~\n\n-1 BACKSTAB~\nBackstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It \ncan be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.\nThe damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his\nweapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.\n~\n\n-1 BASH~\nThe bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock\nyour foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the\nbash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon\nis not generally a wise idea.\n~\n\n-1 THROW THROWS~\nThe throw skill is a samurai talent.  In a single deft movement the samurai's\nvictim is flipped and thrown to the ground putting them into a daze.\n~\n\n-1 KAILINDO~\nAn anceint martial arts skill, kailindo is the art of blocking and striking.\n~\n\n-1 BERSERK~\nOnly powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage\nin combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge\nsurge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  \nBerserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.\n~\n\n-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~\nConsider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever \ncombatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The\nblindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity\nhelps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may\nlearn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 GAROTTE~\nThis skill is the art of choking your opponent into unconsciousness using\na wire or rope with handles on the ends as a weapon.  These weapons are\ngenerally useless for any other purpose.  Success depends on suprising the\nvictim.  This skill is available only to assassins.\n~\n\n-1 DISARM~\nDisarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your\nopponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you\nare skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves\nand warriors may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 DODGE~\nIn the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not\nbe where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the\ncharacter's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the \ntarget. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the\nattacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.\n~\n\n-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~\nWarriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are\nable to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked\nfor with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus\nis very low indeed.\n~\n\n-1 ENVENOM~\nThe envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to\nwin a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.\nOr, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.\nFood, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned\nfood or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to\nbe more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could\ndrink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on\nthe other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison \nburns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates \nquickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.\n~\n\n-1 'HAND TO HAND'~\nHand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this\nstyle of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.\nTrained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.\nClerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages\nmay also learn it.\n~\n\n-1 KICK~\nKicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful\nkick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters\nand clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn\nit.\n~\n\n-1 PARRY~\nIf at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting \nattacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for\nfull success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced\ndamage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the\ndefender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.\n~\n\n-1 RESCUE~\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with\nthe rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede\nin combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the\nfavor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as\nwell as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and\nthe target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)\n~\n\n-1 TRIP~\nBack by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves\nusing any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.\nTripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will\nfind the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.\n~\n\n-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~\nTraining in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes\nin combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every\nround.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a \nvery hard time with it.\n~\n\n-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~\nTraining in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike\nin a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect\nthird attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly\nskilled thieves may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 HIDE SNEAK~\nHide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.\nHide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the\ncharacter remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to\nsneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and\nthieves may learn these skills.\n~\n\n-1 'FAST HEALING'~\nThe fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,\nor sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general \ntoughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is \npossible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it\nvery difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.\n~\n\n-1 LORE~\nLore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use\nof the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,\nconcerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value\nof an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may\nlearn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard\nto use.\n~\n\n-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~\nHaggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to\nmatch wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,\nor to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are \nalready very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best \nguard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, \nalthough other classes may learn it as well.\n~\n\n-1 PEEK~\nThe peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,\nthe better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are\nharder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most\ncommon practicioners.\n~\n\n-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~\nLock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain\naccess to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  \nintelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may\nlearn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.\n~\n\n-1 COMMUNION~\nA skill unique to clerics, the communion skill allows the cleric to convert\nhis or her past offerings to his/her deity into hit points or mana.  The\nuse of communion is automatic, and is done when the cleric attempts to\ncast a spell without having enough mana, or is attacked and does not have\nenough hit points to survive the hit.\n~\n\n-1 MEDITATION~\nThis skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and\nmantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.\nThieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have\nmuch trouble learning to meditate.\n~\n\n-1 CHI~\nThis skill is the art of controling your life force.  When control total\ncontrol of your chi is acheived movement costs can be cut in half.\n~\n-1 'DETECT GOOD' 'DETECT EVIL'~\nSyntax: cast 'detect good'\n        cast 'detect evil' \n\t\nThese spells enable the caster to detect good and evil characters. Good \nreveals a golden aura and Evil reveals a red aura. Casting of either of\nthese spell will reveal both good and evil, it is not necessary to cast\nboth upon yourself.\n~\n\n-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~\nSyntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>\n \nDispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on \nthe pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their\nperil.\n~\n\n\n-1 'RECHARGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'recharge' <item>\n\nThe recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.\nFully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell\nis proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be\nrecharged one time successfully.\n~\n\n-1 'DEMONFIRE'~\nSyntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>\n\nDemonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those\nwho follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to \ninflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.\n~\n\n-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>\n\nRay of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth\na beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants\nof evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike \ncasters who are tainted by evil.\n~\n\n-1 'PORTAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'portal' <target>\n\nThe portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal\nto the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are\nentered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot\nbe made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.\nPortal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the\nsecret of this material component has been lost...\n~\n-1 'SHARPEN'~\nSyntax: sharpen 'weapon'\n\nSharpen is an inate ability that all dwarves know how to do.  It allows \nthem to place a sharper edge on a bladed weapon for a time.\nSharpen requires a special type of stone be used in order to work properly.\n\n                    WARNING WARNING WARNING\n\nThere is a very real chance that attempting to sharpen a weapon will \nDESTROY the weapon.  Dwarves learn with age how to avoid damaging weapons\nand causing anguish. \n~\n\n-1 'NEXUS'~\nSyntax: cast 'nexus' <target>\n\nThis spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the\nonly difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus \nspell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered\nportal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret\nof which has been lost...\n~\n\n-1 'HEAT METAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>\n\nHeat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary \naccording to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment\n(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,\ncausing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the\nprocess (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).\nThis spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY WORD'~\nSyntax: cast 'holy word'\n\nHoly word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with\ndisasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful\nblessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the\nroom are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of\nopposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)\nare struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers\ngreatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and \ndrained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.\n~\n\n-1 FRENZY~\nSyntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>\n\nThe frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing\nhis or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine\nwrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, \nmaking the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm\nspell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's \nalignment.\n~\n\n-1 CALM~\nSyntax: cast 'calm' \n\nOne of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is\nthe calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed\ncreatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage\nin combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence \nactivity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --\neither all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who\nare immune to magic) or none is.\n~\n\n-1 HASTE~\nSyntax: cast 'haste' <target>\n\nThe haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing\nan extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive\nabilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,\nsuch that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating\nthe slow spell. (see 'help slow').\n~\n\n-1 FEAST~\nSyntax: cast 'feast' <target>\n\nThe 'feast' spell is sort of like casting a magic mushroom inside of\nthe belly of your intended target.  Feast will fill up any creature, be\nit living, dead, or undead.  There are times, however, when a given\ncreature doesn't -wish- to be full.  If the victim has 'nocancel' enabled,\nhe or she will receive a saving throw versus the feast spell.\n~\n\n-1 FAMINE~\nSyntax: cast 'famine' <target>\n\nThe 'famine' spell is the antithesis of the 'feast' spell.  It drains\nsustenance from the target, leaving him or her in need of water and \nfood, or whatever else it is the victim thrives off of.  Although the\n'famine' spell is offensive, there are creatures who have a need to be\nhungry.  Hence, if you attempt to cast 'famine' on yourself, you'll always\nsucceed.\n~\n\n-1 SLOW~\nSyntax: cast 'slow' <target>\n\nDespite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell\nwith it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,\nit slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate\nof attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing\nrates, due to reduced metabolism.\n~\n\n-1 PLAGUE~\nSyntax: cast 'plague' <target>\n\nThe plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,\nsapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to\ndeath.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like\nwildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.  Willfully spreading\nplague around and among other players is generally frowned upon, and if you\ndo not take responsibility for your sickness and cure yourself, you may\nfind yourself the subject of the wrath of the immortals.\n~\n\n-1 'CREATE ROSE'~\nSyntax: cast 'create rose'\n\nA romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game\nuse whatsoever.\n~\n\n-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL' 'PROTECTION NEUTRAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>\n        cast 'protection good' <target>\n\tcast 'protection neutral' <target>\n\nThe protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate\nethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not\nbe cast on others, and one person cannot carry more then one defense at \nthe same time.\n~\n\n0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>\n \nThis spell increases the strength of the target character.\n~\n\n-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~\nSyntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>\n\nChain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning\nthat arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully\nexpended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members \nof a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other\nviable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on\ngroups of creatures.\n~\n\n-1 FARSIGHT~\nSyntax: cast 'farsight'\n  cast 'farsight' <direction>\n\nThe farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her\nto see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense\nconcentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.\nThe spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in\nall directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much\nfarther away.\n~\n\n-1 MASS HEALING~\nSyntax: cast 'mass healing' \n\nThe mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell\non all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good\nmeasure.\n~\n\n-1 'FLOATING DISC'~\nSyntax: cast 'floating disc'\n\nThis useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster\naround, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight\npenalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and\nusually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a \nmaximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location\non the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it\nto run out of energy.\n~\n\n-1 FIREPROOF~\nSyntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>\n\nThe fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,\nto protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected\nby this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.\nAlthough inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical\nfor protecting large numbers of objects.\n~\n\n-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~\nSyntax: alias\n  alias <word>\n  alias <word> <substitution>\n  unalias <word>\n\nThe alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,\naliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.\nAlias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with \nthat name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument \nproduces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new\ncommand.  Examples of use:\n\nalias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'\nalias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'\n\nOnly the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.\n~\n\n-1 PSIONICS~\nThe psionic group is a group of mental energy spells.\n\nThe following spells are available in the Psionics group:\n\n'psionic blast'      - does mental damage to the victim and some back to\n                       the spellcaster\n'tower of iron will' - protects the caster from mental attacks\n'body weaponry'      - turns your hands into weapons and your skin to armor\n'lay on hands'       - drains life away from the caster and gives it to\n                       the victim, can kill the caster if the victim needs\n                       more life than the caster has to give\n'mirror image'       - your opponent begins fighting something they think\n                       is you, giving you time to escape\n~\n\n-1 'PSIONIC BLAST' PSIBLAST~\nSyntax: cast 'psionic blast' <victim>\n\nA Psionic Blast will do damage to your victim based on your level,\nintelligence and constitution.  It will also do a fraction of that\ndamage back to you.\n~\n\n-1 'TOWER OF IRON WILL'~\nSyntax: cast 'tower of iron will'\n\nOnce protected by the Tower of Iron Will the caster becomes resistant\nto mental attacks.\n~\n\n-1 'BODY WEAPONRY'~\nSyntax: cast 'body weaponry' <target>\n\nOnce affected by Body Weaponry your hands become magical weapons when \nfighting un-armed and your skin becomes magical armor.\n~\n\n-1 'LAY ON HANDS'~\nSyntax: cast 'lay on hands' <target>\n\nYou lay your hands on another and your life force flows into them.\nIf the one you are giving life to needs more than you have to give\nyou may become mortally wounded.\n~\n\n-1 'MIRROR IMAGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'mirror image'\n\nYour opponent begins fighting something they believe to be you giving\nyou a chance to escape, or...\n~\n\n-1 'BESTOW HOLINESS'~\nSyntax: cast 'bestow holiness' <object>\n\nThis Crusader spell is designed with the favored of the gods in mind.\nThe Crusader can imbue a normal weapon with the holiness of the gods,\nmaking that weapon the perfect selection of any Paladin.\nThere is a chance that a weapon can be given the holy flag permanently.\nHowever, when this happens, there is also a chance that the weapon will\nevaporate.\n\n~\n\n-1 'HOLD PERSON'~\nSyntax: cast 'hold person' <victim>\n\nBringing down the wrath of the gods, the Crusader can stop his\nopponent from moving with this spell.  The victim is prevented from\nwalking anywhere and is unable to use his or her skills,spells or\nabilities. If the held person is attacked, the spell fails.\n~\n\n-1 'ENDURE HEAT' 'ENDURE COLD'~\nSyntax: cast 'endure <heat|cold>' <target>\n\nThis spell, castable only by Crusaders, blesses the target with\nresistance to cold- or heat-based attacks.  It only works on creatures\nthat do not already have sort of innate resistance or vulnerability to\nthese attacks.  It won't, for exmaple, work on a dragon to counter their\nvulnerability to cold.\n~\n\n-1 'AID'~\nSyntax: cast 'aid' <target>\n\nThe Crusader can temporarily increase his or her maximum hit points, or\nthose of a companion through the use of the aid spell.

On top of that, Wyrmslayers are expert at getting their weapons\nthrough those damned dragon scales, and getting their spells past the\ndragon's natural magical resistance.  Due to their extreme hatred of dragons,\nthe Wyrmslayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal damage to the\nlizards.  This is not a special skill, but an inate ability that depends\nsolely on the Wyrmslayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BUFFY SLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-remort\n\n    Slayers really don't like undead.  No, you don't understand. They \n*REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like remorts, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-dead-guy sentiment.  Due to their extreme hatred \nof remorts, the Slayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal \ndamage to the undead.  This is not a special skill, but an inate \nability that depends solely on the Slayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BISHOP~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Paladin Crusader\n\n    The Bishop is a leader, and supreme spellcaster.  They do not cast\ntheir spells, they access their magic through the use of the {Choly chant{x.\nBishops receive enhanced mana gains, and have the ability to cast all of their\nspells while in combat.  Bishops also receive an extra 100 sac points, and\ncast their spells as a slight reduction in mana cost.\n\nNOTE: All Bishops should save at least two practices for 'holy chant' if \nthey wish to avoid being crippled in the spellcasting arena.\n\nSEE ALSO:  'holy chant'\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY CHANT' CHANT~\nSyntax: chant <spell> <target>\n\n    The chant command is used exactly like the 'cast' command.  The major\ndifference is that the Bishop has a skill percentage with 'chant', and  it\nis checked before he can cast a spell.  This means that Bishops have two skills\nthat must be at an adequate level: 'holy chant', and the spell being chanted.\nIt is advised that all Bishops save at least two practices for 'holy chant'\nbefore they take this kit.\n~\n\n-1 NINJA~\nAvailable to:  Thief Assassin Rogue\n\n    The ninja is the ultimate stealth machine, specializing in two unique\nabilities.  {CNinjitsu{c, and {CKurijitsu{x.  The Ninja also can sneak out \nof combat, and know which way he went.\n\nSEE ALSO: ninjitsu  kurijitsu\n~\n\n-1 NINJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Ninjitsu is the art of concealment, and adept practioners are completely\nimpossible to detect when using ninjitsu incombination with standard stealth-\nrelated skills.\n~\n\n-1 KURIJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Kurijitsu is the art of strategically placing your attacks on an   \nopponent.  Skilled practioners of kurijitsu can do incredible amounts of\ndamage with a single standard attack.  One must be very skilled in kurijitsu\nto fully realize its potential.\n~\n\n-1 PROPHET~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Monk Paladin Crusader\n\n    Of all the religious kits, the Prophet by far is the closest to his\ndeity.  Prophets are the specially chosen ones, who communicate most \nclearly and directly to their gods.  Consequently, they have the ability\nto call upon their faith to {Cimbue{x themselves with enhanced spellcasting\nabilities.  Furthermore, due to their closeness to their deities, Prophets\nreceive an extra practice any time they level.  Finally, Prophets improve\ntheir skills much more quickly than others through manual practice.\n\nSEE ALSO: imbue\n~\n\n-1 IMBUE~\nSyntax: cast 'imbue'\n\n    The 'imbue' spell is a special part of the Prophet kit, and raises the\nProphet's casting level.  The amount of the raise depends on the Prophet's\nclass.\n~\n\n-1 VINDICATOR~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Crusader\n               All races\n\n    The Vindicator is the most militant of religious figures, with a hardy\nframe, and a strong swordarm.  Vindicators are combat-oriented, and tough,\nnot to mention well atuned to the aspets of their gods that provide them  \nwith the most strength: anger.  Vindicators are the only clerics that  \nreceive the {Cthird attack{x skill, and also have the ability to cast a \nunique spell that invokes the {Cwrath{x of their gods.\n\nSEE ALSO: wrath\n~\n\n-1 WRATH~\nSyntax: cast 'wrath' <victim>\n\n\tThe spiritual Wrath of the gods can be invoked and cast upon\nanybody (barring clan/non-clan restrictions) at the will of the \nVindicator.  The spell has the potential to do enormous damage, even more\nso if used succesfully multiple times.  The lingering anger of the gods\nleaves a taint on the victim that can be used to double the damage of this\npowerful spell on the next succesful casting.  The Vindicator must be in\ngood standing with his or her deity for this spell to have its maximum\neffect.\n\n~\n\n-1 BARBARIAN~\nAvailable to:  Warrior Berzerker\n               All races\n\n   The Barbarian is a primal warrior, with brute strength and carnal\nrage as his primary offensive weapons.  Because of this, the Barbarian\nhas two special abilities, {Cendurance{x, and the powerful {Cbarbarian\nrage{x.  Both fit into the Barbarian's style of \"hurt now, ask questions\nlater, if there's anything left to interrogate.\"\n~\n\n-1 ENDURANCE~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The Endurance skill causes the barbarian to take less damage when he is \ninjured.  This includes weapon and magical damage, and it even will reduce\ndamage taken from attacks like backstabs, bites, and damage types that the\nbarbarian is vulnerable too.  The amount of reduction is random, but it can\nbe as high as 30%.\n~\n\n-1 'BARBARIAN RAGE'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The barbarian's rage is a unique type of berserk attack.  It kicks in\nautomatically.  The longer the barbarian has been in combat, the better\nthe chances are of the rage starting up.  Also, the longer the barbarian\nis in combat, the more potent the rage in when it finally does kick in.\nBecause the barbarian is a brute force combatant, he sacrafices some\nregard for personal safety while using the rage, and his AC will suffer.\n~\n\n-1 POQUAH PROWLER~\nPoquah and Prowler... Can't get much smoother than this. Now you know where\nthe 'Roxbury' social comes from.\n~\n\n-1 'KIT'~\n\nQ. What is a 'kit'?\nA. A kit is a special collection of new game mechanics and/or abilities that\nare available to specific classes.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of taking a kit?\nA. You receive special, unique abilities like new skills or spells, and you\nhave a secret card to play in the pkill game, since no one can tell what kit\nyou have.\n\nQ. What is the downside?\nA. You -must- pay practices to take a kit, there is no other way to get one.\n\nQ. Which kits are available for my class?\nA. See 'help kit list'.\n\nQ. Can I take multiple kits?\nA. Sort of.  If you take a kit, you get its skills/spells, but if you change\nkits later, you loose any of that kit's skills and special abilities.  For\nexample, if you take the 'enchanter' kit, and then later switch to another kit\nyou will loose your old enchanting abilities.\n\nQ. Can I trade my kit back in for the practices I spent on it?\nA. No.  Once you take a kit, you are irrevocably stuck with it.\n\nQ. How do I accept a kit?\nA. Type 'kit take <name>'\n\nQ. It says 'huh' when I type 'kit'!\nA. You must be at least level 10 to take a kit.\n\nQ. It says I don't have good enough attributes!\nA. Your -natural- attributes have to meet the minimum required for the kit.\n\nQ. How do I tell what the minimums are?\nA. Type 'kit info <name>'\n\nQ. If I remort, do I loose my kit?\nA. No, unless you were a remort hunter and remort :).  You will be out the\n   100 pracs.  Now, remorts CAN take a remort hunter kit, as long as the \n   kit does not hunt their type of remort.\n\nQ. If I reclass, do I loose my kit?\nA. Yes.\n\n~\n\n0 SHAMAN~\n\n   Shamans are tribal witch doctors, primitive practicioners of arcane magicks.\nTheir speciality is the practice of gradually and painfully killing their enemies.\nShamans are experts as inflicting disease upon people, and as such, are the primary\nusers of 'damage over time' spells.  Shaman DOT spells are the most powerful DOTs\nin the game, and can inflict hundreds of points of damage to a target.\n\n   Shamans have access to the 'disease' spell group, which contains four disease-\nbased DOT spells.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'damage over time' 'disease'\n~\n\n0 DISEASE~\nDisease Spell Group - Shaman Kit Only\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDamage Cap Level\n    \tLevel 18\tContagion\t\t35\n\tLevel 28\tBlight\t\t\t40\n\tLevel 38\tBoiling Blood\t\t45\n\tLevel 48\tScourge\t\t\t50\n\n\tThe four weapons of the Disease spell group.  Each does some damage when\ncast, and some recurring damage over the next few minutes.  Scourge lasts the\nlongest of these.  All of these spells have an effective level cap at which the\namount of damage they do ceases to increase with level.  Note that saving throws\nversus these spells are still done against the ACTUAL casting level of the caster.\nBut the affect caps at the above levels.  The spells cannot be cancelled.  The\nmedics of Midgaard have yet to devise a way to cure these diseases.\n\n\tAll cost 75 mana and have a 2-round delay.  Experienced victims of these\nspells have indicated that the further they get from the caster, the less damage\nthe spells do.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'shaman' 'damage over time'\n~\n\n-1 'KIT LIST'~\n\n KIT             AVAILABILTY\nAcrobat\t\tThief Rogue Assassin Monk\nAlchemist\tMage Wizard\nArcheologist    Any (except Remorts)\nBarbarian\tWarrior Berzerker\nBattlerager\tWarrior Cleric Crusader (Dwarf Only)\nBishop\t\tCleric Crusader Paladin\nBladesinger\tWarrior Blademaster Mage Wizard (Elf Only) \nBrawler  \tWarrior Thief Berzerker Samurai Rogue Blademaster\nBuffy\t\tAny (except Remorts)\nCavalier        Warrior Paladin Samurai\nEnchanter\tMage Wizard\nFence           Rogue Thief Assassin\nKnight\t\tWarrior Blademaster Cleric Paladin\nLycanthrope \n  Hunter        Any (except Remorts)\nMedium          Mage Cleric Monk Druid Elementalist Wizard Crusader\nMyrmidon\tWarrior Blademaster (except yinns)\nNature Friend\tDruid\nNecromancer     Mage Wizard\nNethermancer\tMage Wizard\nNinja\t\tThief Rogue Assassin\nProphet \tCleric Crusader Paladin Monk\nRanger\t\tWarrior Thief Rogue Blademaster\nScribe          Mage Wizard Cleric\nShaman\t\tMage Wizard Cleric Crusader\nShapeshifter\tDruid Elementalist\nSpirit Caller   Druid\nShadow Stalker  Thief Rogue\nStaff Crafter   {YDRUID{x Cleric Crusader\nSummoner\tElementalist\nVampyre Hunter  Any (Except Remorts)\nVindicator\tCleric Crusader\nWand Maker      Mage Wizard\nWarlock\t\tMage Wizard (Male Only)\nWitch\t\tMage Wizard (Female Only)\nWu Jen\t\tMage Monk Samurai\nWyrmslayer\tAny (except dragons)\n\n\nSome suggestions that you needn't bother with:\n    Do not suggest 'balance' things (\"If class X has 6 options, so should\n    class Y!\"  \"If there is a dwarf-only kit there should be a faerie-only\n    kit too!\").  Do not suggest overly specific things.  A 'knight' kit\n    would be ok.  A 'yinnish knight' or 'elven archer' or 'elf scribe' is\n    too specific.  Complaining about the availability of a given kit will not\n    get you anywhere.  Neither will complaining about the lack of kits for\n    a given race or class.

A Mummy\nis naturally no the best mover, so they receive less moves per level.\n\nFor more information on Remorts, see HELP REMORT.\n~\n\n-1 GOBLIN~\nGoblins are a mutant race, decended long ago from humans.  They\nare slightly more nimble than humans but a bit less hearty.  Goblins\nhave glowing red eyes and due to their awful diets are resistant\nto disease and poison.  Suprisingly they make better spellcasters \nthan they do fighters.  \n\n~\n-1 LASHER~\nLashers are a race of demonic beings. Born in heavens and cast down to seed\nfrom storms they are ill-suited to any particular class. With high strength\nand stamina they are quite resiliant so they get fast healing and meditation\nfor free and being born of the storm are resistant to the damage of lightning\nand fire. However, been cast down from the heavens they are quite vulnerable \nto the powers of light.\n~\n\n-1 DWARF DWARVES~\nDwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great\nstamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.\nThey are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long \nlifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor\nmages or thieves. \n\nDwarves are very resistant to poison, disease, and certian magics.  They\ncannot swim, and so are very vulnerable to drowning.  All dwarves receive\nberserk and sharpen regardless of class and can see in the dark with\ninfravision.\n~ \n0 DRAG~\nSyntax: drag <victim> <direction>\n        drag <object> <direction>\n\nYou can drag an object from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The object must be either\na takeable or a draggable object.\n\nYou can drag a person from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The person must be in a prone\nposition of some sort and can not be an aggressive monster.\nAnyone can drag monsters around. Only Clanners can drag\nother players around, and then only other clanners.\n~\n\n-1 DRAGON DRAGONS~\nDragons are those big scaley creatures. They may become very powerful as \nthey grow.  They have infrared vision and fly naturally.  They receive \nenhanced damage, and hand to hand combat skills for free, and naturally \ntheir breath is dangerous.  They are very costly to play in both time \nspent and experience needed as a trade off to their power. \n~\n\n-1 GARGOYLE~\nGargoyles are unliving animated stone creatures.  They are born of the\nnight, and as such, they suffer damage during the sunlight as remorts\ndo.  Gargoyles cannot escape this torment, even when indoors.  During\nthe night, Gargoyles gain resistance to some types of damage.  But\nduring the day, that resistance becomes a vulnerability.  They are\nmedium sized and can excel at any class.  They can fly, see in the\ninfrared spectrum, and have an inate ability to see invisible.\n~\n\n-1 ROCKBITER~\nRockbiters are gigantic creatures who are made of and thrive off of \nrocks and minerals.  They are the largest of all the races, and are \nthick and resiliant.  Their major weakness is that they are slow\nof movement.  Although their minds are relatively keen, they are\nprone to fall victim to mental attacks.  Although they are not very\nwise when young, they gain wisdom with age.\n~\n\n-1 FAERIES~\nFaeries are tiny little winged creatures, with great vision and perception.\nThey can all fly, see in the dark, and even detect invisible and hidden\ncreatures.  They are the best spellcasters of any of the races in terms\nof sheer magical prowess, but they have horrible strength and low hit points.\nThey are difficult to maladict, but they are incredibly agile and dodge\nbetter than any other race.  They also receive the dodge skill for free.\n~\n\n-1 MUTANTS~\nMutants are a unique race of unstable beings.  They have a natural form that\nvaguely resembles humans, but they will, at random times, mutate into other\nraces.  When they mutate, they take on the resistances, vulnerabilities,\nsize, and special characteristics of that race.  Their maximum attributes\nchange as well.  Mutants may learn skills unique to a given race, and retain\nthat knowledge long after they've changed to something else.  They have no \ncontrol over what they become.  Note that mutants will also change their CP\ndepending on what race they turn into, and will spend the overwhelming majority\nof their time with smaller CP than the mutant race naturally has.  This is not\na race for the impatient or inexperienced.  Your results will vary wildly from\nthose of other mutants.\n~\n\n-1 ELF ELVES~\nElves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They\nlack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,\nboth in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at\nbest fair talent as warriors or priests.\n\nElves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.\nBecause they are notoriously hard to spot, and so all elves, regardless of \nclass, may use sneak and hide.\n~\n\n-1 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALF~\nHalf-elves are decendents of the Elven race, yet along the way, they\nstrayed from the pure path of Elven lineage to persue true happiness\noutside their blood.  Half-elves are decendent, in majority, from\nhumans and elves.  Due to this, they are quite balanced, nearly\nexact, between the human, and that of the elf.  They have the ability\nto sneak like an elf, with their lithe bodies (if capable to do so),\nbut they have also learned to strengthen themselves, healing quickly\nas a natural ability.  They also have the ability to see in the dark\nlike their forefather elves.\n~\n\n-1 VOLARE~\nVolare are a race of angelic creatures, decended from the heavens from\nthe eyes of Mojo.  As he wept, they were created.  Volare, being good\nof nature, resist the powers of light, while are crippled by the powers\nof darkness.  With their natural abilities, they were given the nature\nto help mortals through creation, cures, and defend themselves through\ncombat.\n~\n\n-1 YINN~\n   The Yinn are a race of bipedal canines.

Being so tiny they are more vulnerable to cold and\npoison.\n~\n\n-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~\nHumans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of\nadventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,\nthey are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may\nalso train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to\ngain more benefit from magical devices.\n~\n\n-1 OGRE OGRES~\nOgres are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.

(Only giant warriors recive bash).\n~\n\n-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~\nMagical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the\nnecessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The\nitem skills are as follows:\n\nscrolls   The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')\nstaves    The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')\nwands   The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') \n~\n \n-1 'GROUP HEADER'~\nThe following skills and groups are available to your chacter:\n(this list may be seen again by typing list)\n{YNOTE:{x  The more skills you add, the higher your creation points will \n           be.

But beware, the skills you pick\nat character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are \npaid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the\nharder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to\npractice.\n\nSkill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells\nthat are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a \ndefault skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced \nselection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.\n\nThe experience breakdown is as follows: \npoints   exp/level     points   exp/level\n40        1000         90        6000\n50        1500         100       8000\n60    2000         110      12000\n70        3000         120      16000 \n80        4000         130      24000\nThe table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.\n~\n\n-1 BASICS 'MHS BASICS'~\nThe basic skills:\n\nEvery character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default\nset that all characters receive.  The default skills are:\n\nrecall    essential escape skill (see help recall)\nscrolls   reading of scrolls and other magical volumes\nstaves    use of magical staves\nwands   use of magical wands\nscan      checking who is in the area\nswimming  swimming through traverable water\n\nfor class defaults, check the classes themselves.\n~\n\n-1 DRUID DRUIDS~\nDruids specialize in the control of magic in all it's forms.

Rogues are also extremely difficult to detect\nand are very good at sneaking and hiding.  Rogues gain hp and mana the same as\na standard thief.\n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTER~\nThe Enchanter receives no new spells or skills, but (s)he is the absolute\nfinest enchanting mage in the realm.  The enchanter not only succeeds more\noften, but has the ability to do super-enchants, that are twice as good\nas even the impression 'brilliant' enchantments.\n~\n\n-1 BRAWLER~\n\n Brawlers are practiced at fighting multiple opponents.  Even while engaged\n in combat, they can switch the focus of their attacks to somebody else.  The\n do this through use of the \"attack\" command.  They can switch to either \n another person who is fighting them, or try to draw an idle third party into\n the fight.  This ability does not override pkill ranges, clan/non-clan status,\n or kill stealing code.\n\n~\n\n-1 WU JEN 'WU JEN'~\nPractitioners of the oriental magical arts, the Wu Jen specializes in\nself enhancement.  By {Wfocus{xing their mana to cast a spell they literally\ndamage themselves to increase the strength of the spell.

Sometimes a failure in the sight will inform the victim\nthat someone is searching for them.  Anyone may succeed on an NPC, but\nnon-clanners will not be able to use this spell on clanners. This is a\nmental attack type.\n~\n\n-1 ACROBAT~\nThe Acrobat kit combines quick reflexes with dexterity to create an agile\nand dangerous thief.  The acrobat is difficult to hit, and difficult to \nkeep in one place for very long.  Their ability to use the {Ctumbling{x\nskill provides them with a unique ability to avoid getting hit.\n\nSEE ALSO: {Ctumbling{x\n~\n\n-1 TUMBLING~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nTumbling is a special acrobat ability.  Tumbling increases the user's\ndodging ability, as well as permits him/her to roll out of the way of \nbashes, and even roll from a bash into a standing position.\n~\n\n-1 BLADEMASTERS~\nThe Blademaster is a double-warrior reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal warrior, and can specialize in any weapon group.  The\nBlademaster is ultra-accurate with his/her weapons, and is very difficult to\ndodge, parry, or block, and almost impossible to disarm.  However, the \nBlademasters has the unique ability to disarm a weapon and catch it.  They\nalso have access to the 'dual wield' skill.\n~\n\n-1 'DUAL WIELD'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nDual wield permits a Blademaster to use two different weapons at once, \nallowing for a strategic combinatino of special flags and damage types.\nTo use dual wield, the Blademaster simply wears two seperate weapons. \nThis skill -only- works while the Blademaster has two weapons.  If his or\nher primary weapon is somehow disarmed, he/she must wear another.  The\nsecondary weapon must be either exotic, or of the same weapon group as the\noriginal.  This combined with specialization makes for a powrful fighting\ncharacter in the Blademaster.  The secondary weapon must also be lighter\nthan the primary.  Finally, it is possible to use a sword-dagger combination.\n~\n-1 CRUSADE~\nThis spell is available only to those who know the piety spell group.  It\nallows you to call upon the power of your diety to drain a targets sacrifice\npoints.

They specialize in control of their body\nand using it to it's full potential.  As such they get and AC bonus on\narmor worn on body locations that normally do not receive bonuses.  They\ncan control their life energy, or 'chi', lowering their movement costs\nand they can master the art of throwing their opponent to the ground.\n~\n\n-1 MONK MONKS~\nMonks are thief clerics.  They specialize in special combat arts as well\nas issues of spirit and religion.  They are better able to defend\nthemselves and their AC is based on the weight of their armor, not it's\nstrength.  They are masters of kailindo, an anceint martial art.\n~\n\n-1 ELEMENTALIST~\n\nThe elementalist is a highly specialized mage.  Sacraficing the traditional\ntools of the trade, the elementalist has access to a handful of clerical\nspells, and an entire arsenal of new spells.

Any other weapon skills must be\npurchased, at a very high rate.\n\nSee 'help mage default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' ~\nClerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.

They are better fighters than\nclerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.\n\nAll thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as \nwell.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection\nis chosen.  \n\nSee 'help thief default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' ~\nWarriors live for combat and the thrill of battle.

This group is\nusable by all classes.\n\ncall lightning  summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right\ncontrol weather changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster\nfaerie fire surrounds the target in a glowing aura\nfaerie fog  reveals all hidden creatures in the room\nlightning bolt  sends a bolt of electricity into the target\n\n(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)\n~\n\n-1 BACKSTAB~\nBackstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It \ncan be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.\nThe damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his\nweapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.\n~\n\n-1 BASH~\nThe bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock\nyour foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the\nbash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon\nis not generally a wise idea.\n~\n\n-1 THROW THROWS~\nThe throw skill is a samurai talent.  In a single deft movement the samurai's\nvictim is flipped and thrown to the ground putting them into a daze.\n~\n\n-1 KAILINDO~\nAn anceint martial arts skill, kailindo is the art of blocking and striking.\n~\n\n-1 BERSERK~\nOnly powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage\nin combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge\nsurge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  \nBerserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.\n~\n\n-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~\nConsider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever \ncombatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The\nblindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity\nhelps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may\nlearn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 GAROTTE~\nThis skill is the art of choking your opponent into unconsciousness using\na wire or rope with handles on the ends as a weapon.  These weapons are\ngenerally useless for any other purpose.  Success depends on suprising the\nvictim.  This skill is available only to assassins.\n~\n\n-1 DISARM~\nDisarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your\nopponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you\nare skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves\nand warriors may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 DODGE~\nIn the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not\nbe where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the\ncharacter's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the \ntarget. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the\nattacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.\n~\n\n-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~\nWarriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are\nable to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked\nfor with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus\nis very low indeed.\n~\n\n-1 ENVENOM~\nThe envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to\nwin a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.\nOr, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.\nFood, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned\nfood or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to\nbe more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could\ndrink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on\nthe other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison \nburns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates \nquickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.\n~\n\n-1 'HAND TO HAND'~\nHand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this\nstyle of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.\nTrained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.\nClerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages\nmay also learn it.\n~\n\n-1 KICK~\nKicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful\nkick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters\nand clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn\nit.\n~\n\n-1 PARRY~\nIf at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting \nattacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for\nfull success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced\ndamage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the\ndefender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.\n~\n\n-1 RESCUE~\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with\nthe rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede\nin combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the\nfavor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as\nwell as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and\nthe target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)\n~\n\n-1 TRIP~\nBack by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves\nusing any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.\nTripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will\nfind the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.\n~\n\n-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~\nTraining in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes\nin combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every\nround.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a \nvery hard time with it.\n~\n\n-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~\nTraining in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike\nin a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect\nthird attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly\nskilled thieves may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 HIDE SNEAK~\nHide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.\nHide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the\ncharacter remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to\nsneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and\nthieves may learn these skills.\n~\n\n-1 'FAST HEALING'~\nThe fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,\nor sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general \ntoughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is \npossible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it\nvery difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.\n~\n\n-1 LORE~\nLore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use\nof the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,\nconcerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value\nof an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may\nlearn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard\nto use.\n~\n\n-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~\nHaggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to\nmatch wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,\nor to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are \nalready very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best \nguard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, \nalthough other classes may learn it as well.\n~\n\n-1 PEEK~\nThe peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,\nthe better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are\nharder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most\ncommon practicioners.\n~\n\n-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~\nLock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain\naccess to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  \nintelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may\nlearn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.\n~\n\n-1 COMMUNION~\nA skill unique to clerics, the communion skill allows the cleric to convert\nhis or her past offerings to his/her deity into hit points or mana.  The\nuse of communion is automatic, and is done when the cleric attempts to\ncast a spell without having enough mana, or is attacked and does not have\nenough hit points to survive the hit.\n~\n\n-1 MEDITATION~\nThis skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and\nmantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.\nThieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have\nmuch trouble learning to meditate.\n~\n\n-1 CHI~\nThis skill is the art of controling your life force.  When control total\ncontrol of your chi is acheived movement costs can be cut in half.\n~\n-1 'DETECT GOOD' 'DETECT EVIL'~\nSyntax: cast 'detect good'\n        cast 'detect evil' \n\t\nThese spells enable the caster to detect good and evil characters. Good \nreveals a golden aura and Evil reveals a red aura. Casting of either of\nthese spell will reveal both good and evil, it is not necessary to cast\nboth upon yourself.\n~\n\n-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~\nSyntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>\n \nDispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on \nthe pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their\nperil.\n~\n\n\n-1 'RECHARGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'recharge' <item>\n\nThe recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.\nFully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell\nis proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be\nrecharged one time successfully.\n~\n\n-1 'DEMONFIRE'~\nSyntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>\n\nDemonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those\nwho follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to \ninflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.\n~\n\n-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>\n\nRay of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth\na beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants\nof evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike \ncasters who are tainted by evil.\n~\n\n-1 'PORTAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'portal' <target>\n\nThe portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal\nto the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are\nentered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot\nbe made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.\nPortal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the\nsecret of this material component has been lost...\n~\n-1 'SHARPEN'~\nSyntax: sharpen 'weapon'\n\nSharpen is an inate ability that all dwarves know how to do.  It allows \nthem to place a sharper edge on a bladed weapon for a time.\nSharpen requires a special type of stone be used in order to work properly.\n\n                    WARNING WARNING WARNING\n\nThere is a very real chance that attempting to sharpen a weapon will \nDESTROY the weapon.  Dwarves learn with age how to avoid damaging weapons\nand causing anguish. \n~\n\n-1 'NEXUS'~\nSyntax: cast 'nexus' <target>\n\nThis spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the\nonly difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus \nspell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered\nportal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret\nof which has been lost...\n~\n\n-1 'HEAT METAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>\n\nHeat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary \naccording to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment\n(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,\ncausing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the\nprocess (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).\nThis spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY WORD'~\nSyntax: cast 'holy word'\n\nHoly word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with\ndisasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful\nblessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the\nroom are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of\nopposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)\nare struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers\ngreatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and \ndrained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.\n~\n\n-1 FRENZY~\nSyntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>\n\nThe frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing\nhis or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine\nwrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, \nmaking the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm\nspell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's \nalignment.\n~\n\n-1 CALM~\nSyntax: cast 'calm' \n\nOne of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is\nthe calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed\ncreatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage\nin combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence \nactivity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --\neither all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who\nare immune to magic) or none is.\n~\n\n-1 HASTE~\nSyntax: cast 'haste' <target>\n\nThe haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing\nan extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive\nabilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,\nsuch that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating\nthe slow spell. (see 'help slow').\n~\n\n-1 FEAST~\nSyntax: cast 'feast' <target>\n\nThe 'feast' spell is sort of like casting a magic mushroom inside of\nthe belly of your intended target.  Feast will fill up any creature, be\nit living, dead, or undead.  There are times, however, when a given\ncreature doesn't -wish- to be full.  If the victim has 'nocancel' enabled,\nhe or she will receive a saving throw versus the feast spell.\n~\n\n-1 FAMINE~\nSyntax: cast 'famine' <target>\n\nThe 'famine' spell is the antithesis of the 'feast' spell.  It drains\nsustenance from the target, leaving him or her in need of water and \nfood, or whatever else it is the victim thrives off of.  Although the\n'famine' spell is offensive, there are creatures who have a need to be\nhungry.  Hence, if you attempt to cast 'famine' on yourself, you'll always\nsucceed.\n~\n\n-1 SLOW~\nSyntax: cast 'slow' <target>\n\nDespite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell\nwith it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,\nit slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate\nof attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing\nrates, due to reduced metabolism.\n~\n\n-1 PLAGUE~\nSyntax: cast 'plague' <target>\n\nThe plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,\nsapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to\ndeath.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like\nwildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.  Willfully spreading\nplague around and among other players is generally frowned upon, and if you\ndo not take responsibility for your sickness and cure yourself, you may\nfind yourself the subject of the wrath of the immortals.\n~\n\n-1 'CREATE ROSE'~\nSyntax: cast 'create rose'\n\nA romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game\nuse whatsoever.\n~\n\n-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL' 'PROTECTION NEUTRAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>\n        cast 'protection good' <target>\n\tcast 'protection neutral' <target>\n\nThe protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate\nethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not\nbe cast on others, and one person cannot carry more then one defense at \nthe same time.\n~\n\n0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>\n \nThis spell increases the strength of the target character.\n~\n\n-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~\nSyntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>\n\nChain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning\nthat arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully\nexpended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members \nof a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other\nviable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on\ngroups of creatures.\n~\n\n-1 FARSIGHT~\nSyntax: cast 'farsight'\n  cast 'farsight' <direction>\n\nThe farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her\nto see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense\nconcentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.\nThe spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in\nall directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much\nfarther away.\n~\n\n-1 MASS HEALING~\nSyntax: cast 'mass healing' \n\nThe mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell\non all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good\nmeasure.\n~\n\n-1 'FLOATING DISC'~\nSyntax: cast 'floating disc'\n\nThis useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster\naround, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight\npenalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and\nusually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a \nmaximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location\non the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it\nto run out of energy.\n~\n\n-1 FIREPROOF~\nSyntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>\n\nThe fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,\nto protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected\nby this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.\nAlthough inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical\nfor protecting large numbers of objects.\n~\n\n-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~\nSyntax: alias\n  alias <word>\n  alias <word> <substitution>\n  unalias <word>\n\nThe alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,\naliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.\nAlias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with \nthat name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument \nproduces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new\ncommand.  Examples of use:\n\nalias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'\nalias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'\n\nOnly the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.\n~\n\n-1 PSIONICS~\nThe psionic group is a group of mental energy spells.\n\nThe following spells are available in the Psionics group:\n\n'psionic blast'      - does mental damage to the victim and some back to\n                       the spellcaster\n'tower of iron will' - protects the caster from mental attacks\n'body weaponry'      - turns your hands into weapons and your skin to armor\n'lay on hands'       - drains life away from the caster and gives it to\n                       the victim, can kill the caster if the victim needs\n                       more life than the caster has to give\n'mirror image'       - your opponent begins fighting something they think\n                       is you, giving you time to escape\n~\n\n-1 'PSIONIC BLAST' PSIBLAST~\nSyntax: cast 'psionic blast' <victim>\n\nA Psionic Blast will do damage to your victim based on your level,\nintelligence and constitution.  It will also do a fraction of that\ndamage back to you.\n~\n\n-1 'TOWER OF IRON WILL'~\nSyntax: cast 'tower of iron will'\n\nOnce protected by the Tower of Iron Will the caster becomes resistant\nto mental attacks.\n~\n\n-1 'BODY WEAPONRY'~\nSyntax: cast 'body weaponry' <target>\n\nOnce affected by Body Weaponry your hands become magical weapons when \nfighting un-armed and your skin becomes magical armor.\n~\n\n-1 'LAY ON HANDS'~\nSyntax: cast 'lay on hands' <target>\n\nYou lay your hands on another and your life force flows into them.\nIf the one you are giving life to needs more than you have to give\nyou may become mortally wounded.\n~\n\n-1 'MIRROR IMAGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'mirror image'\n\nYour opponent begins fighting something they believe to be you giving\nyou a chance to escape, or...\n~\n\n-1 'BESTOW HOLINESS'~\nSyntax: cast 'bestow holiness' <object>\n\nThis Crusader spell is designed with the favored of the gods in mind.\nThe Crusader can imbue a normal weapon with the holiness of the gods,\nmaking that weapon the perfect selection of any Paladin.\nThere is a chance that a weapon can be given the holy flag permanently.\nHowever, when this happens, there is also a chance that the weapon will\nevaporate.\n\n~\n\n-1 'HOLD PERSON'~\nSyntax: cast 'hold person' <victim>\n\nBringing down the wrath of the gods, the Crusader can stop his\nopponent from moving with this spell.  The victim is prevented from\nwalking anywhere and is unable to use his or her skills,spells or\nabilities. If the held person is attacked, the spell fails.\n~\n\n-1 'ENDURE HEAT' 'ENDURE COLD'~\nSyntax: cast 'endure <heat|cold>' <target>\n\nThis spell, castable only by Crusaders, blesses the target with\nresistance to cold- or heat-based attacks.  It only works on creatures\nthat do not already have sort of innate resistance or vulnerability to\nthese attacks.  It won't, for exmaple, work on a dragon to counter their\nvulnerability to cold.\n~\n\n-1 'AID'~\nSyntax: cast 'aid' <target>\n\nThe Crusader can temporarily increase his or her maximum hit points, or\nthose of a companion through the use of the aid spell.  The increase is\na fraction of the target's maximum hit points.\n~\n\n-1 'INFILTRATE'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nThe infiltrate ability allows rogues to enter private or solitary rooms\neven while they are occupied.  Additionally, infiltrate can also be used\nto enter guilds to which the rogue does not belong.  Lastly, infitrate\ncan allow the rogue to pick up objects without being seen by others in\nthe room.\n\n~\n\n-1 WIZARD~\nThe Wizard is the mage double-reclass.  They receive hit points and mana \nas mages do.  The Wizard is the best enchantor in the land, as well has\nhaving access to a handful of choice spells.  In the illusion group, the\nWizard receives blur.  In the maladictions group he finds 'feeblemind' 'forget'\nand 'fumble'.  In transportation, 'knock', and in Necromancy, 'enervation'.\nSee the individual helpfiles on these spells for more information.\n~\n\n-1 BLUR~\nSyntax: cast 'blur' <target>\n\nThe blur spell is part of the illusion group, but is accessible only to\nWizards.  It improves the wizards armor class, while also making it easier\nfor him or her to dodge incoming attacks.  It can be cast on others as well.\nUnlike most defensive spells, it can also be cast while fighting.\n~\n\n-1 KNOCK~\nSyntax: cast 'knock' <direction>\n        cast 'knock' <object>\n\nThe knock spell is the Wizard's skeleton key.  It allows him to break open\nsealed doors, whether they are locked by key or by magic.  This spell does\nnot always, succeed, however, and is subject to some of the same limitations\nas the thief's 'pick lock' ability.\n\nThere also is a knock command...\n\nSyntax: knock <direction>\n\nProvided there is a door there, you will knock on the door and the people\nin the room on the other side will hear you knocking.\n\nThis knock command code was written by John Patrick and is\nUsed with permission (j.s.patrick@ieee.org)\n~\n\n-1 FUMBLE~\nSyntax: cast 'fumble' <target>\n\nThe fumble spell makes the victim clumsy and awkward, lessing his or her\nability to defend himself and stay on his or her feat.  Victims of the \nfumble spell will drop weapons, trip when walking, fall over when trying to\ndodge, and basically be a total clutz.  They're also easier to bash.\n~\n\n-1 FORGET~\nSyntax: cast 'forget' <victim>\n\nThe forget spell erases pieces of the victim's memory, forcing him or her\nto rely on instinct instead of knowledge and experience.  The victim of\nthe powerful 'forget' spell will find that his or her skills work at a\nlower level.\n~\n\n-1 FEEBLEMIND~\nSyntax: cast 'feeblemind' <victim>\n\nThe feeblemind spell targets the victim's intellect and intuition, and\nrips apart his or her ability to reason.  It also reduces their willpower\nand makes it easier for the Wizard to land subsequent spells.\n~\n\n-1 ENERVATION~\nSyntax: cast 'enervation' <victim>\n\nOne of the most powerful of Necromantic magicks, the enervation spell snuffs\nout the life force of the victim.  It causes him or her to cast all spells\nat an effectively lower level.  The amount of level drain is mostly random,\nbut victims with high wisdom tend to suffer less.\n~\n\n-1 'SACRED GUARDIAN'~\nSyntax: cast 'sacred guardian' <target>\n\nThis Crusader spell turns the gods' eyes on the target.  When the \ntarget is attacked any time during the duration of the spell, all members of\nthe target's clan are notified by the gods that he or she is in danger.\n~\n\n-1 'ICE STORM'~\nSyntax: cast 'ice storm' <target>\n\nThis water spell summons forth a blizzard of ice shards that pierce your\nopponent's armor and do mean, painful things.

It always ignores his/her friends.\n~\n\n-1 'FLAME SHIELD' 'FROST SHIELD' 'ELECTRIC SHIELD'~\nSyntax: cast 'flame shield'\n\tcast 'frost shield' \n\tcast 'electric shield'\n\nThese shields surround the Elementalist with a protective aura from\nthe specific element. The shields absord damage of the element from\nweapons, but not from spells.  It also doubles the chances that the\nspellcaster's equipment will survive an attack, be it from weapon\nor breath. Only one element shield may be surrounding the Elementalist\nat any one time.\n\nNote: Flame Shield does not counter the {Cheat metal{x spell.\n~\n\n-1 'ELECTRICSWORD' 'FLAMESWORD' 'FROSTSWORD'~\nSytax: cast 'electricsword' <weapon>\n       cast 'flamesword' <weapon>\n       cast 'frostsword' <weapon>\n\nThese weapon enchanting spells belong to the Element Air, Element\nFire and Element Water respectively.  These spells will imbue a\nweapon with a power from the Plane.  The weapon must be in the\nElementalist's inventory for it to work.  This spell has a high\nmana cost and short duration, and also drains the Elementalist\nof his health for a short time.\n~\n\n-1 MISTFORM 'MIST FORM'~\nSyntax: cast 'mistform'\n\nThis air spell makes the caster insubstantial, and improves his/her armor\nclass.  It also has the ability to prevent attacks from landing at all,\nthough this ability breaks down the mistform spell quickly, causing it to\nwear off more rapidly.\n~\n\n-1 'DUST STORM'~\nSyntax: cast 'dust storm' <victim>\n\nThe sphere of Elemental Air contributes the 'dust storm' spell to the\nElementalist's inventory of attacks.  This versatile spell summons forth\na storm of debris, dust, and dirt towards his/her enemy.  The storm can\nrender the victim sightless, as well as anybody the victim is grouped\nwith.

They are completely\nincharge of the necromantic spells.  Players who take this kit gain one\nnew spell (wraithform) and an innate ability (vampiric touch).\nNecromancers gain bonuses for being evil when they cast necromantic \nspells. If a necromancer is not living up to their alignment expectations,\nthey suffer a penality when casting necromantic spells.\nBecause they live an evil life, their alignment will not drop\nwhen these spells are cast.\nNecromancers are also very creepy, so they do not cast beguiling spells\nvery well.  \n\nsee also:  vampiric touch\nsee also:  wraithform\n\n~\n0 WRAITHFORM~\n\nsyntax:  c 'wraithform'\n\nBy casting this spell, the necromancer is turned into a wraith like mist.\nBecause they are made of mist, they are limited in thier actions.  \nLikewise, there is very little on this world that can affect someone in\nwraithform.\nThe necromancer *MUST* leave wraithform before the duration of the spell\nhas worn out, or they will die.  All of thier material possessions will\ncross into the Netherworld.\nEntering into and leaving wraithform does require quite some time to \naccomplish.\n\nsee also: UNWRAITH or unwraith, I would really really suggest you read\n          the unwraith helpfile. -Boogums\n\n\n~\n0 UNWRAITH~\n\nsyntax:  unwraith\n\nThis is an automatic command, there is no percent or chance of failure.\nThis command takes the necromancer out of wraithform.

You have gotten beyond the learning stages of MHS.  From\nthis point on, the game system will not hold your hand any longer.  You\nwill have to pay for use of the healer, you will need to warp your equipment\nto fit you, and you will need to save your sac points wisely, as the recall\ncommand will not work for you anymore.  Good luck!  If you haven't clanned\nyet but would like do, make sure you do so before level 21 or you'll never\nbe able to.\n\n~\n\n20 LEVELTWENTY~\n\nNOTICE:  This is the last level at which you will be able to join the clan\nsystem.

Once again, if you wish to join the clan system,\nLONER NOW!\n\nSEE 'clan' 'loner'\n~\n52 VFORGE~\nCreating forge is pretty simple. \nYou need at least 4 different items created before your forge can be coded \nto work. \n* Actual forge\n* At least two item parts that are placed into forge when created \n* And end product of forge. \n\nWhen you have all these items created. Write a note to coders explaining \nyour need, also mention vnums for these itemparts and endproduct so recipe \ncan be coded.  \nAfter you receive the recipe numbers from coders, you can place them into \nvalue0-4 (v0-v4) in forge (so you can have max. 5 different recipes in one \nforge). \n\nFor more complicated forging, You may request skill to be placed into \nrecipe that is taken into account when mortal forges your items. \nFor example: itempart1 and itempart2 is forged into endproduct in \nforge, if mortal has bleed skill he succeeds to create new item. But \nif anyone else but nosferatu tries to forge anything with these items, \nthey just dissolve from the forge leaving nothing behind.\n\nBelow is an example that is to be in the recipes.are file\n#22                      - recipe number\nnoskill 0                - skill and percent needed\n10741                    - vnum of the forge\n10716                    - vnum of the item to be created \n10457 15234 20764 111 0  - vnums of the components (upto five)\n\n\n~\n0 FORGE~\nUsage: forge <forge container>\n\n    Certain items in the game can be placed in a \"forge container\"\nand \"forged\" into a new item.  These items are part of a recipe that\nan Immortal has created, and may include any item(s) in the game.\nThere is a forge currently in the Armor Shop in Midgaard.\n\nThere may or may not be a skill requirement that needs to be met in\norder to forge sucessfully.  There is no way for you to know if this\nis the case.\n\nImmortals:  see the VFORGE helpfile\n~\n\n-1 GRENADE~\nSyntax: grenade <grenade> <target>\n\n   All classees are equally capable of using grenade weapons.  Different \ngrenades may or may not have different affects on their targets.  Only\ngrenade items may be thrown at your targets.  Grenades may not be used \nwhile in combat.\n~\n\n-1 ALCHEMY ALCHEMIST~\n  Alchemy is the art of creating magical potions.  Those with the Alchemist\nkit may create one of the following 6 potions.\n\n   1. Accuracy         - helps you hit things better\n   2. Magic Resistance - makes spells less likely to hurt you\n   3. Vision           - helps you see secret things, and even faded \n\t\t\t nethermancers\n   4. Restoration      - restores a small amount of magical energy\n   5. Speed            - reduces the delay on your actions\n   6. Molotov Cocktail - a weapon with which to smite your foes\n\nYou must be carrying sufficient gold to purchase the ingredients, and be\nin a magelab to make use of the alchemy skill.  The cost of the potion is \nautomatically deducted from your gold when you brew the potion.\n\nMolotov cocktails have a colour associated with them.  Each colour\nis indicative of a specific damage type.  It is up to you to determine\nwhich colours give which type of damage.\n\nSEE ALSO: grenade brew\n~\n\n-1 BREW~\nsyntax: brew <accuracy|resist|vision|mana|speed|molotov>\n\nNote: You must spell out the full name of the potion you wish to brew.\n      I.E. brew molotov NOT brew molo\n~\n\n-1 WYRMSLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-dragon\n\n    Wyrmslayers really don't like dragons.  No, you don't understand.\nThey *REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like dragons, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-lizard sentiment.  The Wyrmslayer spends his or her\nlife dedicated to the destruction of dragons, and so all Wyrmslayers are\ngiven {Cdagger{x and {Cspear{x, just to make sure they've got the tools of\nthe trade.  On top of that, Wyrmslayers are expert at getting their weapons\nthrough those damned dragon scales, and getting their spells past the\ndragon's natural magical resistance.  Due to their extreme hatred of dragons,\nthe Wyrmslayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal damage to the\nlizards.  This is not a special skill, but an inate ability that depends\nsolely on the Wyrmslayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BUFFY SLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-remort\n\n    Slayers really don't like undead.  No, you don't understand. They \n*REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like remorts, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-dead-guy sentiment.  Due to their extreme hatred \nof remorts, the Slayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal \ndamage to the undead.  This is not a special skill, but an inate \nability that depends solely on the Slayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BISHOP~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Paladin Crusader\n\n    The Bishop is a leader, and supreme spellcaster.  They do not cast\ntheir spells, they access their magic through the use of the {Choly chant{x.\nBishops receive enhanced mana gains, and have the ability to cast all of their\nspells while in combat.  Bishops also receive an extra 100 sac points, and\ncast their spells as a slight reduction in mana cost.\n\nNOTE: All Bishops should save at least two practices for 'holy chant' if \nthey wish to avoid being crippled in the spellcasting arena.\n\nSEE ALSO:  'holy chant'\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY CHANT' CHANT~\nSyntax: chant <spell> <target>\n\n    The chant command is used exactly like the 'cast' command.  The major\ndifference is that the Bishop has a skill percentage with 'chant', and  it\nis checked before he can cast a spell.  This means that Bishops have two skills\nthat must be at an adequate level: 'holy chant', and the spell being chanted.\nIt is advised that all Bishops save at least two practices for 'holy chant'\nbefore they take this kit.\n~\n\n-1 NINJA~\nAvailable to:  Thief Assassin Rogue\n\n    The ninja is the ultimate stealth machine, specializing in two unique\nabilities.  {CNinjitsu{c, and {CKurijitsu{x.  The Ninja also can sneak out \nof combat, and know which way he went.\n\nSEE ALSO: ninjitsu  kurijitsu\n~\n\n-1 NINJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Ninjitsu is the art of concealment, and adept practioners are completely\nimpossible to detect when using ninjitsu incombination with standard stealth-\nrelated skills.\n~\n\n-1 KURIJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Kurijitsu is the art of strategically placing your attacks on an   \nopponent.  Skilled practioners of kurijitsu can do incredible amounts of\ndamage with a single standard attack.  One must be very skilled in kurijitsu\nto fully realize its potential.\n~\n\n-1 PROPHET~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Monk Paladin Crusader\n\n    Of all the religious kits, the Prophet by far is the closest to his\ndeity.  Prophets are the specially chosen ones, who communicate most \nclearly and directly to their gods.  Consequently, they have the ability\nto call upon their faith to {Cimbue{x themselves with enhanced spellcasting\nabilities.  Furthermore, due to their closeness to their deities, Prophets\nreceive an extra practice any time they level.  Finally, Prophets improve\ntheir skills much more quickly than others through manual practice.\n\nSEE ALSO: imbue\n~\n\n-1 IMBUE~\nSyntax: cast 'imbue'\n\n    The 'imbue' spell is a special part of the Prophet kit, and raises the\nProphet's casting level.  The amount of the raise depends on the Prophet's\nclass.\n~\n\n-1 VINDICATOR~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Crusader\n               All races\n\n    The Vindicator is the most militant of religious figures, with a hardy\nframe, and a strong swordarm.  Vindicators are combat-oriented, and tough,\nnot to mention well atuned to the aspets of their gods that provide them  \nwith the most strength: anger.  Vindicators are the only clerics that  \nreceive the {Cthird attack{x skill, and also have the ability to cast a \nunique spell that invokes the {Cwrath{x of their gods.\n\nSEE ALSO: wrath\n~\n\n-1 WRATH~\nSyntax: cast 'wrath' <victim>\n\n\tThe spiritual Wrath of the gods can be invoked and cast upon\nanybody (barring clan/non-clan restrictions) at the will of the \nVindicator.  The spell has the potential to do enormous damage, even more\nso if used succesfully multiple times.  The lingering anger of the gods\nleaves a taint on the victim that can be used to double the damage of this\npowerful spell on the next succesful casting.  The Vindicator must be in\ngood standing with his or her deity for this spell to have its maximum\neffect.\n\n~\n\n-1 BARBARIAN~\nAvailable to:  Warrior Berzerker\n               All races\n\n   The Barbarian is a primal warrior, with brute strength and carnal\nrage as his primary offensive weapons.  Because of this, the Barbarian\nhas two special abilities, {Cendurance{x, and the powerful {Cbarbarian\nrage{x.  Both fit into the Barbarian's style of \"hurt now, ask questions\nlater, if there's anything left to interrogate.\"\n~\n\n-1 ENDURANCE~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The Endurance skill causes the barbarian to take less damage when he is \ninjured.  This includes weapon and magical damage, and it even will reduce\ndamage taken from attacks like backstabs, bites, and damage types that the\nbarbarian is vulnerable too.  The amount of reduction is random, but it can\nbe as high as 30%.\n~\n\n-1 'BARBARIAN RAGE'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The barbarian's rage is a unique type of berserk attack.  It kicks in\nautomatically.  The longer the barbarian has been in combat, the better\nthe chances are of the rage starting up.  Also, the longer the barbarian\nis in combat, the more potent the rage in when it finally does kick in.\nBecause the barbarian is a brute force combatant, he sacrafices some\nregard for personal safety while using the rage, and his AC will suffer.\n~\n\n-1 POQUAH PROWLER~\nPoquah and Prowler... Can't get much smoother than this. Now you know where\nthe 'Roxbury' social comes from.\n~\n\n-1 'KIT'~\n\nQ. What is a 'kit'?\nA. A kit is a special collection of new game mechanics and/or abilities that\nare available to specific classes.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of taking a kit?\nA. You receive special, unique abilities like new skills or spells, and you\nhave a secret card to play in the pkill game, since no one can tell what kit\nyou have.\n\nQ. What is the downside?\nA. You -must- pay practices to take a kit, there is no other way to get one.\n\nQ. Which kits are available for my class?\nA. See 'help kit list'.\n\nQ. Can I take multiple kits?\nA. Sort of.  If you take a kit, you get its skills/spells, but if you change\nkits later, you loose any of that kit's skills and special abilities.  For\nexample, if you take the 'enchanter' kit, and then later switch to another kit\nyou will loose your old enchanting abilities.\n\nQ. Can I trade my kit back in for the practices I spent on it?\nA. No.  Once you take a kit, you are irrevocably stuck with it.\n\nQ. How do I accept a kit?\nA. Type 'kit take <name>'\n\nQ. It says 'huh' when I type 'kit'!\nA. You must be at least level 10 to take a kit.\n\nQ. It says I don't have good enough attributes!\nA. Your -natural- attributes have to meet the minimum required for the kit.\n\nQ. How do I tell what the minimums are?\nA. Type 'kit info <name>'\n\nQ. If I remort, do I loose my kit?\nA. No, unless you were a remort hunter and remort :).  You will be out the\n   100 pracs.  Now, remorts CAN take a remort hunter kit, as long as the \n   kit does not hunt their type of remort.\n\nQ. If I reclass, do I loose my kit?\nA. Yes.\n\n~\n\n0 SHAMAN~\n\n   Shamans are tribal witch doctors, primitive practicioners of arcane magicks.\nTheir speciality is the practice of gradually and painfully killing their enemies.\nShamans are experts as inflicting disease upon people, and as such, are the primary\nusers of 'damage over time' spells.  Shaman DOT spells are the most powerful DOTs\nin the game, and can inflict hundreds of points of damage to a target.\n\n   Shamans have access to the 'disease' spell group, which contains four disease-\nbased DOT spells.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'damage over time' 'disease'\n~\n\n0 DISEASE~\nDisease Spell Group - Shaman Kit Only\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDamage Cap Level\n    \tLevel 18\tContagion\t\t35\n\tLevel 28\tBlight\t\t\t40\n\tLevel 38\tBoiling Blood\t\t45\n\tLevel 48\tScourge\t\t\t50\n\n\tThe four weapons of the Disease spell group.  Each does some damage when\ncast, and some recurring damage over the next few minutes.  Scourge lasts the\nlongest of these.  All of these spells have an effective level cap at which the\namount of damage they do ceases to increase with level.  Note that saving throws\nversus these spells are still done against the ACTUAL casting level of the caster.\nBut the affect caps at the above levels.  The spells cannot be cancelled.  The\nmedics of Midgaard have yet to devise a way to cure these diseases.\n\n\tAll cost 75 mana and have a 2-round delay.  Experienced victims of these\nspells have indicated that the further they get from the caster, the less damage\nthe spells do.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'shaman' 'damage over time'\n~\n\n-1 'KIT LIST'~\n\n KIT             AVAILABILTY\nAcrobat\t\tThief Rogue Assassin Monk\nAlchemist\tMage Wizard\nArcheologist    Any (except Remorts)\nBarbarian\tWarrior Berzerker\nBattlerager\tWarrior Cleric Crusader (Dwarf Only)\nBishop\t\tCleric Crusader Paladin\nBladesinger\tWarrior Blademaster Mage Wizard (Elf Only) \nBrawler  \tWarrior Thief Berzerker Samurai Rogue Blademaster\nBuffy\t\tAny (except Remorts)\nCavalier        Warrior Paladin Samurai\nEnchanter\tMage Wizard\nFence           Rogue Thief Assassin\nKnight\t\tWarrior Blademaster Cleric Paladin\nLycanthrope \n  Hunter        Any (except Remorts)\nMedium          Mage Cleric Monk Druid Elementalist Wizard Crusader\nMyrmidon\tWarrior Blademaster (except yinns)\nNature Friend\tDruid\nNecromancer     Mage Wizard\nNethermancer\tMage Wizard\nNinja\t\tThief Rogue Assassin\nProphet \tCleric Crusader Paladin Monk\nRanger\t\tWarrior Thief Rogue Blademaster\nScribe          Mage Wizard Cleric\nShaman\t\tMage Wizard Cleric Crusader\nShapeshifter\tDruid Elementalist\nSpirit Caller   Druid\nShadow Stalker  Thief Rogue\nStaff Crafter   {YDRUID{x Cleric Crusader\nSummoner\tElementalist\nVampyre Hunter  Any (Except Remorts)\nVindicator\tCleric Crusader\nWand Maker      Mage Wizard\nWarlock\t\tMage Wizard (Male Only)\nWitch\t\tMage Wizard (Female Only)\nWu Jen\t\tMage Monk Samurai\nWyrmslayer\tAny (except dragons)\n\n\nSome suggestions that you needn't bother with:\n    Do not suggest 'balance' things (\"If class X has 6 options, so should\n    class Y!\"  \"If there is a dwarf-only kit there should be a faerie-only\n    kit too!\").  Do not suggest overly specific things.  A 'knight' kit\n    would be ok.  A 'yinnish knight' or 'elven archer' or 'elf scribe' is\n    too specific.  Complaining about the availability of a given kit will not\n    get you anywhere.  Neither will complaining about the lack of kits for\n    a given race or class.

REMEMBER, this is something to do if you get bored at level \n51.  It is NOT intended to make you necessarily better than anyone else, \njust different.  If remorts are \"better\" then they deserve it.\n\n{WPeople who remort and have the vampyre hunter, archeologist, or \nlycanthrope hunter kit will have the kit stripped.

A Mummy\nis naturally no the best mover, so they receive less moves per level.\n\nFor more information on Remorts, see HELP REMORT.\n~\n\n-1 GOBLIN~\nGoblins are a mutant race, decended long ago from humans.  They\nare slightly more nimble than humans but a bit less hearty.  Goblins\nhave glowing red eyes and due to their awful diets are resistant\nto disease and poison.  Suprisingly they make better spellcasters \nthan they do fighters.  \n\n~\n-1 LASHER~\nLashers are a race of demonic beings. Born in heavens and cast down to seed\nfrom storms they are ill-suited to any particular class. With high strength\nand stamina they are quite resiliant so they get fast healing and meditation\nfor free and being born of the storm are resistant to the damage of lightning\nand fire. However, been cast down from the heavens they are quite vulnerable \nto the powers of light.\n~\n\n-1 DWARF DWARVES~\nDwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great\nstamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.\nThey are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long \nlifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor\nmages or thieves. \n\nDwarves are very resistant to poison, disease, and certian magics.  They\ncannot swim, and so are very vulnerable to drowning.  All dwarves receive\nberserk and sharpen regardless of class and can see in the dark with\ninfravision.\n~ \n0 DRAG~\nSyntax: drag <victim> <direction>\n        drag <object> <direction>\n\nYou can drag an object from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The object must be either\na takeable or a draggable object.\n\nYou can drag a person from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The person must be in a prone\nposition of some sort and can not be an aggressive monster.\nAnyone can drag monsters around. Only Clanners can drag\nother players around, and then only other clanners.\n~\n\n-1 DRAGON DRAGONS~\nDragons are those big scaley creatures. They may become very powerful as \nthey grow.  They have infrared vision and fly naturally.  They receive \nenhanced damage, and hand to hand combat skills for free, and naturally \ntheir breath is dangerous.  They are very costly to play in both time \nspent and experience needed as a trade off to their power. \n~\n\n-1 GARGOYLE~\nGargoyles are unliving animated stone creatures.  They are born of the\nnight, and as such, they suffer damage during the sunlight as remorts\ndo.  Gargoyles cannot escape this torment, even when indoors.  During\nthe night, Gargoyles gain resistance to some types of damage.  But\nduring the day, that resistance becomes a vulnerability.  They are\nmedium sized and can excel at any class.  They can fly, see in the\ninfrared spectrum, and have an inate ability to see invisible.\n~\n\n-1 ROCKBITER~\nRockbiters are gigantic creatures who are made of and thrive off of \nrocks and minerals.  They are the largest of all the races, and are \nthick and resiliant.  Their major weakness is that they are slow\nof movement.  Although their minds are relatively keen, they are\nprone to fall victim to mental attacks.  Although they are not very\nwise when young, they gain wisdom with age.\n~\n\n-1 FAERIES~\nFaeries are tiny little winged creatures, with great vision and perception.\nThey can all fly, see in the dark, and even detect invisible and hidden\ncreatures.  They are the best spellcasters of any of the races in terms\nof sheer magical prowess, but they have horrible strength and low hit points.\nThey are difficult to maladict, but they are incredibly agile and dodge\nbetter than any other race.  They also receive the dodge skill for free.\n~\n\n-1 MUTANTS~\nMutants are a unique race of unstable beings.  They have a natural form that\nvaguely resembles humans, but they will, at random times, mutate into other\nraces.  When they mutate, they take on the resistances, vulnerabilities,\nsize, and special characteristics of that race.  Their maximum attributes\nchange as well.  Mutants may learn skills unique to a given race, and retain\nthat knowledge long after they've changed to something else.  They have no \ncontrol over what they become.  Note that mutants will also change their CP\ndepending on what race they turn into, and will spend the overwhelming majority\nof their time with smaller CP than the mutant race naturally has.  This is not\na race for the impatient or inexperienced.  Your results will vary wildly from\nthose of other mutants.\n~\n\n-1 ELF ELVES~\nElves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They\nlack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,\nboth in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at\nbest fair talent as warriors or priests.\n\nElves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.\nBecause they are notoriously hard to spot, and so all elves, regardless of \nclass, may use sneak and hide.\n~\n\n-1 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALF~\nHalf-elves are decendents of the Elven race, yet along the way, they\nstrayed from the pure path of Elven lineage to persue true happiness\noutside their blood.  Half-elves are decendent, in majority, from\nhumans and elves.  Due to this, they are quite balanced, nearly\nexact, between the human, and that of the elf.  They have the ability\nto sneak like an elf, with their lithe bodies (if capable to do so),\nbut they have also learned to strengthen themselves, healing quickly\nas a natural ability.  They also have the ability to see in the dark\nlike their forefather elves.\n~\n\n-1 VOLARE~\nVolare are a race of angelic creatures, decended from the heavens from\nthe eyes of Mojo.  As he wept, they were created.  Volare, being good\nof nature, resist the powers of light, while are crippled by the powers\nof darkness.  With their natural abilities, they were given the nature\nto help mortals through creation, cures, and defend themselves through\ncombat.\n~\n\n-1 YINN~\n   The Yinn are a race of bipedal canines.  They hail from a frigid area\nof ice and storms, and so are resistant to cold and electricity.  However,\nlittle is known of their weakness, save that they do not like heat due\nto their natural climate, and area of origin.  They are a fairly intellegent\nrace, with an internal code of discipline and honor.  Even still, they have\nshort tempers, and quick swords, and do not hesitate to solve a problem\nthrough combat.  Yinn excel at most anything they do.  They are quite\nvicious.\n~\n\n-1 KENDER~\nKender are related to elves but with slightly higher strength, dexterity\nand constitution.  They lack a bit in wisdom and significantly in\nintelligence.  They are born thieves, too fidgety for other professions.\nBeing so so nimble they get the dodge skill for free and are resistant\nto being bashed.  Being so tiny they are more vulnerable to cold and\npoison.\n~\n\n-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~\nHumans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of\nadventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,\nthey are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may\nalso train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to\ngain more benefit from magical devices.\n~\n\n-1 OGRE OGRES~\nOgres are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Ogres make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nOgres resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Ogres,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only ogre warriors recive bash).\n\nThrough the years of combat,rage of fighting and pillaging, Ogres have learned\nthe scent of death.\n~\n\n-1 GIANT GIANTS~\nGiants are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nGiants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only giant warriors recive bash).\n~\n\n-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~\nMagical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the\nnecessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The\nitem skills are as follows:\n\nscrolls   The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')\nstaves    The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')\nwands   The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') \n~\n \n-1 'GROUP HEADER'~\nThe following skills and groups are available to your chacter:\n(this list may be seen again by typing list)\n{YNOTE:{x  The more skills you add, the higher your creation points will \n           be.  The higher your CP the more experience you will need to\n           level.  \n~\n\n-1 'GROUP HELP'~\nThe following commands are available:\nlist         display all groups and skills not yet bought\nlearned      show all groups and skills bought \npremise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups\nadd <name>   buy a skill or group\ndrop <name>  discard a skill or group\ninfo <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group\nhelp <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics\ndone       exit the character generation process\n~\n\n-1 'MENU CHOICE'~\nChoice (add,drop,list,help)?~\n\n-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~\nThe MHM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making\nhim or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick\nat character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are \npaid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the\nharder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to\npractice.\n\nSkill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells\nthat are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a \ndefault skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced \nselection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.\n\nThe experience breakdown is as follows: \npoints   exp/level     points   exp/level\n40        1000         90        6000\n50        1500         100       8000\n60    2000         110      12000\n70        3000         120      16000 \n80        4000         130      24000\nThe table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.\n~\n\n-1 BASICS 'MHS BASICS'~\nThe basic skills:\n\nEvery character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default\nset that all characters receive.  The default skills are:\n\nrecall    essential escape skill (see help recall)\nscrolls   reading of scrolls and other magical volumes\nstaves    use of magical staves\nwands   use of magical wands\nscan      checking who is in the area\nswimming  swimming through traverable water\n\nfor class defaults, check the classes themselves.\n~\n\n-1 DRUID DRUIDS~\nDruids specialize in the control of magic in all it's forms.  They\nbecome more powerful with age.  They may gain all the spell groups\nclerics or mages may gain as well as the special ability to control\ndefensive orbs.\n~\n\n-1 ROGUES~\nRogues are the consummate theives of Boinga.  They have access to all the same\nskills as a thief, including steal and slice, and perform these skills with\ngreater ease than does a thief.  Rogues are also extremely difficult to detect\nand are very good at sneaking and hiding.  Rogues gain hp and mana the same as\na standard thief.\n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTER~\nThe Enchanter receives no new spells or skills, but (s)he is the absolute\nfinest enchanting mage in the realm.  The enchanter not only succeeds more\noften, but has the ability to do super-enchants, that are twice as good\nas even the impression 'brilliant' enchantments.\n~\n\n-1 BRAWLER~\n\n Brawlers are practiced at fighting multiple opponents.  Even while engaged\n in combat, they can switch the focus of their attacks to somebody else.  The\n do this through use of the \"attack\" command.  They can switch to either \n another person who is fighting them, or try to draw an idle third party into\n the fight.  This ability does not override pkill ranges, clan/non-clan status,\n or kill stealing code.\n\n~\n\n-1 WU JEN 'WU JEN'~\nPractitioners of the oriental magical arts, the Wu Jen specializes in\nself enhancement.  By {Wfocus{xing their mana to cast a spell they literally\ndamage themselves to increase the strength of the spell.  They can also\ncast 'enhance' on themselves to increase their vitals temporarily.\n\nSEE ALSO: enhance, focus\n~\n\n-1 FOCUS~\nSyntax: focus 'spell' <target>\n\nFocusing the user's mana increases the power of the spell at the expense of\ndamaging the caster.\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCE~\nSyntax: cast 'enhance'\n\nThe spell randomly increases one of the caster's vital stats temporarily.\nIt also damages the caster.\n~\n\n-1 SEER~\nThe Seer kit takes advantage of high intelligence and wisdom to give\nthe ability to cast 'farsee'.  The seer must know the world of Boinga\nwell and by name to take full advantage of their gift.\n\nSEE ALSO: farsee\n~\n\n-1 FARSEE~\nSyntax: cast 'farsee' victim\n\nIf sucessful the spell reveals the name of the room that the spell's\nvictim is in.  Sometimes a failure in the sight will inform the victim\nthat someone is searching for them.  Anyone may succeed on an NPC, but\nnon-clanners will not be able to use this spell on clanners. This is a\nmental attack type.\n~\n\n-1 ACROBAT~\nThe Acrobat kit combines quick reflexes with dexterity to create an agile\nand dangerous thief.  The acrobat is difficult to hit, and difficult to \nkeep in one place for very long.  Their ability to use the {Ctumbling{x\nskill provides them with a unique ability to avoid getting hit.\n\nSEE ALSO: {Ctumbling{x\n~\n\n-1 TUMBLING~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nTumbling is a special acrobat ability.  Tumbling increases the user's\ndodging ability, as well as permits him/her to roll out of the way of \nbashes, and even roll from a bash into a standing position.\n~\n\n-1 BLADEMASTERS~\nThe Blademaster is a double-warrior reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal warrior, and can specialize in any weapon group.  The\nBlademaster is ultra-accurate with his/her weapons, and is very difficult to\ndodge, parry, or block, and almost impossible to disarm.  However, the \nBlademasters has the unique ability to disarm a weapon and catch it.  They\nalso have access to the 'dual wield' skill.\n~\n\n-1 'DUAL WIELD'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nDual wield permits a Blademaster to use two different weapons at once, \nallowing for a strategic combinatino of special flags and damage types.\nTo use dual wield, the Blademaster simply wears two seperate weapons. \nThis skill -only- works while the Blademaster has two weapons.  If his or\nher primary weapon is somehow disarmed, he/she must wear another.  The\nsecondary weapon must be either exotic, or of the same weapon group as the\noriginal.  This combined with specialization makes for a powrful fighting\ncharacter in the Blademaster.  The secondary weapon must also be lighter\nthan the primary.  Finally, it is possible to use a sword-dagger combination.\n~\n-1 CRUSADE~\nThis spell is available only to those who know the piety spell group.  It\nallows you to call upon the power of your diety to drain a targets sacrifice\npoints.  However, the price of doing this is not cheap, an eye for an eye\nand all...\n~\n-1 HOLY SILENCE~\nHoly Silence cuts off the targets communication with thier diety.  \n~\n-1 SEE SOUL~\nSee Soul lets you peer into the deepest depths of a person, revealing thier\nalignment and diety.\n~\n-1 INDULGENCE~\nSpell: Indulgence\nA paladin affected by indulgence will not have their alignment change\neither by killing mobs, use of necromancy spells, or use of alignment\nchanging weapons.\n~\n-1 CRUSADERS~\nCrusaders are a double-cleric  reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal cleric, and access to all the same abilities, even the\ncoveted communion skill.  They also receive some extra spells:\n'hold person', 'endure heat' 'endure cold' 'bestow holiness' 'aid' and\n'sacred guardian'.\n~\n\n-1 SAMURAI SAMURAIS~\nSamurai are fighter mages.  They specialize in control of their body\nand using it to it's full potential.  As such they get and AC bonus on\narmor worn on body locations that normally do not receive bonuses.  They\ncan control their life energy, or 'chi', lowering their movement costs\nand they can master the art of throwing their opponent to the ground.\n~\n\n-1 MONK MONKS~\nMonks are thief clerics.  They specialize in special combat arts as well\nas issues of spirit and religion.  They are better able to defend\nthemselves and their AC is based on the weight of their armor, not it's\nstrength.  They are masters of kailindo, an anceint martial art.\n~\n\n-1 ELEMENTALIST~\n\nThe elementalist is a highly specialized mage.  Sacraficing the traditional\ntools of the trade, the elementalist has access to a handful of clerical\nspells, and an entire arsenal of new spells.  Like druids, Elementalists\ngrow in power as they age, their spells begin to have new effects and\nmore devestating results.  Their combat skills are marginal, but it is more\nthan made up for by a an impressive command of the world's natural forces.\n\nA default elementalist begins with the dagger and mace as his/her only\nweapons, and access to the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water.\nThe elements of Energy and Spirit are also available for a cost.\n\nSee also: 'element earth' 'element air' 'element fire'\n          'element water' 'element spirit' 'element energy'\n\n~\n\n-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' ~\nMages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.\nMages have the highest-powered magic of any class.  They are also very\nskilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the \nweakest of any class.\n\nAll mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be\npurchased, at a very high rate.\n\nSee 'help mage default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' ~\nClerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their\nspells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells\nbeing far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best \nclass by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of\nprotective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.\n\nAll clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must\nbe purchased, many at a very dear cost.\n\nSee 'help cleric default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' ~\nThieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,\nbut have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at\nthievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where\nmore powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than\nclerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.\n\nAll thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as \nwell.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection\nis chosen.  \n\nSee 'help thief default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' ~\nWarriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters\nof all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical\ntalents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind\ntaking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.\n\nWarriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.\nOther weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill\npackage.\n\nSee 'help warrior default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~\nEach weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how\nwell a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group\nprovides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.\nIf the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.\nThe chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at \nboth his weapon and his opponent's.\n\nThe weapon skills consist of the following:\n\nweaponsmaster skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)\naxe   the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)\ndagger    the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons\nflail   skill in ball-and-chain type weapons\nmace    this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces\npolearm   the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds\nspear   this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms\nsword   the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore\nwhip    the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips\nexotic    the use of strange magical weapons\n\nThe exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.\n~\n\n-1 ATTACK~\nThe attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy\nrather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful\nthan the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and \nthieves cannot use this group.

They are:\n\nBless              - Grants bonuses to a person or object\nCurse              - Grants negatives to a person or object\nFeast              - feed your hunger\nFamine             - cause you to be hungry\nPassdoor           - ability to walk through some doors\nSanctuary          - protective shield around the body\nWord of Recall     - return to a point of recall\n\n(Note: This group costs 15 cp as opposed to the standard 12)\n\n~\n\n\n-1 BEGUILING~\nThis insideous spell group is used to invade the minds of others.  It consists\nof various charming magics, well suited for turning your foes to your cause.\nOnly mages and thieves have access to the beguiling magics, which consist of\nthe following:\n\ncalm            if successful, stops all fighting in the room\ncharm person  turns an enemy into a trusted friend\nsleep   puts a foe into enchanted slumber\n~\n\n-1 BENEDICTIONS~\nBenedictions are priestly spells, used to bestow divine favor upon your allies.\nThey are often restricted to those of like alignment.  Only clerics and \nwarriors may use these spells.  The benedictions spell group consists of the\nfollowing:\n\nfeast   fills the belly of the intended target\nbless   bestows divine favor upon the target\ncalm    if successful, stops all fighting in the room\nfrenzy    puts the recipient into beserker rage\nholy word aids your allies while calling divine wrath upon your foes\nremove curse  removes malevolent magic from players and items\n~\n\n-1 PIETY~\nPiety are the spells of Paladins, used to smite those who are not beleivers\nof your deity.  The piety spell group consists of:\n\nbless  bestows divine favor upon the target\ncurse  leaves the victim without divine assistance\ncrusade  at a cost to your sacrifices lowers the value of target's sacrifices\nholy silence  cuts off all in the room's communication with their deity\nsee soul  know the alignment and deity of the target\nindulgence  your alignment will not change due to your actions\n~\n\n-1 COMBAT~\nThese sorcerous spells are, in the words of one famous mage, just 'more ways to\ntoss energy around'.  They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and\nconsidered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves\ndo not have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group\ncontains the following magics:\n\nmagic missile send a weak energy bolt into a foe\nchill touch weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp\nburning hands sends a blast of fire into your foe\nshocking grasp  sends a powerful jolt into a foe\nlightning bolt  sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy\ncolour spray  blasts your opponent with a rainbow spray, which may blind him\nfireball  a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes\nacid blast  sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes\nchain lightning sends lightning bolts arcing through foes \n~\n\n-1 CREATION~\nThe creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent\nduration.  Skill creators can travel without food or drink, and use their \npowers to create nourishment as required.  All classes may become learned in\nthis group, which contains these spells:\n\ncontinual light creates an eternal light source\ncreate food produces a nourishing mushroom\ncreate rose creates a beautiful red rose\ncreate spring calls forth a small but pure spring from the ground\ncreate water  fills any available container with water\nfloating disc creates a floating disc of force perfect for hauling treasure\nwarp          changes the size of armor\n~\n\n-1 CURATIVE~\nThe curative spells are used to heal various unpleasant conditions that can\nbefall an adventurer.   For healing of damage, see the healing spell group.\nCurative spells cannot be used by mages or thieves.\n\ncure blindness  restored sight to the blind\ncure disease  heals the plague\ncure poison removes the harmful effects of poison\n~\n\n-1 DETECTION~\nThe detection spells have may uses, all related to gathering information. They\ncan be used to see hidden objects, give information about treasure, or even\nscry out the true nature of your foe.  All classes except warriors can use \ndetection spells.\n\ndetect evil reveals the aura of evil monsters\ndetect good similar to above, only for good monsters\ndetect hidden shows the whereabouts of hidden foes\ndetect invis  allows the caster to see the unseeable\ndetect magic  reveals magical auras to the caster\ndetect poison determines if food is safe to eat\nfarsight  searches for living beings near the caster\nidentify  gives information about the nature of an object\nknow alignment  determines the moral character of a monster or person\nlocate object finds a specific item\n~\n\n-1 DRACONIAN~\nThe Draconian spell group deals with the magic of dragons -- in this case, \nbringing forth the devastating power of their breath weapons upon your foes.\nOnly mages have the mental training necessary to cast these spells, and few\nof them ever reach the level of mastery required to use them.\n\nacid breath  uses the black dragon's attack upon an enemy\nfire breath  calls forth the flames of a red dragon\nfrost breath   drains the life from a foe with the power a white dragon\ngas breath   suffocates your enemies with poison gas\nlightning breath summons the electrical fury of a blue dragon \n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTMENT~\nThe enchantment spell group is used to imbue items with magical properties.\nCurrently, this spell group consists of enchant weapon and enchant armor, \nalthough more will be added in the future.  Only mages may enchant.\n\nenchant weapon  increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon\nenchant armor increases the protective value of armor\nfireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nrecharge  restores power to a depleted wand or staff\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCEMENT~\nThe enhancement spells improve upon the body's pontential, allowing feats of\nsuperhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful\neffects upon the recipient.\n\ngiant strength  grants increased strength\nhaste   doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing\ninfravision allows monsters to be seen in the dark\nwarp        changes the size of armor\nrefresh   restores energy to tired adventurers\n~\n\n\n-1 HARMFUL~\nThis spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed\nto tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against\nitself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.\nIn order of power, the harmful spells are:\n\ncause light inflicts minor wounds on an enemy\ncause serious inflicts wounds on a foe\ncause critical  causes major damage to the target\nharm    the most deadly harmful spell\n~\n\n-1 HEALING~\nThe healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably\nsuffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the\ncurative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.\nIn order of power, the healing spells are:\n\ncure light  heals minor wounds\nrefresh   restores vigor to a tired adventurer\ncure serious  heals wounds\ncure critical closes all but the worst wounds\nheal    the most powerful healing spell\nmass healing  casts a heal spell on each player in the room\n~\n\n-1 ILLUSION~\nThe illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be\nused to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,\nthe illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.\nOnly thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the \nfollowing:\n\ninvis   turns the target invisible\nmass invis  turns the caster's group invisible\nventriloquate allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth\n\n~\n\n-1 MALADICTIONS~\nMaladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to\ncripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells\nmay be cast by any class.\n\nfamine   causes the victim to become ravenously hungry\nblindess  strikes the target blind\ncurse   prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat\nenergy drain  drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster\nplague    causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague\npoison    weaker than plague, but often fatal\nslow    slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack  \nweaken    drains the strength of the target\n~\n\n-1 PROTECTIVE~\nThe protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or\nphysical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after\nsanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling\nhostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following \nspells:\n\narmor   provides the target with an extra layer of defense\ncancellation  a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends\ndispel magic  removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel\nfireproof shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nprotection evil provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures\nprotection good protects from the attacks of good beings\nsanctuary reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half\nshield    puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies\nstoneskin turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost\n~\n\n-1 TRANSPORTATION~\nThe transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical\nteleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,\nwhich are among the most useful in the game.\n\nfly   allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles\ngate    transports the caster to the target\nnexus   forms a two-way portal to a far off destination\npass door allows the caster to walk through walls\nportal    creates a one-way portal to a destination\nsummon    transports the target to the caster\nteleport  sends the target to a random location\nword of recall  transports the caster to safety in Midgaard\n~\n\n-1 WEATHER~\nThese spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well\nas summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is\nusable by all classes.\n\ncall lightning  summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right\ncontrol weather changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster\nfaerie fire surrounds the target in a glowing aura\nfaerie fog  reveals all hidden creatures in the room\nlightning bolt  sends a bolt of electricity into the target\n\n(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)\n~\n\n-1 BACKSTAB~\nBackstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It \ncan be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.\nThe damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his\nweapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.\n~\n\n-1 BASH~\nThe bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock\nyour foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the\nbash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon\nis not generally a wise idea.\n~\n\n-1 THROW THROWS~\nThe throw skill is a samurai talent.  In a single deft movement the samurai's\nvictim is flipped and thrown to the ground putting them into a daze.\n~\n\n-1 KAILINDO~\nAn anceint martial arts skill, kailindo is the art of blocking and striking.\n~\n\n-1 BERSERK~\nOnly powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage\nin combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge\nsurge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  \nBerserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.\n~\n\n-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~\nConsider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever \ncombatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The\nblindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity\nhelps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may\nlearn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 GAROTTE~\nThis skill is the art of choking your opponent into unconsciousness using\na wire or rope with handles on the ends as a weapon.  These weapons are\ngenerally useless for any other purpose.  Success depends on suprising the\nvictim.  This skill is available only to assassins.\n~\n\n-1 DISARM~\nDisarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your\nopponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you\nare skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves\nand warriors may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 DODGE~\nIn the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not\nbe where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the\ncharacter's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the \ntarget. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the\nattacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.\n~\n\n-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~\nWarriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are\nable to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked\nfor with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus\nis very low indeed.\n~\n\n-1 ENVENOM~\nThe envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to\nwin a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.\nOr, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.\nFood, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned\nfood or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to\nbe more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could\ndrink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on\nthe other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison \nburns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates \nquickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.\n~\n\n-1 'HAND TO HAND'~\nHand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this\nstyle of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.\nTrained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.\nClerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages\nmay also learn it.\n~\n\n-1 KICK~\nKicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful\nkick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters\nand clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn\nit.\n~\n\n-1 PARRY~\nIf at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting \nattacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for\nfull success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced\ndamage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the\ndefender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.\n~\n\n-1 RESCUE~\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with\nthe rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede\nin combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the\nfavor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as\nwell as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and\nthe target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)\n~\n\n-1 TRIP~\nBack by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves\nusing any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.\nTripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will\nfind the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.\n~\n\n-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~\nTraining in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes\nin combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every\nround.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a \nvery hard time with it.\n~\n\n-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~\nTraining in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike\nin a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect\nthird attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly\nskilled thieves may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 HIDE SNEAK~\nHide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.\nHide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the\ncharacter remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to\nsneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and\nthieves may learn these skills.\n~\n\n-1 'FAST HEALING'~\nThe fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,\nor sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general \ntoughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is \npossible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it\nvery difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.\n~\n\n-1 LORE~\nLore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use\nof the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,\nconcerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value\nof an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may\nlearn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard\nto use.\n~\n\n-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~\nHaggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to\nmatch wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,\nor to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are \nalready very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best \nguard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, \nalthough other classes may learn it as well.\n~\n\n-1 PEEK~\nThe peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,\nthe better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are\nharder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most\ncommon practicioners.\n~\n\n-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~\nLock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain\naccess to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  \nintelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may\nlearn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.\n~\n\n-1 COMMUNION~\nA skill unique to clerics, the communion skill allows the cleric to convert\nhis or her past offerings to his/her deity into hit points or mana.  The\nuse of communion is automatic, and is done when the cleric attempts to\ncast a spell without having enough mana, or is attacked and does not have\nenough hit points to survive the hit.\n~\n\n-1 MEDITATION~\nThis skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and\nmantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.\nThieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have\nmuch trouble learning to meditate.\n~\n\n-1 CHI~\nThis skill is the art of controling your life force.  When control total\ncontrol of your chi is acheived movement costs can be cut in half.\n~\n-1 'DETECT GOOD' 'DETECT EVIL'~\nSyntax: cast 'detect good'\n        cast 'detect evil' \n\t\nThese spells enable the caster to detect good and evil characters. Good \nreveals a golden aura and Evil reveals a red aura. Casting of either of\nthese spell will reveal both good and evil, it is not necessary to cast\nboth upon yourself.\n~\n\n-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~\nSyntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>\n \nDispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on \nthe pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their\nperil.\n~\n\n\n-1 'RECHARGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'recharge' <item>\n\nThe recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.\nFully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell\nis proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be\nrecharged one time successfully.\n~\n\n-1 'DEMONFIRE'~\nSyntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>\n\nDemonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those\nwho follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to \ninflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.\n~\n\n-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>\n\nRay of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth\na beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants\nof evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike \ncasters who are tainted by evil.\n~\n\n-1 'PORTAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'portal' <target>\n\nThe portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal\nto the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are\nentered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot\nbe made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.\nPortal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the\nsecret of this material component has been lost...\n~\n-1 'SHARPEN'~\nSyntax: sharpen 'weapon'\n\nSharpen is an inate ability that all dwarves know how to do.  It allows \nthem to place a sharper edge on a bladed weapon for a time.\nSharpen requires a special type of stone be used in order to work properly.\n\n                    WARNING WARNING WARNING\n\nThere is a very real chance that attempting to sharpen a weapon will \nDESTROY the weapon.  Dwarves learn with age how to avoid damaging weapons\nand causing anguish. \n~\n\n-1 'NEXUS'~\nSyntax: cast 'nexus' <target>\n\nThis spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the\nonly difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus \nspell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered\nportal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret\nof which has been lost...\n~\n\n-1 'HEAT METAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>\n\nHeat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary \naccording to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment\n(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,\ncausing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the\nprocess (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).\nThis spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY WORD'~\nSyntax: cast 'holy word'\n\nHoly word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with\ndisasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful\nblessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the\nroom are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of\nopposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)\nare struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers\ngreatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and \ndrained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.\n~\n\n-1 FRENZY~\nSyntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>\n\nThe frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing\nhis or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine\nwrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, \nmaking the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm\nspell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's \nalignment.\n~\n\n-1 CALM~\nSyntax: cast 'calm' \n\nOne of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is\nthe calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed\ncreatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage\nin combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence \nactivity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --\neither all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who\nare immune to magic) or none is.\n~\n\n-1 HASTE~\nSyntax: cast 'haste' <target>\n\nThe haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing\nan extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive\nabilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,\nsuch that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating\nthe slow spell. (see 'help slow').\n~\n\n-1 FEAST~\nSyntax: cast 'feast' <target>\n\nThe 'feast' spell is sort of like casting a magic mushroom inside of\nthe belly of your intended target.  Feast will fill up any creature, be\nit living, dead, or undead.  There are times, however, when a given\ncreature doesn't -wish- to be full.  If the victim has 'nocancel' enabled,\nhe or she will receive a saving throw versus the feast spell.\n~\n\n-1 FAMINE~\nSyntax: cast 'famine' <target>\n\nThe 'famine' spell is the antithesis of the 'feast' spell.  It drains\nsustenance from the target, leaving him or her in need of water and \nfood, or whatever else it is the victim thrives off of.  Although the\n'famine' spell is offensive, there are creatures who have a need to be\nhungry.  Hence, if you attempt to cast 'famine' on yourself, you'll always\nsucceed.\n~\n\n-1 SLOW~\nSyntax: cast 'slow' <target>\n\nDespite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell\nwith it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,\nit slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate\nof attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing\nrates, due to reduced metabolism.\n~\n\n-1 PLAGUE~\nSyntax: cast 'plague' <target>\n\nThe plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,\nsapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to\ndeath.

They are completely\nincharge of the necromantic spells.  Players who take this kit gain one\nnew spell (wraithform) and an innate ability (vampiric touch).\nNecromancers gain bonuses for being evil when they cast necromantic \nspells. If a necromancer is not living up to their alignment expectations,\nthey suffer a penality when casting necromantic spells.\nBecause they live an evil life, their alignment will not drop\nwhen these spells are cast.\nNecromancers are also very creepy, so they do not cast beguiling spells\nvery well.  \n\nsee also:  vampiric touch\nsee also:  wraithform\n\n~\n0 WRAITHFORM~\n\nsyntax:  c 'wraithform'\n\nBy casting this spell, the necromancer is turned into a wraith like mist.\nBecause they are made of mist, they are limited in thier actions.  \nLikewise, there is very little on this world that can affect someone in\nwraithform.\nThe necromancer *MUST* leave wraithform before the duration of the spell\nhas worn out, or they will die.

Write a note to coders explaining \nyour need, also mention vnums for these itemparts and endproduct so recipe \ncan be coded.  \nAfter you receive the recipe numbers from coders, you can place them into \nvalue0-4 (v0-v4) in forge (so you can have max. 5 different recipes in one \nforge). \n\nFor more complicated forging, You may request skill to be placed into \nrecipe that is taken into account when mortal forges your items. \nFor example: itempart1 and itempart2 is forged into endproduct in \nforge, if mortal has bleed skill he succeeds to create new item. But \nif anyone else but nosferatu tries to forge anything with these items, \nthey just dissolve from the forge leaving nothing behind.\n\nBelow is an example that is to be in the recipes.are file\n#22                      - recipe number\nnoskill 0                - skill and percent needed\n10741                    - vnum of the forge\n10716                    - vnum of the item to be created \n10457 15234 20764 111 0  - vnums of the components (upto five)\n\n\n~\n0 FORGE~\nUsage: forge <forge container>\n\n    Certain items in the game can be placed in a \"forge container\"\nand \"forged\" into a new item.  These items are part of a recipe that\nan Immortal has created, and may include any item(s) in the game.\nThere is a forge currently in the Armor Shop in Midgaard.\n\nThere may or may not be a skill requirement that needs to be met in\norder to forge sucessfully.  There is no way for you to know if this\nis the case.\n\nImmortals:  see the VFORGE helpfile\n~\n\n-1 GRENADE~\nSyntax: grenade <grenade> <target>\n\n   All classees are equally capable of using grenade weapons.

No, you don't understand.\nThey *REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like dragons, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-lizard sentiment.  The Wyrmslayer spends his or her\nlife dedicated to the destruction of dragons, and so all Wyrmslayers are\ngiven {Cdagger{x and {Cspear{x, just to make sure they've got the tools of\nthe trade.  On top of that, Wyrmslayers are expert at getting their weapons\nthrough those damned dragon scales, and getting their spells past the\ndragon's natural magical resistance.  Due to their extreme hatred of dragons,\nthe Wyrmslayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal damage to the\nlizards.  This is not a special skill, but an inate ability that depends\nsolely on the Wyrmslayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BUFFY SLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-remort\n\n    Slayers really don't like undead.  No, you don't understand. They \n*REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like remorts, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-dead-guy sentiment.  Due to their extreme hatred \nof remorts, the Slayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal \ndamage to the undead.  This is not a special skill, but an inate \nability that depends solely on the Slayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BISHOP~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Paladin Crusader\n\n    The Bishop is a leader, and supreme spellcaster.  They do not cast\ntheir spells, they access their magic through the use of the {Choly chant{x.\nBishops receive enhanced mana gains, and have the ability to cast all of their\nspells while in combat.  Bishops also receive an extra 100 sac points, and\ncast their spells as a slight reduction in mana cost.\n\nNOTE: All Bishops should save at least two practices for 'holy chant' if \nthey wish to avoid being crippled in the spellcasting arena.\n\nSEE ALSO:  'holy chant'\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY CHANT' CHANT~\nSyntax: chant <spell> <target>\n\n    The chant command is used exactly like the 'cast' command.  The major\ndifference is that the Bishop has a skill percentage with 'chant', and  it\nis checked before he can cast a spell.  This means that Bishops have two skills\nthat must be at an adequate level: 'holy chant', and the spell being chanted.\nIt is advised that all Bishops save at least two practices for 'holy chant'\nbefore they take this kit.\n~\n\n-1 NINJA~\nAvailable to:  Thief Assassin Rogue\n\n    The ninja is the ultimate stealth machine, specializing in two unique\nabilities.  {CNinjitsu{c, and {CKurijitsu{x.

Prophets are the specially chosen ones, who communicate most \nclearly and directly to their gods.  Consequently, they have the ability\nto call upon their faith to {Cimbue{x themselves with enhanced spellcasting\nabilities.  Furthermore, due to their closeness to their deities, Prophets\nreceive an extra practice any time they level.  Finally, Prophets improve\ntheir skills much more quickly than others through manual practice.\n\nSEE ALSO: imbue\n~\n\n-1 IMBUE~\nSyntax: cast 'imbue'\n\n    The 'imbue' spell is a special part of the Prophet kit, and raises the\nProphet's casting level.  The amount of the raise depends on the Prophet's\nclass.\n~\n\n-1 VINDICATOR~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Crusader\n               All races\n\n    The Vindicator is the most militant of religious figures, with a hardy\nframe, and a strong swordarm.  Vindicators are combat-oriented, and tough,\nnot to mention well atuned to the aspets of their gods that provide them  \nwith the most strength: anger.  Vindicators are the only clerics that  \nreceive the {Cthird attack{x skill, and also have the ability to cast a \nunique spell that invokes the {Cwrath{x of their gods.\n\nSEE ALSO: wrath\n~\n\n-1 WRATH~\nSyntax: cast 'wrath' <victim>\n\n\tThe spiritual Wrath of the gods can be invoked and cast upon\nanybody (barring clan/non-clan restrictions) at the will of the \nVindicator.  The spell has the potential to do enormous damage, even more\nso if used succesfully multiple times.  The lingering anger of the gods\nleaves a taint on the victim that can be used to double the damage of this\npowerful spell on the next succesful casting.  The Vindicator must be in\ngood standing with his or her deity for this spell to have its maximum\neffect.\n\n~\n\n-1 BARBARIAN~\nAvailable to:  Warrior Berzerker\n               All races\n\n   The Barbarian is a primal warrior, with brute strength and carnal\nrage as his primary offensive weapons.  Because of this, the Barbarian\nhas two special abilities, {Cendurance{x, and the powerful {Cbarbarian\nrage{x.  Both fit into the Barbarian's style of \"hurt now, ask questions\nlater, if there's anything left to interrogate.\"\n~\n\n-1 ENDURANCE~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The Endurance skill causes the barbarian to take less damage when he is \ninjured.  This includes weapon and magical damage, and it even will reduce\ndamage taken from attacks like backstabs, bites, and damage types that the\nbarbarian is vulnerable too.  The amount of reduction is random, but it can\nbe as high as 30%.\n~\n\n-1 'BARBARIAN RAGE'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The barbarian's rage is a unique type of berserk attack.  It kicks in\nautomatically.  The longer the barbarian has been in combat, the better\nthe chances are of the rage starting up.  Also, the longer the barbarian\nis in combat, the more potent the rage in when it finally does kick in.\nBecause the barbarian is a brute force combatant, he sacrafices some\nregard for personal safety while using the rage, and his AC will suffer.\n~\n\n-1 POQUAH PROWLER~\nPoquah and Prowler... Can't get much smoother than this. Now you know where\nthe 'Roxbury' social comes from.\n~\n\n-1 'KIT'~\n\nQ. What is a 'kit'?\nA. A kit is a special collection of new game mechanics and/or abilities that\nare available to specific classes.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of taking a kit?\nA. You receive special, unique abilities like new skills or spells, and you\nhave a secret card to play in the pkill game, since no one can tell what kit\nyou have.\n\nQ. What is the downside?\nA. You -must- pay practices to take a kit, there is no other way to get one.\n\nQ. Which kits are available for my class?\nA. See 'help kit list'.\n\nQ. Can I take multiple kits?\nA. Sort of.  If you take a kit, you get its skills/spells, but if you change\nkits later, you loose any of that kit's skills and special abilities.  For\nexample, if you take the 'enchanter' kit, and then later switch to another kit\nyou will loose your old enchanting abilities.\n\nQ. Can I trade my kit back in for the practices I spent on it?\nA. No.  Once you take a kit, you are irrevocably stuck with it.\n\nQ. How do I accept a kit?\nA. Type 'kit take <name>'\n\nQ. It says 'huh' when I type 'kit'!\nA. You must be at least level 10 to take a kit.\n\nQ. It says I don't have good enough attributes!\nA. Your -natural- attributes have to meet the minimum required for the kit.\n\nQ. How do I tell what the minimums are?\nA. Type 'kit info <name>'\n\nQ. If I remort, do I loose my kit?\nA. No, unless you were a remort hunter and remort :).  You will be out the\n   100 pracs.  Now, remorts CAN take a remort hunter kit, as long as the \n   kit does not hunt their type of remort.\n\nQ. If I reclass, do I loose my kit?\nA. Yes.\n\n~\n\n0 SHAMAN~\n\n   Shamans are tribal witch doctors, primitive practicioners of arcane magicks.\nTheir speciality is the practice of gradually and painfully killing their enemies.\nShamans are experts as inflicting disease upon people, and as such, are the primary\nusers of 'damage over time' spells.  Shaman DOT spells are the most powerful DOTs\nin the game, and can inflict hundreds of points of damage to a target.\n\n   Shamans have access to the 'disease' spell group, which contains four disease-\nbased DOT spells.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'damage over time' 'disease'\n~\n\n0 DISEASE~\nDisease Spell Group - Shaman Kit Only\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDamage Cap Level\n    \tLevel 18\tContagion\t\t35\n\tLevel 28\tBlight\t\t\t40\n\tLevel 38\tBoiling Blood\t\t45\n\tLevel 48\tScourge\t\t\t50\n\n\tThe four weapons of the Disease spell group.  Each does some damage when\ncast, and some recurring damage over the next few minutes.  Scourge lasts the\nlongest of these.  All of these spells have an effective level cap at which the\namount of damage they do ceases to increase with level.  Note that saving throws\nversus these spells are still done against the ACTUAL casting level of the caster.\nBut the affect caps at the above levels.  The spells cannot be cancelled.  The\nmedics of Midgaard have yet to devise a way to cure these diseases.\n\n\tAll cost 75 mana and have a 2-round delay.  Experienced victims of these\nspells have indicated that the further they get from the caster, the less damage\nthe spells do.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'shaman' 'damage over time'\n~\n\n-1 'KIT LIST'~\n\n KIT             AVAILABILTY\nAcrobat\t\tThief Rogue Assassin Monk\nAlchemist\tMage Wizard\nArcheologist    Any (except Remorts)\nBarbarian\tWarrior Berzerker\nBattlerager\tWarrior Cleric Crusader (Dwarf Only)\nBishop\t\tCleric Crusader Paladin\nBladesinger\tWarrior Blademaster Mage Wizard (Elf Only) \nBrawler  \tWarrior Thief Berzerker Samurai Rogue Blademaster\nBuffy\t\tAny (except Remorts)\nCavalier        Warrior Paladin Samurai\nEnchanter\tMage Wizard\nFence           Rogue Thief Assassin\nKnight\t\tWarrior Blademaster Cleric Paladin\nLycanthrope \n  Hunter        Any (except Remorts)\nMedium          Mage Cleric Monk Druid Elementalist Wizard Crusader\nMyrmidon\tWarrior Blademaster (except yinns)\nNature Friend\tDruid\nNecromancer     Mage Wizard\nNethermancer\tMage Wizard\nNinja\t\tThief Rogue Assassin\nProphet \tCleric Crusader Paladin Monk\nRanger\t\tWarrior Thief Rogue Blademaster\nScribe          Mage Wizard Cleric\nShaman\t\tMage Wizard Cleric Crusader\nShapeshifter\tDruid Elementalist\nSpirit Caller   Druid\nShadow Stalker  Thief Rogue\nStaff Crafter   {YDRUID{x Cleric Crusader\nSummoner\tElementalist\nVampyre Hunter  Any (Except Remorts)\nVindicator\tCleric Crusader\nWand Maker      Mage Wizard\nWarlock\t\tMage Wizard (Male Only)\nWitch\t\tMage Wizard (Female Only)\nWu Jen\t\tMage Monk Samurai\nWyrmslayer\tAny (except dragons)\n\n\nSome suggestions that you needn't bother with:\n    Do not suggest 'balance' things (\"If class X has 6 options, so should\n    class Y!\"  \"If there is a dwarf-only kit there should be a faerie-only\n    kit too!\").  Do not suggest overly specific things.  A 'knight' kit\n    would be ok.  A 'yinnish knight' or 'elven archer' or 'elf scribe' is\n    too specific.  Complaining about the availability of a given kit will not\n    get you anywhere.  Neither will complaining about the lack of kits for\n    a given race or class.  We add them as we can.  \n\nThe following are ideas being considered for future kits.\n\n~\n\n-1 'RACE HELP' 'RACE' 'RACES'~\nMHS has the following races for player characters:\n \n Race       Size     CP  Specialities\n Human      Medium    5  none \n Dwarf      Medium    9  Warrior, Cleric\n Elf        Small    14  Mage, Thief\n Half-Elf   Medium    8  none\n Giant \t    Huge      5  Warrior\n Volare     Medium   10  Cleric\n Kender     Small     6  Thief\n Dragon     Huge     31  Everything\n Lasher     Large    14  Warrior\n Ogre       Large    11  Warrior\n Goblin     Medium    9  Mage\n Yinn       Large    23  Everything\n Rockbiter  Gigantic 16  Unknown\n Gargoyle   Medium   6   Unknown\n Faerie     Tiny     13  Magic\n Mutant     Varies   30  Impossible to say\n\nDifferent races have different starting statistics, and also different\nstat maximums for magic items and training.\n\nSee individual help files for each race for informatino about special\nabilities and resists/vulnerabilities.\n\nCreation points increase the amount of experience it takes to gain a level.\nFor more information, see the help files for each race (i.e. 'help dwarf')\n~\n\n-1 'VAMPYRE HUNTER'~\nThe vampyre hunter specializes in hunting nosferatu.

REMEMBER, this is something to do if you get bored at level \n51.  It is NOT intended to make you necessarily better than anyone else, \njust different.  If remorts are \"better\" then they deserve it.\n\n{WPeople who remort and have the vampyre hunter, archeologist, or \nlycanthrope hunter kit will have the kit stripped.

You\nwill be more vulnerable to weapons made of a certain material. A Mummy\nis naturally no the best mover, so they receive less moves per level.\n\nFor more information on Remorts, see HELP REMORT.\n~\n\n-1 GOBLIN~\nGoblins are a mutant race, decended long ago from humans.  They\nare slightly more nimble than humans but a bit less hearty.  Goblins\nhave glowing red eyes and due to their awful diets are resistant\nto disease and poison.  Suprisingly they make better spellcasters \nthan they do fighters.  \n\n~\n-1 LASHER~\nLashers are a race of demonic beings. Born in heavens and cast down to seed\nfrom storms they are ill-suited to any particular class. With high strength\nand stamina they are quite resiliant so they get fast healing and meditation\nfor free and being born of the storm are resistant to the damage of lightning\nand fire. However, been cast down from the heavens they are quite vulnerable \nto the powers of light.\n~\n\n-1 DWARF DWARVES~\nDwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul temper and great\nstamina.  Dwarves have high strength and constitution, but poor dexterity.\nThey are not as smart as humans, but are usually wiser due to their long \nlifespans.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor\nmages or thieves. \n\nDwarves are very resistant to poison, disease, and certian magics.  They\ncannot swim, and so are very vulnerable to drowning.  All dwarves receive\nberserk and sharpen regardless of class and can see in the dark with\ninfravision.\n~ \n0 DRAG~\nSyntax: drag <victim> <direction>\n        drag <object> <direction>\n\nYou can drag an object from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The object must be either\na takeable or a draggable object.\n\nYou can drag a person from one room to another, assuming\nyou have the moves to do so. The person must be in a prone\nposition of some sort and can not be an aggressive monster.\nAnyone can drag monsters around. Only Clanners can drag\nother players around, and then only other clanners.\n~\n\n-1 DRAGON DRAGONS~\nDragons are those big scaley creatures. They may become very powerful as \nthey grow.  They have infrared vision and fly naturally.  They receive \nenhanced damage, and hand to hand combat skills for free, and naturally \ntheir breath is dangerous.  They are very costly to play in both time \nspent and experience needed as a trade off to their power. \n~\n\n-1 GARGOYLE~\nGargoyles are unliving animated stone creatures.  They are born of the\nnight, and as such, they suffer damage during the sunlight as remorts\ndo.  Gargoyles cannot escape this torment, even when indoors.  During\nthe night, Gargoyles gain resistance to some types of damage.  But\nduring the day, that resistance becomes a vulnerability.  They are\nmedium sized and can excel at any class.  They can fly, see in the\ninfrared spectrum, and have an inate ability to see invisible.\n~\n\n-1 ROCKBITER~\nRockbiters are gigantic creatures who are made of and thrive off of \nrocks and minerals.  They are the largest of all the races, and are \nthick and resiliant.  Their major weakness is that they are slow\nof movement.  Although their minds are relatively keen, they are\nprone to fall victim to mental attacks.  Although they are not very\nwise when young, they gain wisdom with age.\n~\n\n-1 FAERIES~\nFaeries are tiny little winged creatures, with great vision and perception.\nThey can all fly, see in the dark, and even detect invisible and hidden\ncreatures.  They are the best spellcasters of any of the races in terms\nof sheer magical prowess, but they have horrible strength and low hit points.\nThey are difficult to maladict, but they are incredibly agile and dodge\nbetter than any other race.  They also receive the dodge skill for free.\n~\n\n-1 MUTANTS~\nMutants are a unique race of unstable beings.  They have a natural form that\nvaguely resembles humans, but they will, at random times, mutate into other\nraces.  When they mutate, they take on the resistances, vulnerabilities,\nsize, and special characteristics of that race.  Their maximum attributes\nchange as well.  Mutants may learn skills unique to a given race, and retain\nthat knowledge long after they've changed to something else.  They have no \ncontrol over what they become.  Note that mutants will also change their CP\ndepending on what race they turn into, and will spend the overwhelming majority\nof their time with smaller CP than the mutant race naturally has.  This is not\na race for the impatient or inexperienced.  Your results will vary wildly from\nthose of other mutants.\n~\n\n-1 ELF ELVES~\nElves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They\nlack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,\nboth in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at\nbest fair talent as warriors or priests.\n\nElves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.\nBecause they are notoriously hard to spot, and so all elves, regardless of \nclass, may use sneak and hide.\n~\n\n-1 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALF~\nHalf-elves are decendents of the Elven race, yet along the way, they\nstrayed from the pure path of Elven lineage to persue true happiness\noutside their blood.  Half-elves are decendent, in majority, from\nhumans and elves.  Due to this, they are quite balanced, nearly\nexact, between the human, and that of the elf.  They have the ability\nto sneak like an elf, with their lithe bodies (if capable to do so),\nbut they have also learned to strengthen themselves, healing quickly\nas a natural ability.  They also have the ability to see in the dark\nlike their forefather elves.\n~\n\n-1 VOLARE~\nVolare are a race of angelic creatures, decended from the heavens from\nthe eyes of Mojo.  As he wept, they were created.  Volare, being good\nof nature, resist the powers of light, while are crippled by the powers\nof darkness.  With their natural abilities, they were given the nature\nto help mortals through creation, cures, and defend themselves through\ncombat.\n~\n\n-1 YINN~\n   The Yinn are a race of bipedal canines.  They hail from a frigid area\nof ice and storms, and so are resistant to cold and electricity.  However,\nlittle is known of their weakness, save that they do not like heat due\nto their natural climate, and area of origin.  They are a fairly intellegent\nrace, with an internal code of discipline and honor.  Even still, they have\nshort tempers, and quick swords, and do not hesitate to solve a problem\nthrough combat.  Yinn excel at most anything they do.  They are quite\nvicious.\n~\n\n-1 KENDER~\nKender are related to elves but with slightly higher strength, dexterity\nand constitution.  They lack a bit in wisdom and significantly in\nintelligence.  They are born thieves, too fidgety for other professions.\nBeing so so nimble they get the dodge skill for free and are resistant\nto being bashed.  Being so tiny they are more vulnerable to cold and\npoison.\n~\n\n-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~\nHumans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of\nadventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,\nthey are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may\nalso train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to\ngain more benefit from magical devices.\n~\n\n-1 OGRE OGRES~\nOgres are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Ogres make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nOgres resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Ogres,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only ogre warriors recive bash).\n\nThrough the years of combat,rage of fighting and pillaging, Ogres have learned\nthe scent of death.\n~\n\n-1 GIANT GIANTS~\nGiants are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nGiants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only giant warriors recive bash).\n~\n\n-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~\nMagical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the\nnecessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The\nitem skills are as follows:\n\nscrolls   The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')\nstaves    The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')\nwands   The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') \n~\n \n-1 'GROUP HEADER'~\nThe following skills and groups are available to your chacter:\n(this list may be seen again by typing list)\n{YNOTE:{x  The more skills you add, the higher your creation points will \n           be.  The higher your CP the more experience you will need to\n           level.  \n~\n\n-1 'GROUP HELP'~\nThe following commands are available:\nlist         display all groups and skills not yet bought\nlearned      show all groups and skills bought \npremise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups\nadd <name>   buy a skill or group\ndrop <name>  discard a skill or group\ninfo <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group\nhelp <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics\ndone       exit the character generation process\n~\n\n-1 'MENU CHOICE'~\nChoice (add,drop,list,help)?~\n\n-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~\nThe MHM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making\nhim or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick\nat character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are \npaid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the\nharder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to\npractice.\n\nSkill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells\nthat are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a \ndefault skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced \nselection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.\n\nThe experience breakdown is as follows: \npoints   exp/level     points   exp/level\n40        1000         90        6000\n50        1500         100       8000\n60    2000         110      12000\n70        3000         120      16000 \n80        4000         130      24000\nThe table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.\n~\n\n-1 BASICS 'MHS BASICS'~\nThe basic skills:\n\nEvery character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default\nset that all characters receive.  The default skills are:\n\nrecall    essential escape skill (see help recall)\nscrolls   reading of scrolls and other magical volumes\nstaves    use of magical staves\nwands   use of magical wands\nscan      checking who is in the area\nswimming  swimming through traverable water\n\nfor class defaults, check the classes themselves.\n~\n\n-1 DRUID DRUIDS~\nDruids specialize in the control of magic in all it's forms.  They\nbecome more powerful with age.  They may gain all the spell groups\nclerics or mages may gain as well as the special ability to control\ndefensive orbs.\n~\n\n-1 ROGUES~\nRogues are the consummate theives of Boinga.  They have access to all the same\nskills as a thief, including steal and slice, and perform these skills with\ngreater ease than does a thief.  Rogues are also extremely difficult to detect\nand are very good at sneaking and hiding.  Rogues gain hp and mana the same as\na standard thief.\n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTER~\nThe Enchanter receives no new spells or skills, but (s)he is the absolute\nfinest enchanting mage in the realm.  The enchanter not only succeeds more\noften, but has the ability to do super-enchants, that are twice as good\nas even the impression 'brilliant' enchantments.\n~\n\n-1 BRAWLER~\n\n Brawlers are practiced at fighting multiple opponents.  Even while engaged\n in combat, they can switch the focus of their attacks to somebody else.  The\n do this through use of the \"attack\" command.  They can switch to either \n another person who is fighting them, or try to draw an idle third party into\n the fight.  This ability does not override pkill ranges, clan/non-clan status,\n or kill stealing code.\n\n~\n\n-1 WU JEN 'WU JEN'~\nPractitioners of the oriental magical arts, the Wu Jen specializes in\nself enhancement.  By {Wfocus{xing their mana to cast a spell they literally\ndamage themselves to increase the strength of the spell.  They can also\ncast 'enhance' on themselves to increase their vitals temporarily.\n\nSEE ALSO: enhance, focus\n~\n\n-1 FOCUS~\nSyntax: focus 'spell' <target>\n\nFocusing the user's mana increases the power of the spell at the expense of\ndamaging the caster.\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCE~\nSyntax: cast 'enhance'\n\nThe spell randomly increases one of the caster's vital stats temporarily.\nIt also damages the caster.\n~\n\n-1 SEER~\nThe Seer kit takes advantage of high intelligence and wisdom to give\nthe ability to cast 'farsee'.  The seer must know the world of Boinga\nwell and by name to take full advantage of their gift.\n\nSEE ALSO: farsee\n~\n\n-1 FARSEE~\nSyntax: cast 'farsee' victim\n\nIf sucessful the spell reveals the name of the room that the spell's\nvictim is in.  Sometimes a failure in the sight will inform the victim\nthat someone is searching for them.  Anyone may succeed on an NPC, but\nnon-clanners will not be able to use this spell on clanners. This is a\nmental attack type.\n~\n\n-1 ACROBAT~\nThe Acrobat kit combines quick reflexes with dexterity to create an agile\nand dangerous thief.  The acrobat is difficult to hit, and difficult to \nkeep in one place for very long.  Their ability to use the {Ctumbling{x\nskill provides them with a unique ability to avoid getting hit.\n\nSEE ALSO: {Ctumbling{x\n~\n\n-1 TUMBLING~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nTumbling is a special acrobat ability.  Tumbling increases the user's\ndodging ability, as well as permits him/her to roll out of the way of \nbashes, and even roll from a bash into a standing position.\n~\n\n-1 BLADEMASTERS~\nThe Blademaster is a double-warrior reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal warrior, and can specialize in any weapon group.  The\nBlademaster is ultra-accurate with his/her weapons, and is very difficult to\ndodge, parry, or block, and almost impossible to disarm.  However, the \nBlademasters has the unique ability to disarm a weapon and catch it.  They\nalso have access to the 'dual wield' skill.\n~\n\n-1 'DUAL WIELD'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nDual wield permits a Blademaster to use two different weapons at once, \nallowing for a strategic combinatino of special flags and damage types.\nTo use dual wield, the Blademaster simply wears two seperate weapons. \nThis skill -only- works while the Blademaster has two weapons.  If his or\nher primary weapon is somehow disarmed, he/she must wear another.  The\nsecondary weapon must be either exotic, or of the same weapon group as the\noriginal.  This combined with specialization makes for a powrful fighting\ncharacter in the Blademaster.  The secondary weapon must also be lighter\nthan the primary.  Finally, it is possible to use a sword-dagger combination.\n~\n-1 CRUSADE~\nThis spell is available only to those who know the piety spell group.  It\nallows you to call upon the power of your diety to drain a targets sacrifice\npoints.  However, the price of doing this is not cheap, an eye for an eye\nand all...\n~\n-1 HOLY SILENCE~\nHoly Silence cuts off the targets communication with thier diety.  \n~\n-1 SEE SOUL~\nSee Soul lets you peer into the deepest depths of a person, revealing thier\nalignment and diety.\n~\n-1 INDULGENCE~\nSpell: Indulgence\nA paladin affected by indulgence will not have their alignment change\neither by killing mobs, use of necromancy spells, or use of alignment\nchanging weapons.\n~\n-1 CRUSADERS~\nCrusaders are a double-cleric  reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal cleric, and access to all the same abilities, even the\ncoveted communion skill.  They also receive some extra spells:\n'hold person', 'endure heat' 'endure cold' 'bestow holiness' 'aid' and\n'sacred guardian'.\n~\n\n-1 SAMURAI SAMURAIS~\nSamurai are fighter mages.  They specialize in control of their body\nand using it to it's full potential.  As such they get and AC bonus on\narmor worn on body locations that normally do not receive bonuses.  They\ncan control their life energy, or 'chi', lowering their movement costs\nand they can master the art of throwing their opponent to the ground.\n~\n\n-1 MONK MONKS~\nMonks are thief clerics.  They specialize in special combat arts as well\nas issues of spirit and religion.  They are better able to defend\nthemselves and their AC is based on the weight of their armor, not it's\nstrength.  They are masters of kailindo, an anceint martial art.\n~\n\n-1 ELEMENTALIST~\n\nThe elementalist is a highly specialized mage.  Sacraficing the traditional\ntools of the trade, the elementalist has access to a handful of clerical\nspells, and an entire arsenal of new spells.  Like druids, Elementalists\ngrow in power as they age, their spells begin to have new effects and\nmore devestating results.  Their combat skills are marginal, but it is more\nthan made up for by a an impressive command of the world's natural forces.\n\nA default elementalist begins with the dagger and mace as his/her only\nweapons, and access to the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water.\nThe elements of Energy and Spirit are also available for a cost.\n\nSee also: 'element earth' 'element air' 'element fire'\n          'element water' 'element spirit' 'element energy'\n\n~\n\n-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' ~\nMages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.\nMages have the highest-powered magic of any class.  They are also very\nskilled at the use of magical items, though their combat skills are the \nweakest of any class.\n\nAll mages begin with skill in the dagger. Any other weapon skills must be\npurchased, at a very high rate.\n\nSee 'help mage default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' ~\nClerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their\nspells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells\nbeing far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best \nclass by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of\nprotective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.\n\nAll clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must\nbe purchased, many at a very dear cost.\n\nSee 'help cleric default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' ~\nThieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,\nbut have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at\nthievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where\nmore powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than\nclerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.\n\nAll thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as \nwell.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection\nis chosen.  \n\nSee 'help thief default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' ~\nWarriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters\nof all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical\ntalents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind\ntaking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.\n\nWarriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.\nOther weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill\npackage.\n\nSee 'help warrior default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~\nEach weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how\nwell a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group\nprovides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.\nIf the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.\nThe chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at \nboth his weapon and his opponent's.\n\nThe weapon skills consist of the following:\n\nweaponsmaster skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)\naxe   the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)\ndagger    the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons\nflail   skill in ball-and-chain type weapons\nmace    this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces\npolearm   the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds\nspear   this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms\nsword   the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore\nwhip    the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips\nexotic    the use of strange magical weapons\n\nThe exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.\n~\n\n-1 ATTACK~\nThe attack spells are essentially powerful curses, fueled by divine energy\nrather than magical power (like the combat spells are). They are less powerful\nthan the combat spells, but can still deal out a stinging blow.  Mages and \nthieves cannot use this group.  The attack spell group consists of the \nfollowing spells:\n\ndemonfire a powerful, but very evil, spell\ndispel evil torments evil foes\ndispel good calls down unholy power on good creatures\nearthquake  brings the power of earth to bear against your foes\nflamestrike sends a column of flame from the heavens\nheat metal  heats metal equipment to searing tempatures\nray of truth  sends forth a blinding ray of holy energy\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT AIR'~\n\nElement Air is a group comprised almost entirely of unique spells.\nThis group not only controls the element of air, but influences air-\nrelated phenomena, like weather.\n\nElectricsword   - create a Shocking affect on a weapon\nElectic Shield  - protect the Elementalist from Lightning \nFly             - permits the caster to soar through the air\nDust Storm      - summons forth a cloud of blinding dust\nWall of Wind    - brings the winds to knock people over\nTraveller's Fog - a mysterious transportive spell\nAsphyxiate\t- combusts the air in the victim's lungs\nThunderclap\t- a voilent blast of noise\nMistform\t- the caster becomes insubstantial like air\n\n~\n\n-1 'ELEMENT EARTH'~\n\nElement Earth is composed largely of unique spells.

They are:\n\nBless              - Grants bonuses to a person or object\nCurse              - Grants negatives to a person or object\nFeast              - feed your hunger\nFamine             - cause you to be hungry\nPassdoor           - ability to walk through some doors\nSanctuary          - protective shield around the body\nWord of Recall     - return to a point of recall\n\n(Note: This group costs 15 cp as opposed to the standard 12)\n\n~\n\n\n-1 BEGUILING~\nThis insideous spell group is used to invade the minds of others.  It consists\nof various charming magics, well suited for turning your foes to your cause.\nOnly mages and thieves have access to the beguiling magics, which consist of\nthe following:\n\ncalm            if successful, stops all fighting in the room\ncharm person  turns an enemy into a trusted friend\nsleep   puts a foe into enchanted slumber\n~\n\n-1 BENEDICTIONS~\nBenedictions are priestly spells, used to bestow divine favor upon your allies.\nThey are often restricted to those of like alignment.  Only clerics and \nwarriors may use these spells.  The benedictions spell group consists of the\nfollowing:\n\nfeast   fills the belly of the intended target\nbless   bestows divine favor upon the target\ncalm    if successful, stops all fighting in the room\nfrenzy    puts the recipient into beserker rage\nholy word aids your allies while calling divine wrath upon your foes\nremove curse  removes malevolent magic from players and items\n~\n\n-1 PIETY~\nPiety are the spells of Paladins, used to smite those who are not beleivers\nof your deity.

They are the most powerful of the damaging spells, and\nconsidered an essential part of most wizards' collections. Clerics and thieves\ndo not have access to these spells.  In order of power, the combat spell group\ncontains the following magics:\n\nmagic missile send a weak energy bolt into a foe\nchill touch weakens your enemy with a frigid grasp\nburning hands sends a blast of fire into your foe\nshocking grasp  sends a powerful jolt into a foe\nlightning bolt  sends forth a single bolt of lightning into an enemy\ncolour spray  blasts your opponent with a rainbow spray, which may blind him\nfireball  a powerful spell, great for burning your enemy to ashes\nacid blast  sends forth a stream of acid to eradicate your foes\nchain lightning sends lightning bolts arcing through foes \n~\n\n-1 CREATION~\nThe creation spell group is used to create objects, of temporary or permanent\nduration.

The harmful spells are designed\nto tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against\nitself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.\nIn order of power, the harmful spells are:\n\ncause light inflicts minor wounds on an enemy\ncause serious inflicts wounds on a foe\ncause critical  causes major damage to the target\nharm    the most deadly harmful spell\n~\n\n-1 HEALING~\nThe healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably\nsuffer in battle.

These spells\nmay be cast by any class.\n\nfamine   causes the victim to become ravenously hungry\nblindess  strikes the target blind\ncurse   prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat\nenergy drain  drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster\nplague    causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague\npoison    weaker than plague, but often fatal\nslow    slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack  \nweaken    drains the strength of the target\n~\n\n-1 PROTECTIVE~\nThe protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or\nphysical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after\nsanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling\nhostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following \nspells:\n\narmor   provides the target with an extra layer of defense\ncancellation  a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends\ndispel magic  removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel\nfireproof shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nprotection evil provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures\nprotection good protects from the attacks of good beings\nsanctuary reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half\nshield    puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies\nstoneskin turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost\n~\n\n-1 TRANSPORTATION~\nThe transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical\nteleportation, or walking through walls.

It \ncan be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.\nThe damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his\nweapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.\n~\n\n-1 BASH~\nThe bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock\nyour foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the\nbash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon\nis not generally a wise idea.\n~\n\n-1 THROW THROWS~\nThe throw skill is a samurai talent.  In a single deft movement the samurai's\nvictim is flipped and thrown to the ground putting them into a daze.\n~\n\n-1 KAILINDO~\nAn anceint martial arts skill, kailindo is the art of blocking and striking.\n~\n\n-1 BERSERK~\nOnly powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage\nin combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge\nsurge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  \nBerserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.\n~\n\n-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~\nConsider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever \ncombatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The\nblindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity\nhelps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may\nlearn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 GAROTTE~\nThis skill is the art of choking your opponent into unconsciousness using\na wire or rope with handles on the ends as a weapon.  These weapons are\ngenerally useless for any other purpose.  Success depends on suprising the\nvictim.  This skill is available only to assassins.\n~\n\n-1 DISARM~\nDisarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your\nopponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you\nare skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves\nand warriors may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 DODGE~\nIn the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not\nbe where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the\ncharacter's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the \ntarget. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the\nattacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.\n~\n\n-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~\nWarriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are\nable to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked\nfor with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus\nis very low indeed.\n~\n\n-1 ENVENOM~\nThe envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to\nwin a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.\nOr, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.\nFood, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned\nfood or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to\nbe more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could\ndrink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on\nthe other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison \nburns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates \nquickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.\n~\n\n-1 'HAND TO HAND'~\nHand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this\nstyle of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.\nTrained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.\nClerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages\nmay also learn it.\n~\n\n-1 KICK~\nKicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful\nkick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters\nand clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn\nit.\n~\n\n-1 PARRY~\nIf at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting \nattacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for\nfull success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced\ndamage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the\ndefender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.\n~\n\n-1 RESCUE~\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with\nthe rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede\nin combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the\nfavor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as\nwell as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and\nthe target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)\n~\n\n-1 TRIP~\nBack by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves\nusing any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.\nTripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will\nfind the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.\n~\n\n-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~\nTraining in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes\nin combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every\nround.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a \nvery hard time with it.\n~\n\n-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~\nTraining in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike\nin a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect\nthird attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly\nskilled thieves may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 HIDE SNEAK~\nHide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.\nHide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the\ncharacter remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to\nsneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and\nthieves may learn these skills.\n~\n\n-1 'FAST HEALING'~\nThe fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,\nor sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general \ntoughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is \npossible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it\nvery difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.\n~\n\n-1 LORE~\nLore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use\nof the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,\nconcerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value\nof an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may\nlearn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard\nto use.\n~\n\n-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~\nHaggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to\nmatch wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,\nor to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are \nalready very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best \nguard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, \nalthough other classes may learn it as well.\n~\n\n-1 PEEK~\nThe peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,\nthe better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are\nharder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most\ncommon practicioners.\n~\n\n-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~\nLock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain\naccess to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  \nintelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may\nlearn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.\n~\n\n-1 COMMUNION~\nA skill unique to clerics, the communion skill allows the cleric to convert\nhis or her past offerings to his/her deity into hit points or mana.  The\nuse of communion is automatic, and is done when the cleric attempts to\ncast a spell without having enough mana, or is attacked and does not have\nenough hit points to survive the hit.\n~\n\n-1 MEDITATION~\nThis skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and\nmantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.\nThieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have\nmuch trouble learning to meditate.\n~\n\n-1 CHI~\nThis skill is the art of controling your life force.  When control total\ncontrol of your chi is acheived movement costs can be cut in half.\n~\n-1 'DETECT GOOD' 'DETECT EVIL'~\nSyntax: cast 'detect good'\n        cast 'detect evil' \n\t\nThese spells enable the caster to detect good and evil characters. Good \nreveals a golden aura and Evil reveals a red aura. Casting of either of\nthese spell will reveal both good and evil, it is not necessary to cast\nboth upon yourself.\n~\n\n-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~\nSyntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>\n \nDispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on \nthe pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their\nperil.\n~\n\n\n-1 'RECHARGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'recharge' <item>\n\nThe recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.\nFully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell\nis proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be\nrecharged one time successfully.\n~\n\n-1 'DEMONFIRE'~\nSyntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>\n\nDemonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those\nwho follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to \ninflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.\n~\n\n-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>\n\nRay of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth\na beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants\nof evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike \ncasters who are tainted by evil.\n~\n\n-1 'PORTAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'portal' <target>\n\nThe portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal\nto the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are\nentered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot\nbe made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.\nPortal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the\nsecret of this material component has been lost...\n~\n-1 'SHARPEN'~\nSyntax: sharpen 'weapon'\n\nSharpen is an inate ability that all dwarves know how to do.  It allows \nthem to place a sharper edge on a bladed weapon for a time.\nSharpen requires a special type of stone be used in order to work properly.\n\n                    WARNING WARNING WARNING\n\nThere is a very real chance that attempting to sharpen a weapon will \nDESTROY the weapon.  Dwarves learn with age how to avoid damaging weapons\nand causing anguish. \n~\n\n-1 'NEXUS'~\nSyntax: cast 'nexus' <target>\n\nThis spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the\nonly difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus \nspell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered\nportal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret\nof which has been lost...\n~\n\n-1 'HEAT METAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>\n\nHeat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary \naccording to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment\n(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,\ncausing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the\nprocess (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).\nThis spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY WORD'~\nSyntax: cast 'holy word'\n\nHoly word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with\ndisasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful\nblessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the\nroom are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of\nopposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)\nare struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers\ngreatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and \ndrained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.\n~\n\n-1 FRENZY~\nSyntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>\n\nThe frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing\nhis or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine\nwrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, \nmaking the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm\nspell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's \nalignment.\n~\n\n-1 CALM~\nSyntax: cast 'calm' \n\nOne of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is\nthe calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed\ncreatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage\nin combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence \nactivity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --\neither all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who\nare immune to magic) or none is.\n~\n\n-1 HASTE~\nSyntax: cast 'haste' <target>\n\nThe haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing\nan extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive\nabilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,\nsuch that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating\nthe slow spell. (see 'help slow').\n~\n\n-1 FEAST~\nSyntax: cast 'feast' <target>\n\nThe 'feast' spell is sort of like casting a magic mushroom inside of\nthe belly of your intended target.  Feast will fill up any creature, be\nit living, dead, or undead.  There are times, however, when a given\ncreature doesn't -wish- to be full.  If the victim has 'nocancel' enabled,\nhe or she will receive a saving throw versus the feast spell.\n~\n\n-1 FAMINE~\nSyntax: cast 'famine' <target>\n\nThe 'famine' spell is the antithesis of the 'feast' spell.  It drains\nsustenance from the target, leaving him or her in need of water and \nfood, or whatever else it is the victim thrives off of.  Although the\n'famine' spell is offensive, there are creatures who have a need to be\nhungry.  Hence, if you attempt to cast 'famine' on yourself, you'll always\nsucceed.\n~\n\n-1 SLOW~\nSyntax: cast 'slow' <target>\n\nDespite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell\nwith it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,\nit slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate\nof attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing\nrates, due to reduced metabolism.\n~\n\n-1 PLAGUE~\nSyntax: cast 'plague' <target>\n\nThe plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,\nsapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to\ndeath.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like\nwildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.  Willfully spreading\nplague around and among other players is generally frowned upon, and if you\ndo not take responsibility for your sickness and cure yourself, you may\nfind yourself the subject of the wrath of the immortals.\n~\n\n-1 'CREATE ROSE'~\nSyntax: cast 'create rose'\n\nA romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game\nuse whatsoever.\n~\n\n-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL' 'PROTECTION NEUTRAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>\n        cast 'protection good' <target>\n\tcast 'protection neutral' <target>\n\nThe protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate\nethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not\nbe cast on others, and one person cannot carry more then one defense at \nthe same time.\n~\n\n0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>\n \nThis spell increases the strength of the target character.\n~\n\n-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~\nSyntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>\n\nChain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning\nthat arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully\nexpended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members \nof a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other\nviable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on\ngroups of creatures.\n~\n\n-1 FARSIGHT~\nSyntax: cast 'farsight'\n  cast 'farsight' <direction>\n\nThe farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her\nto see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense\nconcentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.\nThe spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in\nall directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much\nfarther away.\n~\n\n-1 MASS HEALING~\nSyntax: cast 'mass healing' \n\nThe mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell\non all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good\nmeasure.\n~\n\n-1 'FLOATING DISC'~\nSyntax: cast 'floating disc'\n\nThis useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster\naround, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight\npenalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and\nusually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a \nmaximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location\non the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it\nto run out of energy.\n~\n\n-1 FIREPROOF~\nSyntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>\n\nThe fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,\nto protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected\nby this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.\nAlthough inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical\nfor protecting large numbers of objects.\n~\n\n-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~\nSyntax: alias\n  alias <word>\n  alias <word> <substitution>\n  unalias <word>\n\nThe alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,\naliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.\nAlias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with \nthat name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument \nproduces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new\ncommand.  Examples of use:\n\nalias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'\nalias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'\n\nOnly the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.\n~\n\n-1 PSIONICS~\nThe psionic group is a group of mental energy spells.\n\nThe following spells are available in the Psionics group:\n\n'psionic blast'      - does mental damage to the victim and some back to\n                       the spellcaster\n'tower of iron will' - protects the caster from mental attacks\n'body weaponry'      - turns your hands into weapons and your skin to armor\n'lay on hands'       - drains life away from the caster and gives it to\n                       the victim, can kill the caster if the victim needs\n                       more life than the caster has to give\n'mirror image'       - your opponent begins fighting something they think\n                       is you, giving you time to escape\n~\n\n-1 'PSIONIC BLAST' PSIBLAST~\nSyntax: cast 'psionic blast' <victim>\n\nA Psionic Blast will do damage to your victim based on your level,\nintelligence and constitution.  It will also do a fraction of that\ndamage back to you.\n~\n\n-1 'TOWER OF IRON WILL'~\nSyntax: cast 'tower of iron will'\n\nOnce protected by the Tower of Iron Will the caster becomes resistant\nto mental attacks.\n~\n\n-1 'BODY WEAPONRY'~\nSyntax: cast 'body weaponry' <target>\n\nOnce affected by Body Weaponry your hands become magical weapons when \nfighting un-armed and your skin becomes magical armor.\n~\n\n-1 'LAY ON HANDS'~\nSyntax: cast 'lay on hands' <target>\n\nYou lay your hands on another and your life force flows into them.\nIf the one you are giving life to needs more than you have to give\nyou may become mortally wounded.\n~\n\n-1 'MIRROR IMAGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'mirror image'\n\nYour opponent begins fighting something they believe to be you giving\nyou a chance to escape, or...\n~\n\n-1 'BESTOW HOLINESS'~\nSyntax: cast 'bestow holiness' <object>\n\nThis Crusader spell is designed with the favored of the gods in mind.\nThe Crusader can imbue a normal weapon with the holiness of the gods,\nmaking that weapon the perfect selection of any Paladin.\nThere is a chance that a weapon can be given the holy flag permanently.\nHowever, when this happens, there is also a chance that the weapon will\nevaporate.\n\n~\n\n-1 'HOLD PERSON'~\nSyntax: cast 'hold person' <victim>\n\nBringing down the wrath of the gods, the Crusader can stop his\nopponent from moving with this spell.  The victim is prevented from\nwalking anywhere and is unable to use his or her skills,spells or\nabilities. If the held person is attacked, the spell fails.\n~\n\n-1 'ENDURE HEAT' 'ENDURE COLD'~\nSyntax: cast 'endure <heat|cold>' <target>\n\nThis spell, castable only by Crusaders, blesses the target with\nresistance to cold- or heat-based attacks.

Once again, if you wish to join the clan system,\nLONER NOW!\n\nSEE 'clan' 'loner'\n~\n52 VFORGE~\nCreating forge is pretty simple. \nYou need at least 4 different items created before your forge can be coded \nto work. \n* Actual forge\n* At least two item parts that are placed into forge when created \n* And end product of forge. \n\nWhen you have all these items created. Write a note to coders explaining \nyour need, also mention vnums for these itemparts and endproduct so recipe \ncan be coded.  \nAfter you receive the recipe numbers from coders, you can place them into \nvalue0-4 (v0-v4) in forge (so you can have max. 5 different recipes in one \nforge). \n\nFor more complicated forging, You may request skill to be placed into \nrecipe that is taken into account when mortal forges your items. \nFor example: itempart1 and itempart2 is forged into endproduct in \nforge, if mortal has bleed skill he succeeds to create new item. But \nif anyone else but nosferatu tries to forge anything with these items, \nthey just dissolve from the forge leaving nothing behind.\n\nBelow is an example that is to be in the recipes.are file\n#22                      - recipe number\nnoskill 0                - skill and percent needed\n10741                    - vnum of the forge\n10716                    - vnum of the item to be created \n10457 15234 20764 111 0  - vnums of the components (upto five)\n\n\n~\n0 FORGE~\nUsage: forge <forge container>\n\n    Certain items in the game can be placed in a \"forge container\"\nand \"forged\" into a new item.  These items are part of a recipe that\nan Immortal has created, and may include any item(s) in the game.\nThere is a forge currently in the Armor Shop in Midgaard.\n\nThere may or may not be a skill requirement that needs to be met in\norder to forge sucessfully.  There is no way for you to know if this\nis the case.\n\nImmortals:  see the VFORGE helpfile\n~\n\n-1 GRENADE~\nSyntax: grenade <grenade> <target>\n\n   All classees are equally capable of using grenade weapons.  Different \ngrenades may or may not have different affects on their targets.  Only\ngrenade items may be thrown at your targets.  Grenades may not be used \nwhile in combat.\n~\n\n-1 ALCHEMY ALCHEMIST~\n  Alchemy is the art of creating magical potions.  Those with the Alchemist\nkit may create one of the following 6 potions.\n\n   1. Accuracy         - helps you hit things better\n   2. Magic Resistance - makes spells less likely to hurt you\n   3. Vision           - helps you see secret things, and even faded \n\t\t\t nethermancers\n   4. Restoration      - restores a small amount of magical energy\n   5. Speed            - reduces the delay on your actions\n   6. Molotov Cocktail - a weapon with which to smite your foes\n\nYou must be carrying sufficient gold to purchase the ingredients, and be\nin a magelab to make use of the alchemy skill.  The cost of the potion is \nautomatically deducted from your gold when you brew the potion.\n\nMolotov cocktails have a colour associated with them.  Each colour\nis indicative of a specific damage type.  It is up to you to determine\nwhich colours give which type of damage.\n\nSEE ALSO: grenade brew\n~\n\n-1 BREW~\nsyntax: brew <accuracy|resist|vision|mana|speed|molotov>\n\nNote: You must spell out the full name of the potion you wish to brew.\n      I.E. brew molotov NOT brew molo\n~\n\n-1 WYRMSLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-dragon\n\n    Wyrmslayers really don't like dragons.  No, you don't understand.\nThey *REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like dragons, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-lizard sentiment.  The Wyrmslayer spends his or her\nlife dedicated to the destruction of dragons, and so all Wyrmslayers are\ngiven {Cdagger{x and {Cspear{x, just to make sure they've got the tools of\nthe trade.  On top of that, Wyrmslayers are expert at getting their weapons\nthrough those damned dragon scales, and getting their spells past the\ndragon's natural magical resistance.  Due to their extreme hatred of dragons,\nthe Wyrmslayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal damage to the\nlizards.  This is not a special skill, but an inate ability that depends\nsolely on the Wyrmslayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BUFFY SLAYER~\nAvailable to:  Any non-remort\n\n    Slayers really don't like undead.  No, you don't understand. They \n*REALLY* --REALLY-- do _not_ like remorts, and this is more than your\nrun-of-the-mill anti-dead-guy sentiment.  Due to their extreme hatred \nof remorts, the Slayer also has a special enhanced ability to deal \ndamage to the undead.  This is not a special skill, but an inate \nability that depends solely on the Slayer's level.\n~\n\n-1 BISHOP~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Paladin Crusader\n\n    The Bishop is a leader, and supreme spellcaster.  They do not cast\ntheir spells, they access their magic through the use of the {Choly chant{x.\nBishops receive enhanced mana gains, and have the ability to cast all of their\nspells while in combat.  Bishops also receive an extra 100 sac points, and\ncast their spells as a slight reduction in mana cost.\n\nNOTE: All Bishops should save at least two practices for 'holy chant' if \nthey wish to avoid being crippled in the spellcasting arena.\n\nSEE ALSO:  'holy chant'\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY CHANT' CHANT~\nSyntax: chant <spell> <target>\n\n    The chant command is used exactly like the 'cast' command.  The major\ndifference is that the Bishop has a skill percentage with 'chant', and  it\nis checked before he can cast a spell.  This means that Bishops have two skills\nthat must be at an adequate level: 'holy chant', and the spell being chanted.\nIt is advised that all Bishops save at least two practices for 'holy chant'\nbefore they take this kit.\n~\n\n-1 NINJA~\nAvailable to:  Thief Assassin Rogue\n\n    The ninja is the ultimate stealth machine, specializing in two unique\nabilities.  {CNinjitsu{c, and {CKurijitsu{x.  The Ninja also can sneak out \nof combat, and know which way he went.\n\nSEE ALSO: ninjitsu  kurijitsu\n~\n\n-1 NINJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Ninjitsu is the art of concealment, and adept practioners are completely\nimpossible to detect when using ninjitsu incombination with standard stealth-\nrelated skills.\n~\n\n-1 KURIJITSU~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n    Kurijitsu is the art of strategically placing your attacks on an   \nopponent.  Skilled practioners of kurijitsu can do incredible amounts of\ndamage with a single standard attack.  One must be very skilled in kurijitsu\nto fully realize its potential.\n~\n\n-1 PROPHET~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Monk Paladin Crusader\n\n    Of all the religious kits, the Prophet by far is the closest to his\ndeity.  Prophets are the specially chosen ones, who communicate most \nclearly and directly to their gods.  Consequently, they have the ability\nto call upon their faith to {Cimbue{x themselves with enhanced spellcasting\nabilities.  Furthermore, due to their closeness to their deities, Prophets\nreceive an extra practice any time they level.  Finally, Prophets improve\ntheir skills much more quickly than others through manual practice.\n\nSEE ALSO: imbue\n~\n\n-1 IMBUE~\nSyntax: cast 'imbue'\n\n    The 'imbue' spell is a special part of the Prophet kit, and raises the\nProphet's casting level.  The amount of the raise depends on the Prophet's\nclass.\n~\n\n-1 VINDICATOR~\nAvailable to:  Cleric Crusader\n               All races\n\n    The Vindicator is the most militant of religious figures, with a hardy\nframe, and a strong swordarm.  Vindicators are combat-oriented, and tough,\nnot to mention well atuned to the aspets of their gods that provide them  \nwith the most strength: anger.  Vindicators are the only clerics that  \nreceive the {Cthird attack{x skill, and also have the ability to cast a \nunique spell that invokes the {Cwrath{x of their gods.\n\nSEE ALSO: wrath\n~\n\n-1 WRATH~\nSyntax: cast 'wrath' <victim>\n\n\tThe spiritual Wrath of the gods can be invoked and cast upon\nanybody (barring clan/non-clan restrictions) at the will of the \nVindicator.  The spell has the potential to do enormous damage, even more\nso if used succesfully multiple times.  The lingering anger of the gods\nleaves a taint on the victim that can be used to double the damage of this\npowerful spell on the next succesful casting.  The Vindicator must be in\ngood standing with his or her deity for this spell to have its maximum\neffect.\n\n~\n\n-1 BARBARIAN~\nAvailable to:  Warrior Berzerker\n               All races\n\n   The Barbarian is a primal warrior, with brute strength and carnal\nrage as his primary offensive weapons.  Because of this, the Barbarian\nhas two special abilities, {Cendurance{x, and the powerful {Cbarbarian\nrage{x.  Both fit into the Barbarian's style of \"hurt now, ask questions\nlater, if there's anything left to interrogate.\"\n~\n\n-1 ENDURANCE~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The Endurance skill causes the barbarian to take less damage when he is \ninjured.  This includes weapon and magical damage, and it even will reduce\ndamage taken from attacks like backstabs, bites, and damage types that the\nbarbarian is vulnerable too.  The amount of reduction is random, but it can\nbe as high as 30%.\n~\n\n-1 'BARBARIAN RAGE'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\n   The barbarian's rage is a unique type of berserk attack.  It kicks in\nautomatically.  The longer the barbarian has been in combat, the better\nthe chances are of the rage starting up.  Also, the longer the barbarian\nis in combat, the more potent the rage in when it finally does kick in.\nBecause the barbarian is a brute force combatant, he sacrafices some\nregard for personal safety while using the rage, and his AC will suffer.\n~\n\n-1 POQUAH PROWLER~\nPoquah and Prowler... Can't get much smoother than this. Now you know where\nthe 'Roxbury' social comes from.\n~\n\n-1 'KIT'~\n\nQ. What is a 'kit'?\nA. A kit is a special collection of new game mechanics and/or abilities that\nare available to specific classes.\n\nQ. What are the benefits of taking a kit?\nA. You receive special, unique abilities like new skills or spells, and you\nhave a secret card to play in the pkill game, since no one can tell what kit\nyou have.\n\nQ. What is the downside?\nA. You -must- pay practices to take a kit, there is no other way to get one.\n\nQ. Which kits are available for my class?\nA. See 'help kit list'.\n\nQ. Can I take multiple kits?\nA. Sort of.  If you take a kit, you get its skills/spells, but if you change\nkits later, you loose any of that kit's skills and special abilities.  For\nexample, if you take the 'enchanter' kit, and then later switch to another kit\nyou will loose your old enchanting abilities.\n\nQ. Can I trade my kit back in for the practices I spent on it?\nA. No.  Once you take a kit, you are irrevocably stuck with it.\n\nQ. How do I accept a kit?\nA. Type 'kit take <name>'\n\nQ. It says 'huh' when I type 'kit'!\nA. You must be at least level 10 to take a kit.\n\nQ. It says I don't have good enough attributes!\nA. Your -natural- attributes have to meet the minimum required for the kit.\n\nQ. How do I tell what the minimums are?\nA. Type 'kit info <name>'\n\nQ. If I remort, do I loose my kit?\nA. No, unless you were a remort hunter and remort :).  You will be out the\n   100 pracs.  Now, remorts CAN take a remort hunter kit, as long as the \n   kit does not hunt their type of remort.\n\nQ. If I reclass, do I loose my kit?\nA. Yes.\n\n~\n\n0 SHAMAN~\n\n   Shamans are tribal witch doctors, primitive practicioners of arcane magicks.\nTheir speciality is the practice of gradually and painfully killing their enemies.\nShamans are experts as inflicting disease upon people, and as such, are the primary\nusers of 'damage over time' spells.  Shaman DOT spells are the most powerful DOTs\nin the game, and can inflict hundreds of points of damage to a target.\n\n   Shamans have access to the 'disease' spell group, which contains four disease-\nbased DOT spells.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'damage over time' 'disease'\n~\n\n0 DISEASE~\nDisease Spell Group - Shaman Kit Only\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDamage Cap Level\n    \tLevel 18\tContagion\t\t35\n\tLevel 28\tBlight\t\t\t40\n\tLevel 38\tBoiling Blood\t\t45\n\tLevel 48\tScourge\t\t\t50\n\n\tThe four weapons of the Disease spell group.  Each does some damage when\ncast, and some recurring damage over the next few minutes.  Scourge lasts the\nlongest of these.  All of these spells have an effective level cap at which the\namount of damage they do ceases to increase with level.  Note that saving throws\nversus these spells are still done against the ACTUAL casting level of the caster.\nBut the affect caps at the above levels.  The spells cannot be cancelled.  The\nmedics of Midgaard have yet to devise a way to cure these diseases.\n\n\tAll cost 75 mana and have a 2-round delay.  Experienced victims of these\nspells have indicated that the further they get from the caster, the less damage\nthe spells do.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'shaman' 'damage over time'\n~\n\n-1 'KIT LIST'~\n\n KIT             AVAILABILTY\nAcrobat\t\tThief Rogue Assassin Monk\nAlchemist\tMage Wizard\nArcheologist    Any (except Remorts)\nBarbarian\tWarrior Berzerker\nBattlerager\tWarrior Cleric Crusader (Dwarf Only)\nBishop\t\tCleric Crusader Paladin\nBladesinger\tWarrior Blademaster Mage Wizard (Elf Only) \nBrawler  \tWarrior Thief Berzerker Samurai Rogue Blademaster\nBuffy\t\tAny (except Remorts)\nCavalier        Warrior Paladin Samurai\nEnchanter\tMage Wizard\nFence           Rogue Thief Assassin\nKnight\t\tWarrior Blademaster Cleric Paladin\nLycanthrope \n  Hunter        Any (except Remorts)\nMedium          Mage Cleric Monk Druid Elementalist Wizard Crusader\nMyrmidon\tWarrior Blademaster (except yinns)\nNature Friend\tDruid\nNecromancer     Mage Wizard\nNethermancer\tMage Wizard\nNinja\t\tThief Rogue Assassin\nProphet \tCleric Crusader Paladin Monk\nRanger\t\tWarrior Thief Rogue Blademaster\nScribe          Mage Wizard Cleric\nShaman\t\tMage Wizard Cleric Crusader\nShapeshifter\tDruid Elementalist\nSpirit Caller   Druid\nShadow Stalker  Thief Rogue\nStaff Crafter   {YDRUID{x Cleric Crusader\nSummoner\tElementalist\nVampyre Hunter  Any (Except Remorts)\nVindicator\tCleric Crusader\nWand Maker      Mage Wizard\nWarlock\t\tMage Wizard (Male Only)\nWitch\t\tMage Wizard (Female Only)\nWu Jen\t\tMage Monk Samurai\nWyrmslayer\tAny (except dragons)\n\n\nSome suggestions that you needn't bother with:\n    Do not suggest 'balance' things (\"If class X has 6 options, so should\n    class Y!\"  \"If there is a dwarf-only kit there should be a faerie-only\n    kit too!\").  Do not suggest overly specific things.  A 'knight' kit\n    would be ok.  A 'yinnish knight' or 'elven archer' or 'elf scribe' is\n    too specific.

They are born of the\nnight, and as such, they suffer damage during the sunlight as remorts\ndo.  Gargoyles cannot escape this torment, even when indoors.  During\nthe night, Gargoyles gain resistance to some types of damage.  But\nduring the day, that resistance becomes a vulnerability.  They are\nmedium sized and can excel at any class.  They can fly, see in the\ninfrared spectrum, and have an inate ability to see invisible.\n~\n\n-1 ROCKBITER~\nRockbiters are gigantic creatures who are made of and thrive off of \nrocks and minerals.  They are the largest of all the races, and are \nthick and resiliant.  Their major weakness is that they are slow\nof movement.

They also receive the dodge skill for free.\n~\n\n-1 MUTANTS~\nMutants are a unique race of unstable beings.  They have a natural form that\nvaguely resembles humans, but they will, at random times, mutate into other\nraces.  When they mutate, they take on the resistances, vulnerabilities,\nsize, and special characteristics of that race.  Their maximum attributes\nchange as well.  Mutants may learn skills unique to a given race, and retain\nthat knowledge long after they've changed to something else.  They have no \ncontrol over what they become.  Note that mutants will also change their CP\ndepending on what race they turn into, and will spend the overwhelming majority\nof their time with smaller CP than the mutant race naturally has.  This is not\na race for the impatient or inexperienced.  Your results will vary wildly from\nthose of other mutants.\n~\n\n-1 ELF ELVES~\nElves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.  They\nlack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are for more agile,\nboth in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but have at\nbest fair talent as warriors or priests.\n\nElves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.\nBecause they are notoriously hard to spot, and so all elves, regardless of \nclass, may use sneak and hide.\n~\n\n-1 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALF~\nHalf-elves are decendents of the Elven race, yet along the way, they\nstrayed from the pure path of Elven lineage to persue true happiness\noutside their blood.  Half-elves are decendent, in majority, from\nhumans and elves.  Due to this, they are quite balanced, nearly\nexact, between the human, and that of the elf.  They have the ability\nto sneak like an elf, with their lithe bodies (if capable to do so),\nbut they have also learned to strengthen themselves, healing quickly\nas a natural ability.  They also have the ability to see in the dark\nlike their forefather elves.\n~\n\n-1 VOLARE~\nVolare are a race of angelic creatures, decended from the heavens from\nthe eyes of Mojo.

They are a fairly intellegent\nrace, with an internal code of discipline and honor.  Even still, they have\nshort tempers, and quick swords, and do not hesitate to solve a problem\nthrough combat.  Yinn excel at most anything they do.  They are quite\nvicious.\n~\n\n-1 KENDER~\nKender are related to elves but with slightly higher strength, dexterity\nand constitution.  They lack a bit in wisdom and significantly in\nintelligence.  They are born thieves, too fidgety for other professions.\nBeing so so nimble they get the dodge skill for free and are resistant\nto being bashed.  Being so tiny they are more vulnerable to cold and\npoison.\n~\n\n-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~\nHumans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of\nadventurers. Although they have no special talents like the other races,\nthey are more versitile, being skilled in all four classes. Humans may\nalso train their primary stat higher than any other race, and are able to\ngain more benefit from magical devices.\n~\n\n-1 OGRE OGRES~\nOgres are one of the biggest races, ranging from 9-12 feet in height.  They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Ogres make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nOgres resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Ogres,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree.

They\nare stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as the dwarves.  \nThey aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes them more clumsy\nthan the other races.  Giants make the best warriors of any race, but are\nill-suited for any other profession.\n\nGiants resist heat and cold with nary a mark, due to their huge mass.  However,\ntheir slow minds make them extremely vulnerable to mental attacks.  Giants,\ndue to their size and stamina, receive the fast healing and bash skills for\nfree. (Only giant warriors recive bash).\n~\n\n-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~\nMagical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the\nnecessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The\nitem skills are as follows:\n\nscrolls   The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')\nstaves    The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')\nwands   The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') \n~\n \n-1 'GROUP HEADER'~\nThe following skills and groups are available to your chacter:\n(this list may be seen again by typing list)\n{YNOTE:{x  The more skills you add, the higher your creation points will \n           be.  The higher your CP the more experience you will need to\n           level.  \n~\n\n-1 'GROUP HELP'~\nThe following commands are available:\nlist         display all groups and skills not yet bought\nlearned      show all groups and skills bought \npremise      brief explanation of creation points and skill groups\nadd <name>   buy a skill or group\ndrop <name>  discard a skill or group\ninfo <name>  list the skills or spells contained within a group\nhelp <name>  help on skills and groups, or other help topics\ndone       exit the character generation process\n~\n\n-1 'MENU CHOICE'~\nChoice (add,drop,list,help)?~\n\n-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~\nThe MHM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making\nhim or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick\nat character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are \npaid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the\nharder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to\npractice.\n\nSkill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells\nthat are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a \ndefault skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced \nselection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.\n\nThe experience breakdown is as follows: \npoints   exp/level     points   exp/level\n40        1000         90        6000\n50        1500         100       8000\n60    2000         110      12000\n70        3000         120      16000 \n80        4000         130      24000\nThe table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.\n~\n\n-1 BASICS 'MHS BASICS'~\nThe basic skills:\n\nEvery character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default\nset that all characters receive.  The default skills are:\n\nrecall    essential escape skill (see help recall)\nscrolls   reading of scrolls and other magical volumes\nstaves    use of magical staves\nwands   use of magical wands\nscan      checking who is in the area\nswimming  swimming through traverable water\n\nfor class defaults, check the classes themselves.\n~\n\n-1 DRUID DRUIDS~\nDruids specialize in the control of magic in all it's forms.  They\nbecome more powerful with age.  They may gain all the spell groups\nclerics or mages may gain as well as the special ability to control\ndefensive orbs.\n~\n\n-1 ROGUES~\nRogues are the consummate theives of Boinga.  They have access to all the same\nskills as a thief, including steal and slice, and perform these skills with\ngreater ease than does a thief.  Rogues are also extremely difficult to detect\nand are very good at sneaking and hiding.  Rogues gain hp and mana the same as\na standard thief.\n~\n\n-1 ENCHANTER~\nThe Enchanter receives no new spells or skills, but (s)he is the absolute\nfinest enchanting mage in the realm.  The enchanter not only succeeds more\noften, but has the ability to do super-enchants, that are twice as good\nas even the impression 'brilliant' enchantments.\n~\n\n-1 BRAWLER~\n\n Brawlers are practiced at fighting multiple opponents.  Even while engaged\n in combat, they can switch the focus of their attacks to somebody else.  The\n do this through use of the \"attack\" command.  They can switch to either \n another person who is fighting them, or try to draw an idle third party into\n the fight.  This ability does not override pkill ranges, clan/non-clan status,\n or kill stealing code.\n\n~\n\n-1 WU JEN 'WU JEN'~\nPractitioners of the oriental magical arts, the Wu Jen specializes in\nself enhancement.  By {Wfocus{xing their mana to cast a spell they literally\ndamage themselves to increase the strength of the spell.

Sometimes a failure in the sight will inform the victim\nthat someone is searching for them.  Anyone may succeed on an NPC, but\nnon-clanners will not be able to use this spell on clanners. This is a\nmental attack type.\n~\n\n-1 ACROBAT~\nThe Acrobat kit combines quick reflexes with dexterity to create an agile\nand dangerous thief.  The acrobat is difficult to hit, and difficult to \nkeep in one place for very long.  Their ability to use the {Ctumbling{x\nskill provides them with a unique ability to avoid getting hit.\n\nSEE ALSO: {Ctumbling{x\n~\n\n-1 TUMBLING~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nTumbling is a special acrobat ability.  Tumbling increases the user's\ndodging ability, as well as permits him/her to roll out of the way of \nbashes, and even roll from a bash into a standing position.\n~\n\n-1 BLADEMASTERS~\nThe Blademaster is a double-warrior reclass.  They have the same hit points and\nmana as a normal warrior, and can specialize in any weapon group.  The\nBlademaster is ultra-accurate with his/her weapons, and is very difficult to\ndodge, parry, or block, and almost impossible to disarm.  However, the \nBlademasters has the unique ability to disarm a weapon and catch it.  They\nalso have access to the 'dual wield' skill.\n~\n\n-1 'DUAL WIELD'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nDual wield permits a Blademaster to use two different weapons at once, \nallowing for a strategic combinatino of special flags and damage types.\nTo use dual wield, the Blademaster simply wears two seperate weapons. \nThis skill -only- works while the Blademaster has two weapons.  If his or\nher primary weapon is somehow disarmed, he/she must wear another.  The\nsecondary weapon must be either exotic, or of the same weapon group as the\noriginal.  This combined with specialization makes for a powrful fighting\ncharacter in the Blademaster.  The secondary weapon must also be lighter\nthan the primary.  Finally, it is possible to use a sword-dagger combination.\n~\n-1 CRUSADE~\nThis spell is available only to those who know the piety spell group.  It\nallows you to call upon the power of your diety to drain a targets sacrifice\npoints.

They specialize in control of their body\nand using it to it's full potential.  As such they get and AC bonus on\narmor worn on body locations that normally do not receive bonuses.  They\ncan control their life energy, or 'chi', lowering their movement costs\nand they can master the art of throwing their opponent to the ground.\n~\n\n-1 MONK MONKS~\nMonks are thief clerics.  They specialize in special combat arts as well\nas issues of spirit and religion.  They are better able to defend\nthemselves and their AC is based on the weight of their armor, not it's\nstrength.

Sacraficing the traditional\ntools of the trade, the elementalist has access to a handful of clerical\nspells, and an entire arsenal of new spells.

Their combat skills are marginal, but it is more\nthan made up for by a an impressive command of the world's natural forces.\n\nA default elementalist begins with the dagger and mace as his/her only\nweapons, and access to the four basic elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water.\nThe elements of Energy and Spirit are also available for a cost.\n\nSee also: 'element earth' 'element air' 'element fire'\n          'element water' 'element spirit' 'element energy'\n\n~\n\n-1 MAGE 'MAGIC-USER' 'MAGE BASICS' ~\nMages specialize in the casting of spells, offensive ones in particular.\nMages have the highest-powered magic of any class.

Any other weapon skills must be\npurchased, at a very high rate.\n\nSee 'help mage default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 CLERIC 'CLERIC BASICS' ~\nClerics are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their\nspells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells\nbeing far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best \nclass by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of\nprotective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.\n\nAll clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must\nbe purchased, many at a very dear cost.\n\nSee 'help cleric default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' ~\nThieves are a marginal class.

They are better fighters than\nclerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.\n\nAll thieves begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as \nwell.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection\nis chosen.  \n\nSee 'help thief default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' ~\nWarriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters\nof all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical\ntalents of mages and priests.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind\ntaking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.\n\nWarriors begin with skill in the sword, and gain a second attack in combat.\nOther weapon skills may be purchased cheaply, or gained in the default skill\npackage.\n\nSee 'help warrior default' for information on the default package.\n~\n\n-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~\nEach weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how\nwell a character fights with a particular weapon.

Only mages may enchant.\n\nenchant weapon  increases the hit and damage bonuses of a weapon\nenchant armor increases the protective value of armor\nfireproof       shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nrecharge  restores power to a depleted wand or staff\n~\n\n-1 ENHANCEMENT~\nThe enhancement spells improve upon the body's pontential, allowing feats of\nsuperhuman strength and speed.  However, these spells may often have harmful\neffects upon the recipient.\n\ngiant strength  grants increased strength\nhaste   doubles the speed of the target, but slows down healing\ninfravision allows monsters to be seen in the dark\nwarp        changes the size of armor\nrefresh   restores energy to tired adventurers\n~\n\n\n-1 HARMFUL~\nThis spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed\nto tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against\nitself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.\nIn order of power, the harmful spells are:\n\ncause light inflicts minor wounds on an enemy\ncause serious inflicts wounds on a foe\ncause critical  causes major damage to the target\nharm    the most deadly harmful spell\n~\n\n-1 HEALING~\nThe healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably\nsuffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the\ncurative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.\nIn order of power, the healing spells are:\n\ncure light  heals minor wounds\nrefresh   restores vigor to a tired adventurer\ncure serious  heals wounds\ncure critical closes all but the worst wounds\nheal    the most powerful healing spell\nmass healing  casts a heal spell on each player in the room\n~\n\n-1 ILLUSION~\nThe illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be\nused to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,\nthe illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.\nOnly thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the \nfollowing:\n\ninvis   turns the target invisible\nmass invis  turns the caster's group invisible\nventriloquate allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth\n\n~\n\n-1 MALADICTIONS~\nMaladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to\ncripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells\nmay be cast by any class.\n\nfamine   causes the victim to become ravenously hungry\nblindess  strikes the target blind\ncurse   prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat\nenergy drain  drains experience and mana, while strengthening the caster\nplague    causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death from plague\npoison    weaker than plague, but often fatal\nslow    slows your enemies down, reducing their rate of attack  \nweaken    drains the strength of the target\n~\n\n-1 PROTECTIVE~\nThe protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or\nphysical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after\nsanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling\nhostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following \nspells:\n\narmor   provides the target with an extra layer of defense\ncancellation  a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends\ndispel magic  removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel\nfireproof shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid\nprotection evil provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures\nprotection good protects from the attacks of good beings\nsanctuary reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half\nshield    puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies\nstoneskin turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost\n~\n\n-1 TRANSPORTATION~\nThe transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical\nteleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,\nwhich are among the most useful in the game.\n\nfly   allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles\ngate    transports the caster to the target\nnexus   forms a two-way portal to a far off destination\npass door allows the caster to walk through walls\nportal    creates a one-way portal to a destination\nsummon    transports the target to the caster\nteleport  sends the target to a random location\nword of recall  transports the caster to safety in Midgaard\n~\n\n-1 WEATHER~\nThese spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well\nas summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is\nusable by all classes.\n\ncall lightning  summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right\ncontrol weather changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster\nfaerie fire surrounds the target in a glowing aura\nfaerie fog  reveals all hidden creatures in the room\nlightning bolt  sends a bolt of electricity into the target\n\n(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)\n~\n\n-1 BACKSTAB~\nBackstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It \ncan be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.\nThe damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his\nweapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.\n~\n\n-1 BASH~\nThe bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock\nyour foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the\nbash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon\nis not generally a wise idea.\n~\n\n-1 THROW THROWS~\nThe throw skill is a samurai talent.  In a single deft movement the samurai's\nvictim is flipped and thrown to the ground putting them into a daze.\n~\n\n-1 KAILINDO~\nAn anceint martial arts skill, kailindo is the art of blocking and striking.\n~\n\n-1 BERSERK~\nOnly powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage\nin combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge\nsurge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  \nBerserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.\n~\n\n-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~\nConsider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever \ncombatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The\nblindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity\nhelps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may\nlearn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 GAROTTE~\nThis skill is the art of choking your opponent into unconsciousness using\na wire or rope with handles on the ends as a weapon.  These weapons are\ngenerally useless for any other purpose.  Success depends on suprising the\nvictim.  This skill is available only to assassins.\n~\n\n-1 DISARM~\nDisarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your\nopponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you\nare skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented thieves\nand warriors may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 DODGE~\nIn the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not\nbe where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the\ncharacter's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the \ntarget. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the\nattacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.\n~\n\n-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~\nWarriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are\nable to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked\nfor with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus\nis very low indeed.\n~\n\n-1 ENVENOM~\nThe envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to\nwin a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.\nOr, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.\nFood, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned\nfood or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to\nbe more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could\ndrink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on\nthe other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison \nburns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates \nquickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.\n~\n\n-1 'HAND TO HAND'~\nHand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this\nstyle of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.\nTrained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.\nClerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages\nmay also learn it.\n~\n\n-1 KICK~\nKicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful\nkick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters\nand clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn\nit.\n~\n\n-1 PARRY~\nIf at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting \nattacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for\nfull success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced\ndamage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the\ndefender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.\n~\n\n-1 RESCUE~\nA friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with\nthe rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede\nin combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the\nfavor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as\nwell as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and\nthe target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)\n~\n\n-1 TRIP~\nBack by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves\nusing any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.\nTripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will\nfind the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.\n~\n\n-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~\nTraining in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes\nin combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every\nround.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a \nvery hard time with it.\n~\n\n-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~\nTraining in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike\nin a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect\nthird attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly\nskilled thieves may learn this skill.\n~\n\n-1 HIDE SNEAK~\nHide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.\nHide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the\ncharacter remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to\nsneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and\nthieves may learn these skills.\n~\n\n-1 'FAST HEALING'~\nThe fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,\nor sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general \ntoughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is \npossible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it\nvery difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.\n~\n\n-1 LORE~\nLore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use\nof the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,\nconcerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value\nof an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may\nlearn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard\nto use.\n~\n\n-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~\nHaggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to\nmatch wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,\nor to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are \nalready very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best \nguard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, \nalthough other classes may learn it as well.\n~\n\n-1 PEEK~\nThe peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,\nthe better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are\nharder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most\ncommon practicioners.\n~\n\n-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~\nLock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain\naccess to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  \nintelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may\nlearn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.\n~\n\n-1 COMMUNION~\nA skill unique to clerics, the communion skill allows the cleric to convert\nhis or her past offerings to his/her deity into hit points or mana.  The\nuse of communion is automatic, and is done when the cleric attempts to\ncast a spell without having enough mana, or is attacked and does not have\nenough hit points to survive the hit.\n~\n\n-1 MEDITATION~\nThis skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and\nmantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.\nThieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have\nmuch trouble learning to meditate.\n~\n\n-1 CHI~\nThis skill is the art of controling your life force.  When control total\ncontrol of your chi is acheived movement costs can be cut in half.\n~\n-1 'DETECT GOOD' 'DETECT EVIL'~\nSyntax: cast 'detect good'\n        cast 'detect evil' \n\t\nThese spells enable the caster to detect good and evil characters. Good \nreveals a golden aura and Evil reveals a red aura. Casting of either of\nthese spell will reveal both good and evil, it is not necessary to cast\nboth upon yourself.\n~\n\n-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~\nSyntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>\n \nDispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on \nthe pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their\nperil.\n~\n\n\n-1 'RECHARGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'recharge' <item>\n\nThe recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.\nFully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell\nis proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be\nrecharged one time successfully.\n~\n\n-1 'DEMONFIRE'~\nSyntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>\n\nDemonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those\nwho follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to \ninflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.\n~\n\n-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>\n\nRay of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth\na beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants\nof evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike \ncasters who are tainted by evil.\n~\n\n-1 'PORTAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'portal' <target>\n\nThe portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal\nto the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are\nentered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot\nbe made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.\nPortal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the\nsecret of this material component has been lost...\n~\n-1 'SHARPEN'~\nSyntax: sharpen 'weapon'\n\nSharpen is an inate ability that all dwarves know how to do.  It allows \nthem to place a sharper edge on a bladed weapon for a time.\nSharpen requires a special type of stone be used in order to work properly.\n\n                    WARNING WARNING WARNING\n\nThere is a very real chance that attempting to sharpen a weapon will \nDESTROY the weapon.  Dwarves learn with age how to avoid damaging weapons\nand causing anguish. \n~\n\n-1 'NEXUS'~\nSyntax: cast 'nexus' <target>\n\nThis spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the\nonly difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus \nspell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered\nportal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret\nof which has been lost...\n~\n\n-1 'HEAT METAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>\n\nHeat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary \naccording to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment\n(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,\ncausing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the\nprocess (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).\nThis spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.\n~\n\n-1 'HOLY WORD'~\nSyntax: cast 'holy word'\n\nHoly word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with\ndisasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful\nblessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the\nroom are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of\nopposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)\nare struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers\ngreatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and \ndrained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.\n~\n\n-1 FRENZY~\nSyntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>\n\nThe frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing\nhis or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine\nwrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, \nmaking the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm\nspell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's \nalignment.\n~\n\n-1 CALM~\nSyntax: cast 'calm' \n\nOne of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is\nthe calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed\ncreatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage\nin combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence \nactivity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --\neither all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who\nare immune to magic) or none is.\n~\n\n-1 HASTE~\nSyntax: cast 'haste' <target>\n\nThe haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing\nan extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive\nabilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,\nsuch that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating\nthe slow spell. (see 'help slow').\n~\n\n-1 FEAST~\nSyntax: cast 'feast' <target>\n\nThe 'feast' spell is sort of like casting a magic mushroom inside of\nthe belly of your intended target.  Feast will fill up any creature, be\nit living, dead, or undead.  There are times, however, when a given\ncreature doesn't -wish- to be full.  If the victim has 'nocancel' enabled,\nhe or she will receive a saving throw versus the feast spell.\n~\n\n-1 FAMINE~\nSyntax: cast 'famine' <target>\n\nThe 'famine' spell is the antithesis of the 'feast' spell.  It drains\nsustenance from the target, leaving him or her in need of water and \nfood, or whatever else it is the victim thrives off of.  Although the\n'famine' spell is offensive, there are creatures who have a need to be\nhungry.  Hence, if you attempt to cast 'famine' on yourself, you'll always\nsucceed.\n~\n\n-1 SLOW~\nSyntax: cast 'slow' <target>\n\nDespite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell\nwith it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,\nit slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate\nof attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing\nrates, due to reduced metabolism.\n~\n\n-1 PLAGUE~\nSyntax: cast 'plague' <target>\n\nThe plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,\nsapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to\ndeath.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like\nwildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.  Willfully spreading\nplague around and among other players is generally frowned upon, and if you\ndo not take responsibility for your sickness and cure yourself, you may\nfind yourself the subject of the wrath of the immortals.\n~\n\n-1 'CREATE ROSE'~\nSyntax: cast 'create rose'\n\nA romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game\nuse whatsoever.\n~\n\n-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL' 'PROTECTION NEUTRAL'~\nSyntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>\n        cast 'protection good' <target>\n\tcast 'protection neutral' <target>\n\nThe protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate\nethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not\nbe cast on others, and one person cannot carry more then one defense at \nthe same time.\n~\n\n0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~\nSyntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>\n \nThis spell increases the strength of the target character.\n~\n\n-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~\nSyntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>\n\nChain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning\nthat arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully\nexpended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members \nof a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other\nviable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on\ngroups of creatures.\n~\n\n-1 FARSIGHT~\nSyntax: cast 'farsight'\n  cast 'farsight' <direction>\n\nThe farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her\nto see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense\nconcentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.\nThe spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in\nall directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much\nfarther away.\n~\n\n-1 MASS HEALING~\nSyntax: cast 'mass healing' \n\nThe mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell\non all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good\nmeasure.\n~\n\n-1 'FLOATING DISC'~\nSyntax: cast 'floating disc'\n\nThis useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster\naround, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight\npenalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and\nusually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a \nmaximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location\non the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it\nto run out of energy.\n~\n\n-1 FIREPROOF~\nSyntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>\n\nThe fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,\nto protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected\nby this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.\nAlthough inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical\nfor protecting large numbers of objects.\n~\n\n-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~\nSyntax: alias\n  alias <word>\n  alias <word> <substitution>\n  unalias <word>\n\nThe alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,\naliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.\nAlias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with \nthat name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument \nproduces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new\ncommand.  Examples of use:\n\nalias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'\nalias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'\n\nOnly the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.\n~\n\n-1 PSIONICS~\nThe psionic group is a group of mental energy spells.\n\nThe following spells are available in the Psionics group:\n\n'psionic blast'      - does mental damage to the victim and some back to\n                       the spellcaster\n'tower of iron will' - protects the caster from mental attacks\n'body weaponry'      - turns your hands into weapons and your skin to armor\n'lay on hands'       - drains life away from the caster and gives it to\n                       the victim, can kill the caster if the victim needs\n                       more life than the caster has to give\n'mirror image'       - your opponent begins fighting something they think\n                       is you, giving you time to escape\n~\n\n-1 'PSIONIC BLAST' PSIBLAST~\nSyntax: cast 'psionic blast' <victim>\n\nA Psionic Blast will do damage to your victim based on your level,\nintelligence and constitution.  It will also do a fraction of that\ndamage back to you.\n~\n\n-1 'TOWER OF IRON WILL'~\nSyntax: cast 'tower of iron will'\n\nOnce protected by the Tower of Iron Will the caster becomes resistant\nto mental attacks.\n~\n\n-1 'BODY WEAPONRY'~\nSyntax: cast 'body weaponry' <target>\n\nOnce affected by Body Weaponry your hands become magical weapons when \nfighting un-armed and your skin becomes magical armor.\n~\n\n-1 'LAY ON HANDS'~\nSyntax: cast 'lay on hands' <target>\n\nYou lay your hands on another and your life force flows into them.\nIf the one you are giving life to needs more than you have to give\nyou may become mortally wounded.\n~\n\n-1 'MIRROR IMAGE'~\nSyntax: cast 'mirror image'\n\nYour opponent begins fighting something they believe to be you giving\nyou a chance to escape, or...\n~\n\n-1 'BESTOW HOLINESS'~\nSyntax: cast 'bestow holiness' <object>\n\nThis Crusader spell is designed with the favored of the gods in mind.\nThe Crusader can imbue a normal weapon with the holiness of the gods,\nmaking that weapon the perfect selection of any Paladin.\nThere is a chance that a weapon can be given the holy flag permanently.\nHowever, when this happens, there is also a chance that the weapon will\nevaporate.\n\n~\n\n-1 'HOLD PERSON'~\nSyntax: cast 'hold person' <victim>\n\nBringing down the wrath of the gods, the Crusader can stop his\nopponent from moving with this spell.  The victim is prevented from\nwalking anywhere and is unable to use his or her skills,spells or\nabilities. If the held person is attacked, the spell fails.\n~\n\n-1 'ENDURE HEAT' 'ENDURE COLD'~\nSyntax: cast 'endure <heat|cold>' <target>\n\nThis spell, castable only by Crusaders, blesses the target with\nresistance to cold- or heat-based attacks.  It only works on creatures\nthat do not already have sort of innate resistance or vulnerability to\nthese attacks.  It won't, for exmaple, work on a dragon to counter their\nvulnerability to cold.\n~\n\n-1 'AID'~\nSyntax: cast 'aid' <target>\n\nThe Crusader can temporarily increase his or her maximum hit points, or\nthose of a companion through the use of the aid spell.  The increase is\na fraction of the target's maximum hit points.\n~\n\n-1 'INFILTRATE'~\nSyntax: automatic\n\nThe infiltrate ability allows rogues to enter private or solitary rooms\neven while they are occupied.  Additionally, infiltrate can also be used\nto enter guilds to which the rogue does not belong.  Lastly, infitrate\ncan allow the rogue to pick up objects without being seen by others in\nthe room.\n\n~\n\n-1 WIZARD~\nThe Wizard is the mage double-reclass.  They receive hit points and mana \nas mages do.  The Wizard is the best enchantor in the land, as well has\nhaving access to a handful of choice spells.  In the illusion group, the\nWizard receives blur.  In the maladictions group he finds 'feeblemind' 'forget'\nand 'fumble'.  In transportation, 'knock', and in Necromancy, 'enervation'.\nSee the individual helpfiles on these spells for more information.\n~\n\n-1 BLUR~\nSyntax: cast 'blur' <target>\n\nThe blur spell is part of the illusion group, but is accessible only to\nWizards.  It improves the wizards armor class, while also making it easier\nfor him or her to dodge incoming attacks.

They are completely\nincharge of the necromantic spells.  Players who take this kit gain one\nnew spell (wraithform) and an innate ability (vampiric touch).\nNecromancers gain bonuses for being evil when they cast necromantic \nspells. If a necromancer is not living up to their alignment expectations,\nthey suffer a penality when casting necromantic spells.\nBecause they live an evil life, their alignment will not drop\nwhen these spells are cast.\nNecromancers are also very creepy, so they do not cast beguiling spells\nvery well.  \n\nsee also:  vampiric touch\nsee also:  wraithform\n\n~\n0 WRAITHFORM~\n\nsyntax:  c 'wraithform'\n\nBy casting this spell, the necromancer is turned into a wraith like mist.\nBecause they are made of mist, they are limited in thier actions.  \nLikewise, there is very little on this world that can affect someone in\nwraithform.\nThe necromancer *MUST* leave wraithform before the duration of the spell\nhas worn out, or they will die.  All of thier material possessions will\ncross into the Netherworld.\nEntering into and leaving wraithform does require quite some time to \naccomplish.\n\nsee also: UNWRAITH or unwraith, I would really really suggest you read\n          the unwraith helpfile. -Boogums\n\n\n~\n0 UNWRAITH~\n\nsyntax:  unwraith\n\nThis is an automatic command, there is no percent or chance of failure.\nThis command takes the necromancer out of wraithform.

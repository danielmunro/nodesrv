No dust has settled over the furniture or\nthe floor, as though it is scared to do so.  A small bed with beautiful\nblack silk sheets is in the corner.  Opposite the bed is a fireplace, its\nhearth carved of pure obsidian and its ever=present warmth takes a bit of\nthe unnatural chill from the room.  A dining table and two chairs sit off\nto one side, already set for the next meal.\n~\n0 PT 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16184\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16182\nS\n#16184\nGwenhwyvar's Laboratory~\nA chill comes over you as you walk into the circular room and the cold\nfrom the bare stone floor seems to seep through your boots into your body.\nAlthough there are no windows, it seems as though there is a cold draft.  A\nmixture of sweet, sour and bitter smells from the herbs kept for use as\nspell components occupies the room.  Bookshelves cover the walls of the\nroom from midway up the wall to the ceiling.  The bookshelves are filled\nwith large, leatherbound tomes covered with mystical runes of silver and\ngold scribed into them.  Again, no dust defaces the room.  There is very \nlittle furniture, save a wooden table, obviously used for preparing spell\ncomponents and studying, and chair beside it in the middle of the room.\n~\n0 DPT 0\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384

The tower is filled with a sense of\nforeboding evil and you are unable to control a shiver as you survey the\nroom.  Two windows allow splinters of light into the otherwise dark room.\nThrough one window you can make out the ivory-white marble walls of\nBlackstaff's Tower.  The other gives you a view of a vast plain of clouds,\ncompletely devoid of anything but a thick, white mist.  Directly before\nyou, ebony stairs lead up to the higher levels of the tower.\n~\n0 PT 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16183\nS\n#16183\nGwenhwyvar's Living Quarters~\nThe room is sparcely furnished, with only the bare necessities gracing\nthe view of the room before you.  No dust has settled over the furniture or\nthe floor, as though it is scared to do so.  A small bed with beautiful\nblack silk sheets is in the corner.  Opposite the bed is a fireplace, its\nhearth carved of pure obsidian and its ever=present warmth takes a bit of\nthe unnatural chill from the room.  A dining table and two chairs sit off\nto one side, already set for the next meal.\n~\n0 PT 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16184\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16182\nS\n#16184\nGwenhwyvar's Laboratory~\nA chill comes over you as you walk into the circular room and the cold\nfrom the bare stone floor seems to seep through your boots into your body.\nAlthough there are no windows, it seems as though there is a cold draft.  A\nmixture of sweet, sour and bitter smells from the herbs kept for use as\nspell components occupies the room.  Bookshelves cover the walls of the\nroom from midway up the wall to the ceiling.  The bookshelves are filled\nwith large, leatherbound tomes covered with mystical runes of silver and\ngold scribed into them.  Again, no dust defaces the room.  There is very \nlittle furniture, save a wooden table, obviously used for preparing spell\ncomponents and studying, and chair beside it in the middle of the room.\n~\n0 DPT 0\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384

Dried blood and other unrecognizable\ninnards are plastered on the floor and walls from previous glorious\nbattles fought in this age-old room.\n~\n0 CDNTU 0\nS\n#16176\nFields for the Dead~\nYou are surrounded by fields of scorched grass.

The tower is filled with a sense of\nforeboding evil and you are unable to control a shiver as you survey the\nroom.  Two windows allow splinters of light into the otherwise dark room.\nThrough one window you can make out the ivory-white marble walls of\nBlackstaff's Tower.  The other gives you a view of a vast plain of clouds,\ncompletely devoid of anything but a thick, white mist.  Directly before\nyou, ebony stairs lead up to the higher levels of the tower.\n~\n0 PT 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16183\nS\n#16183\nGwenhwyvar's Living Quarters~\nThe room is sparcely furnished, with only the bare necessities gracing\nthe view of the room before you.  No dust has settled over the furniture or\nthe floor, as though it is scared to do so.  A small bed with beautiful\nblack silk sheets is in the corner.  Opposite the bed is a fireplace, its\nhearth carved of pure obsidian and its ever=present warmth takes a bit of\nthe unnatural chill from the room.  A dining table and two chairs sit off\nto one side, already set for the next meal.\n~\n0 PT 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16184\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16182\nS\n#16184\nGwenhwyvar's Laboratory~\nA chill comes over you as you walk into the circular room and the cold\nfrom the bare stone floor seems to seep through your boots into your body.\nAlthough there are no windows, it seems as though there is a cold draft.  A\nmixture of sweet, sour and bitter smells from the herbs kept for use as\nspell components occupies the room.  Bookshelves cover the walls of the\nroom from midway up the wall to the ceiling.  The bookshelves are filled\nwith large, leatherbound tomes covered with mystical runes of silver and\ngold scribed into them.  Again, no dust defaces the room.  There is very \nlittle furniture, save a wooden table, obviously used for preparing spell\ncomponents and studying, and chair beside it in the middle of the room.\n~\n0 DPT 0\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384

The tower is filled with a sense of\nforeboding evil and you are unable to control a shiver as you survey the\nroom.  Two windows allow splinters of light into the otherwise dark room.\nThrough one window you can make out the ivory-white marble walls of\nBlackstaff's Tower.  The other gives you a view of a vast plain of clouds,\ncompletely devoid of anything but a thick, white mist.  Directly before\nyou, ebony stairs lead up to the higher levels of the tower.\n~\n0 PT 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16183\nS\n#16183\nGwenhwyvar's Living Quarters~\nThe room is sparcely furnished, with only the bare necessities gracing\nthe view of the room before you.  No dust has settled over the furniture or\nthe floor, as though it is scared to do so.  A small bed with beautiful\nblack silk sheets is in the corner.  Opposite the bed is a fireplace, its\nhearth carved of pure obsidian and its ever=present warmth takes a bit of\nthe unnatural chill from the room.  A dining table and two chairs sit off\nto one side, already set for the next meal.\n~\n0 PT 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16184\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16182\nS\n#16184\nGwenhwyvar's Laboratory~\nA chill comes over you as you walk into the circular room and the cold\nfrom the bare stone floor seems to seep through your boots into your body.\nAlthough there are no windows, it seems as though there is a cold draft.  A\nmixture of sweet, sour and bitter smells from the herbs kept for use as\nspell components occupies the room.  Bookshelves cover the walls of the\nroom from midway up the wall to the ceiling.  The bookshelves are filled\nwith large, leatherbound tomes covered with mystical runes of silver and\ngold scribed into them.  Again, no dust defaces the room.  There is very \nlittle furniture, save a wooden table, obviously used for preparing spell\ncomponents and studying, and chair beside it in the middle of the room.\n~\n0 DPT 0\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384

No dust has settled over the furniture or\nthe floor, as though it is scared to do so.  A small bed with beautiful\nblack silk sheets is in the corner.  Opposite the bed is a fireplace, its\nhearth carved of pure obsidian and its ever=present warmth takes a bit of\nthe unnatural chill from the room.  A dining table and two chairs sit off\nto one side, already set for the next meal.\n~\n0 PT 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16184\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 16182\nS\n#16184\nGwenhwyvar's Laboratory~\nA chill comes over you as you walk into the circular room and the cold\nfrom the bare stone floor seems to seep through your boots into your body.\nAlthough there are no windows, it seems as though there is a cold draft.  A\nmixture of sweet, sour and bitter smells from the herbs kept for use as\nspell components occupies the room.  Bookshelves cover the walls of the\nroom from midway up the wall to the ceiling.  The bookshelves are filled\nwith large, leatherbound tomes covered with mystical runes of silver and\ngold scribed into them.  Again, no dust defaces the room.  There is very \nlittle furniture, save a wooden table, obviously used for preparing spell\ncomponents and studying, and chair beside it in the middle of the room.\n~\n0 DPT 0\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384

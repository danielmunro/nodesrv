The floorboards creak\nsoftly as you move across the hall, admiring the many trophies from\nvictories against great beasts and evil foes, which are nailed high up on\nthe walls. Oil lanterns hang lower on the walls, lighting the dark interior of\nthe tree. The Doomsday clock is on the north wall, ticking away ominously.

You arrive in the center of the\nthree rope bridges, a guard tower surrounding a loved tree. The forest\nleaves rustle in the usual breeze and a guard casually salutes you as you\nlook around. The bridge west leads to the massive Ancient Tree. To the\nnorth, the sounds of voices are resonating from a large tree house, which\nis built comfortably between huge branches.

He started off as a warrior, and never took his\nstudies seriously.  He joined the first clan that would accept him.  Due\nto his inability to do anything, he invoked an old, little known\ndraconian spell.  It ended his life, but ressurrected him.

P. Lovecraft to Anne Rice and Stephen King.\n~\nS\n#6902\nEntrance Hall of the Apocalypse~\nYou stand in the center of a large entrance hallway. The floorboards creak\nsoftly as you move across the hall, admiring the many trophies from\nvictories against great beasts and evil foes, which are nailed high up on\nthe walls. Oil lanterns hang lower on the walls, lighting the dark interior of\nthe tree. The Doomsday clock is on the north wall, ticking away ominously. A\nsilk rope ladder hangs through a trap door, leading into the burrow below.\n A pair of open double doors lead west onto a bridge attached to another\ntree of the forest.

Others\ncontain dragon's claws, giant's eyes, rabbit's ears and other body parts of\ndifferent monsters.\n~\nS\n#6903\nApocalypse Loft~\nThis plush palacial room is at the very top of the Ancient Tree.\nOnly the highest level Riders are allowed in here. You can see portraits\nof the original Horsemen on the wall: Merlyk...DEATH of the Apocalypse,\nPell...Pestilence of the Apocalypse, Tarod...FAMINE of the Apocalypse,\nand the mighty dragon Hamlet...WAR of the Apocalypse.\n  The magical restorative properties of this loft are obvious.

You dream of crushing victories\nover foes, of outlasting hopeless sieges laid upon this eternally beautiful\nplace, and of the celebrations afterwards. You arrive in the center of the\nthree rope bridges, a guard tower surrounding a loved tree. The forest\nleaves rustle in the usual breeze and a guard casually salutes you as you\nlook around. The bridge west leads to the massive Ancient Tree. To the\nnorth, the sounds of voices are resonating from a large tree house, which\nis built comfortably between huge branches.

He started off as a warrior, and never took his\nstudies seriously.  He joined the first clan that would accept him.  Due\nto his inability to do anything, he invoked an old, little known\ndraconian spell.  It ended his life, but ressurrected him.

He started off as a warrior, and never took his\nstudies seriously.  He joined the first clan that would accept him.  Due\nto his inability to do anything, he invoked an old, little known\ndraconian spell.  It ended his life, but ressurrected him.  He started\noff fresh, 17 years old once again, and took up a new profession.\nStudying under Krill, he learnt both the ways of a thief, and the ways of\nthe Apocalypse.\n~\n0 ACD 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16385 9587 6913\nS\n#6915\nRider's Pride~\nYou are standing in a large cherry wooden room, filled\nwith prizes, awards and memorable moments that have been\nlocked into this room forever, so that future Riders may\nlook unto this room for inspiration, and guidance of upcoming\nevents that haven't yet been written.\n~\n0 CD 0\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 6902\nE\npride sign~\nPerhaps one day, your name will be added to the room?\n~\nS\n#6916\nBehind the ancient tree~\nWalking behind the ancient tree, You come across of horse farm\nof old.

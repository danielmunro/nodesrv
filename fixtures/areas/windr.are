A poorly-built\nshack lies to the north, while a more durable stone hut lies to the south.\nThe buildings continue along the trail ahead to what looks like a\ncrossroads or village square, and the trail leads back east to the dense\nforest.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17206\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17202\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door is made of hardwood planks and sturdy supports.  It would be\na tough one to break down . . . you might want to try just opening it.\n~\nE\nstone hut~\nThe hut to the south is constructed of solid stone walls with a proper,\nand well-maintained, thatch roof.  A solid wood door sits in the wall\ndirectly to your south, and the hut seems to continue to the west, where\nyou spot a window.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail continues through the trees, which are now thinning enough\nfor you to see that it leads to the west through town, and perhaps even\nwidens a little as it goes.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is a poor effort at shelter, and seems to consist of nothing\nmore than boards and branches tied to trees.  A small opening at the front\nserves as a door.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nYou'd have to go farther to the west to look into the window.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy continues to thin as you approach the center of town, and you\ncan tell that it eventually fades to the west.  You see bright shafts of\nsunlight breaking through the canopy in that direction, and the town\nlooks a lot less gloomy.\n~\nS\n#17206\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more that planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.  You might want to use the door to the south to get back on the\ntrail and out of harm's way.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nE\nwalls north east west planks~\nThe planks used to \"make\" the walls vary in size.  They also vary in\ncolor, shape and the means by which they are held together.  It's quite\nthe menagerie of construction methods.  You get the impression that a\nlot of the credit for the fact that the structure is still standing\nshould go to the vines outside, whose roots wrap tightly around anything\nexposed to the outside.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17207\nA large stone hut.~\nThe interior of the hut is dark and damp.  The stone walls are bare on the\ninside, and except for several mats on the floor there is nothing in the\nroom.  You hear voices to the west, and can see from the flickering light\naround the edges of the curtain hanging in the doorway that a fire is\nburning there.  The smell of cooking meat tempts you, but you can also\ngo through the door to the north and get on the main trail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17209\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door to the outside is made of sturdy hardwood planks.  It provides\ngood security, and, unlike most of the doors in this town, seems to have\nactually been made for the doorway it inhabits.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn of clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\ndown floor mat~\nSeveral worn reed mats lie about the floor, apparently serving as beds\nfor the current residents of the hut.\n~\nE\nroof ceiling thatch~\nLarge bundles of reeds, tied with vines, have been piled across a\ncarefully planned set of cross-supports.  This roof surely has no\nproblems with leaks.\n~\nE\nwalls south east stone~\nThe walls are constructed of square limestone blocks, obviously cut\ncarefully to fit.  You're surprised at the effort that went into them,\nand wonder if this building wasn't meant to be something more.\n~\nS\n#17208\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail approaches a small crossroads to the west, and what looks like\nit might be a fountain sits in the midst of the path in that direction.\nTo the east, the trail continues to the forest at the edge of town.  To the\nnorth is a stone building which appears to be a store of some sort, and\nto the south lies a stone hut.  The entrance to the hut is to the east,\nthough the window in front of you seems as if it might allow you to see\ninside.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17210\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nE\nletter sign~\nThe letters are difficult to make out, but with some effort, you can see\nthat the sign reads:  Blacksmith.\n~\nE\nbuilding store~\nThe building to the north looks to be a storefront, though it is in\ngreat disrepair.  The door covering the entrance is old, but appears as\nif it might still work.  As you get closer, you notice the presence of\nfaint lettering painted above the door.\n~\nE\nsouth hut~\nThe walls of the hut are in good shape, and the thick thatch roof\nsuggests some work has been done to keep this building up.  There is a door\ndown the trail to the east which seems to lead inside, and a window set\ninto the wall in front of you.  You think you see the flicker of flames\nthrough the window, but you can't be sure.\n~\nE\ndoor old~\nThe door is worn and weathered, and the hinges a bit rusty, but it\nseems likely you could still open it.\n~\nE\nup trees~\nThe sun fights its way through the boughs above and, when the branches\nget blown just the right way in the wind, the occasional warm ray of light\nreaches your face.  The canopy shows more signs of life as you move farther\nfrom the dense forests to the east.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here, and straightens out as the trees thin.  \nThe ground is a bit wet, which you attribute to the leaky fountain to the\nwest.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is very dirty, but you can make out a dimly-lit room inside\nthe hut.  There seems to be a door on the west side of the room, and\nanother on the east.  The flickering of a small fire draws your attention\nto a small hearth set into the wall.  You aren't sure, but there appears\nto be movement in the shadows.\n~\nS\n#17209\nThe kitchen of a stone hut.~\nThe kitchen of this hut is rather crude, but certainly effective.  A\nsmall hearth is set into the wall, with a variety of racks for hanging\npots and kettles.  A long countertop runs along the opposite wall, with\na series of bins for food storage beneath.  You imagine this building\nmight have once been a small cafe.  A curtain covers the entrance to the\nadjoining room to the east, and another door leads to the west.  A window\nset into the north wall admits just enough light to let you look around.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17214\nE\nsouth wall~\nThe stone walls appear to have once been carefully cut to fit.  Recent\nabuse, most likely in the form of clubs, swords and heads being bashed\ninto them, has seriously altered their appearance.  They're pitted all\nover, and large chunks are missing in several places.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof of the hut is very sturdy, and probably does a nice job of\nkeeping the place dry.\n~\nE\nwindow north~\nThrough the dirty window you can just make out the trail running east\nand west through town to the north of the hut.  Across the street you\nsee another stone building.\n~\nE\ngroove gouge~\nThe gouges look to have been made from stuff being thrown into, or at,\nthe box on a regular basis.  Maybe the stockboy wasn't too careful.\n~\nE\nbox bin~\nThe wooden box shows signs of wear, and has a number of grooves and\ngouges, both inside and out.  It is currently empty, however.\n~\nE\ncountertop~\nThe countertop is constructed of thick planking laid across a frame\nof sturdy posts.  It runs the full length of the wall, and a box has\nbeen built beneath it to serve as a storage bin.\n~\nE\nfire hearth~\nA small fire is burning in the hearth, started perhaps to prepare this\nevening's dinner.  Unfortunately, you don't see dinner itself anywhere.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn from clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\nrack pots kettle~\nA crude iron rack hangs above the fire awaiting a pot to hold over the\nfire.  The pots and kettles appear to be clean and usable, but are empty.\nApparently what you smelled from next door was yesterday's leftovers.\n~\nS\n#17210\nBennie's Blacksmith Shop.~\nYou've entered the interior of what was once clearly a blacksmith shop.\nA large hearth sits in the center of the room, providing access from\nall sides.  Rotted shelves line the walls, and a pair of tongs and a\nbillows lie rotting on the countertop.  Though the place might of once\nbeen quite busy, it appears that its better days are long past.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17208\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17212\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is slowly being overtaken by grass.  You attribute the deep\ndepression near the sliding door to the presence of horses once passing\nin and out for shoeing.  Other than this, the floor is bare--long ago\nvictim to the local scavangers.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nShafts of light pierce the weakened roof in many places, suggesting that\nthis building probably isn't very dry in the rain.  The light casts a dim\naura about the room.\n~\nE\nsliding door~\nThe sliding door to the west provides a wide berth to the street when\nopen.  It would appear that this is where Bennie once brought local\nhorses in and out of the building for shoeing.\n~\nE\neast wall~\nThe remains of a long countertop and storage shelves line the east wall.\n~\nE\nhearth~\nA circular hearth sits in the center of the room, built upon a stone\nfoundation.  The interior shows the scars of many fires, and the large\nchunks of rock missing around the edges suggest that perhaps it has\nbeen hit with a hammer repeatedly in the past.  The remains of several\nsmall fires sit in the bottom of the hearth, but you can tell it has\nbeen some time since it hosted a real blacksmith's furnace.\n~\nE\ncounter countertop~\nAt one time, a long countertop served as a workspace, running the entire\nlength of the east wall.  Like the shelves above it, though, it has been\nstripped of all useful pieces, and consists now of nothing more than a\nrotting frame.\n~\nE\nshelf shelves~\nLong, sturdy shelves at one time covered most of the interior walls in this\nbuilding, providing a massive amount of storage space.  Most of the wood\nhas long ago rotted or been removed for use elsewhere in town, though, and\nnot much remains but the frames.\n~\nE\nbillows~\nThere's not much left of the billows but the wooden frame.  It looks\nas though a leather \"bag\" for holding air might once have been attached,\nbut it has long ago rotted.  The only thing these would be useful for\nnow would be the wood scraps.\n~\nE\ntongs~\nThe tongs are old and rusted, and show the wear and tear of being thrusted\ninto the scorching flames time and time again.  Unfortunately, they aren't\nin any condition to salvage.\n~\nS\n#17211\nCrossroads at the center of town.~\nYou stand at the center of town, where the trail forms a sort of a\ncrossroad.  To the north you see a \"street\" that ends in a dead end.  The\nbuildings along each side appear to be nicer than those in the rest of\ntown.  The trail continues east and west through town, and another\nleads south, running between more buildings before it eventually leaves\ntown.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nE\ntrail~\nThe trail continues east and west to the edges of town at least.  To the\nsouth it widens a bit and appears to eventually become a road.\n~\nE\nstreet~\nThe street runs north and comes to an end at a building.  Other\nbuildings line the east and west sides.  It looks a little more promising\nthan the rest of town, and perhaps like it might have been the first\npart of town constructed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy has thinned considerably, and you can see now that the forest\nthins overhead to the west and the south.  Sunlight sneaks through in\nplaces, casting an eerie light over this part of Shadowvale.\n~\nE\ndown mud~\nYuck.  The mud has covered your boots, and you can feel the water seeping\ninto your socks . . ..\n~\nS\n#17212\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to a dead end at the wall of a stone\nbuilding several doors down.  This section of town looks somewhat more\npermanent than the rest, and the buildings are all of stone.  A wooden\ndoor leads to the building to the west, and a large sliding door provides\naccess to the stone building to the east.  To the south lies the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17210\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17217\nE\nslinding door~\nThe large wooden door hangs from a metal rail, and slides to one side\nto provide access to the building.  It would appear to be some sort\nof loading dock, or perhaps a stable door.\n~\nE\nwest structure~\nFour sturdy stone walls uphold the frame of a very old building, yet\nyou can see that the roof is in serious disrepair.  Planks have been\nstripped from the windows and awnings, most likely for use elsewhere in\ntown.  The door is battered, but is closed and probably rusted shut.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy above is much lighter, and you see small patches of sky\nbetween the boughs.  The forest thickens to the east and north, hanging\ndrearily over the edges of the village.  To the south and east it thins,\nand it looks as though the sun may actually be shining through.\n~\nE\ndown trail ground~\nThe trail here is heavily travelled.  It looks like most of the traffic\nleads to the huts at the end, as weeds grow freely along the rest of the\nbuildings.\n~\nE\neast building~\nThe building to the east looks to have once been a store of some sort.\nThe door on this side of the building is large, and slides to one side.\nIt looks like it might have been a loading dock, or maybe even a small\nstable.  A hitching post runs along the side of the building.\n~\nE\npost hitching~\nA worn branch has been mounted across two posts alongside the building.\nAt one time, judging from the considerable wear, many horses were tied\nhere on a regular basis.\n~\nS\n#17213\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail wanders west from the crossroads through another section of\ntown.  The walls of the buildings to the north and south of the crossroads\nlie to each side.  Several other buildings line the trail before it\neventually leads to the edge of town.  To the east lie the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy thins the further west you go, until it eventually\ndisappears somewhere beyond the edge of town.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is still narrow and winding along this stretch of town, but\nit would appear that it widens a bit to the west.\n~\nE\nnorth south walls~\nThe buildings to each side of the trail are made of stone and allow\nno access from this side.  You note that it looks like the roof is\ncollapsing a little on the building to the north.\n~\nS\n#17214\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail passes between two stone structures as it continues north\nand south through town.  To your north lies a small crossroads, and to\nthe south the trail leads to the edge of town.  The hut to the east is\nin good shape, but a door prevents you from seeing inside.  To the west\nlies a stone shanty.  A curtain made of a thick hide is pulled tightly\nacross the doorway, and strange markings are scrawled in red along each\nside of the entrance.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17209\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17228\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here and takes on the appearance of an actual\nroad.  It looks as though this southern route gets used often--the dirt\nis well-packed and the path free from grass.\n~\nE\nmarkings red sign~\nThe markings are in a script you don't recognize, but they have a\ndecidely evil feeling about them.  You get the impression the paint used\nto make them was probably blood . . ..\n~\nE\ncurtain hide~\nThe curtain is simply the hide of a large animal, perhaps an oxen or\nwater buffalo.  It's secured from the top, and seems to be tied loosely\nat the bottom as well.  You should be able to open it, though.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy continues to thin to the south, and the forest retreats\nsomewhat behind the buildings.  It feels a lot less enclosed here.  The\nsun breaks through the trees to warm your face, and a gentle breeze blows\nfrom the south.\n~\nE\nhut~\nThe hut is a fine, stone building.  The exterior masonry is of high \nquality, and the roof is in good shape.  You note a small quantity of smoke\nwafting from the top of the chimney.\n~\nE\nshanty~\nThe shanty is built of loosely-fitted stone which appears to be more\n\"piled\" than \"fitted\".  You can see that the roof is old, but see no\nmajor holes.  It might be a good place to rest . . . if it isn't inhabited.\n~\nS\n#17215\nThe remains of a shack.~\nYou stand in the midst of a deteriorating shack.  It appears as if it was\nonce attached to the store to the south, perhaps as workspace.  Shelves\nline the stone walls, and an old anvil stands in the corner.  The wall to\nthe west is almost entirely collapsed, providing access to the trail\noutside.  To the south a door connects to the storefront.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17210\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nLittle remains of the roof but the rafters, which are now largely\nover-grown with vines.  With a little work, you could find a sheltered\ncorner to rest in.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nGrass has started to re-take the ground inside the hut.  There is still\na lot of bare ground, and it appears as though someone has been sleeping\nhere regularly.\n~\nE\nnorth east wall shelves shelf~\nSturdy shelves have been built directly into the stone walls, providing\na significant amount of storage space.  They have long been stripped of\nanything of value they might once have held, and are home to only dust\nnow.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door isn't too sturdy, and was clearly designed to be an interior\nfixture.  It appears to be in good working condition.\n~\nS\n#17216\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to an end soon at the wall of a stone hut.\nTo the south, it leads back to the center of town.  An empty doorway leads\nto the building to the west, and the wall of the building to the east has\ncollapsed, allowing you access.  The prospects look best to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17219\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17218\nE\ndown trail~\nIt doesn't look much like anyone ever stops here.  The trail is well\nworn running north and south, but weeds cover the ground to the east and\nwest.  You note a slight rise as the trail runs north.\n~\nE\nup~\nIt's amazing how fast the canopy thickens, and a dull grey has set in\nabout you.  You can see that the edge of the forst lies just beyond the\nbuildings in all directions, and you're surprised that is hasn't yet\nengulfed the whole town.\n~\nE\ncollapsed wall rubble~\nThe remains of the wall consist of large stones and mortar.  It won't\ntake much effort to climb over it.\n~\nS\n#17217\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17218\nA sturdy lean-to.~\nAll that remains of the once proud stone building that stood here is the\nfront wall.  The back wall is partially collapsed, and is now a waist-high\npile of rubble.  Some enterprising resident has constructed a roof between\nthe two walls by laying branches and reeds across a series of slim poles.\nIt's not pretty, but it's clean and looks rather comfortable.  The trail\nlies to the east.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nnorth south~\nThe walls of the neighboring building are covered with scattered vines\nand large patches of mold.  Not very attractive, but interesting . . ..\n~\nE\nbranches reed roof ceiling~\nMost of the original branches used to create the ceiling are long-dead\nand starting to rot.  The mass of vegetation from the forest beyond has\ngrown over much of it, though, and has nicely filled gaps as they formed.\n~\nE\nrubble back~\nThe pile of rubble, which consists of mostly large blocks of stone,\nstands about chest-high to a dwarf.  You'd probably have to crawl to\nactually get back to it . . . and it certainly doesn't look like it's\nworth the effort.\n~\nS\n#17219\nThe end of the dead-end street.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the wall of a large stone structure.  It's\nhard to tell for sure, but you'd guess that the building to the north is\npart of either the building to the east or west, or maybe both.  A sturdy\noak door covers the entrance of the shack to the east, and a strong, solid\niron door blocks the entrance to the hut to your west.  You can try your\nluck with either of those, or take the trail back to the south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17220\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17223\nE\nup~\nYou feel claustrophobic beneath the shadow of the overhanging trees\nalong this end of the street.  The owners of these homes obviously didn't\nchoose the location for the wealth of sunlight it offers.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail branches neatly to the left and right to the entrances of the\ntwo buildings.  It would seem that the residents use it a lot.\n~\nE\nnorth wall~\nIt's as good a wall as you've ever seen, but that's about it.  It looks\nlike someone might even be clearing the vines off of it on occasion.\n~\nE\nsturdy oak~\nThe door is made of heavy oak planks that bear the scars of many seasons.\nIt looks like it might bear the scars of a few swordfights as well.  It's\nno worse for the wear, though, and if it's locked you won't likely be\ngetting in without a key.\n~\nE\niron~\nThis huge door is constructed of solid iron, decorated with the occasional\nrivet to hold the hinges and latch.  Considering that it's attached to a\nwindowless stone building, you imagine it might once have been a bank or\nsome other important structure.\n~\nS\n#17220\nLiving room of a small house.~\nYou can see, now that you are inside, that this shack is actually more\nof a home.  Sparse furnishings litter the room, and a picture hangs on the\nwall above a small fireplace.  It's actually rather cozy.  The front\ndoor leads back to the trail, and another door leads north to an adjoining\nroom.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17221\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17219\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nThis house has a proper roof, with relatively new planking serving to\nkeep the elements at bay.  You venture a guess that someone probably\nlives here regularly.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is nothing but packed and swept dirt, but it has aged well\nand is very clean.  You're surprised, in fact, at how clean this whole\nplace is.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls of cut stone are clean and free of the mold you see growing\non other buildings in Shadowvale.  The more you look it over, the more\nyou like this place.\n~\nE\npicture~\nA drawing of an ugly giant in a crude wood frame hangs slightly askew\non the wall.  The inscription below reads \"Brutus\".  You wonder if it's\ntrue that a mother always thinks her child is cute . . . and, if so, just\nwhat Brutus' mother might look like . . ..\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nA small stone hearth set into the stone wall flickers brightly from the\nsmall fire within.  The rack inside suggests it might also be used for\ncooking as well.\n~\nS\n#17221\nBrutus' Guest Room.~\nThis room is nicely furnished with a bed, a small nightstand and a desk.\nAgain, it is spotless.  You realize now that this is probably the guest\nquarters for the larger house across the street to the west.  This looks\nlike it would be a nice place to rest, or the door to the south will\ntake you back to the living room.\n~\n0 D 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17220\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof in this room is the same as that in the adjoining room, and it\nseems to be connected to the building next door.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor here is well-kept as well.  A nice rug made from the skin of\nsome unknown animal lies alongside the bed, and there's not a dust ball\nto be found.\n~\nE\nbed~\nThe bed is nothing but a simple cot, but it looks plenty comfortable.\n~\nE\nrug skin~\nThe hide is a dark black in color, with thick, coarse hair.  If pressed\nfor an answer, you'd guess it was from a large bear.\n~\nE\nnight stand table~\nA small wooden table serves as a nightstand next to the bed.  An oil\nlamp, built into the center of the table, provides light for the room.\n~\nE\noil lamp~\nIt's a very simple lamp, but it's unique in that it's somehow fixed\nto the table.  It's much to awkward to be of use anywhere else, and\nserves its purpose here very well.\n~\nE\nwalls north west east~\nThe stone walls are almost polished from constant brushing and cleaning.\nYou're impressed at the effort put into the upkeep of this place,\nespecially when you consider the neighborhood.\n~\nS\n#17222\nInside Windrunner's Crystal Ball~\nYou find yourself suspended in the air amidst a kaleidoscope of swirling\nmist.  After a moment, you realize you have been transferred to the inside\nof Windrunner's Crystal Ball--where he puts imputent mortals he needs to\nattend to . . ..  You feel it would be best to wait and see what he wants.\n~\n0 CDKNT 9\nO windrunner~\nE\nmist swirling~\nThe mist swirls about you in a fantastic variety of colors.  You find the\neffect almost mesmerizing.\n~\nS\n#17223\nThe entrance to Brutus' house.~\nYou've entered a small room that serves as the foyer for a rather\nlarge hut.  Actually, it's almost a house.  Several pairs of boots\nare lined neatly along the wall, and above them a series of hooks\nwait patiently for someone to hang a coat on them.  Other than this, the\nroom is bare.  You hear voices coming from the adjoining room to the\nnorth, and an iron door leads east.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17224\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17219\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe sturdy roof is constructed of heavy planking across a timber frame.\nFrom the looks of it, this house was built to endure.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor, though generally free of debris, is a bit muddy.  You hope it\ndoesn't mess up your nice boots.\n~\nE\nwest south wall~\nThe walls are made of large stone blocks, cut to fit tightly.  They are\nworn smooth with age, but remain sturdy.  Spikes have been driven into\nthem in various places to serve as hangers.\n~\nE\nspike hanger~\nIt's your basic metal spike . . . and it's driven securely into the wall.\n~\nE\niron door~\nThe heavy iron door looks a lot less imposing from the inside than it\ndid from the trail.  In fact, you're guessing it isn't solid at all, and\nis probably just a facade to fool the local \"wildlife\".\n~\nE\nboots~\nThe boots are smelly and worn, and you decide quickly you don't really\nwant to examine them further . . . ..\n~\nS\n#17224\nBrutus' Waiting Room.~\nYou are in what appears to be a waiting room, or perhaps a common room,\nfor the larger house about you.  The room is bare except for three logs\nthat serve as chairs and a picture on the wall.  A torch affixed to the\nwall provides enough light for you to see back into the entryway to the\nsouth, but, strangely, you see no other doors.  You could have sworn that\nfrom the outside this place looked a lot bigger . . ..\n  Maybe you were wrong.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17225\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17223\nE\ntorch~\nIt's a simple torch, and it's secured to the wall . . . .\n~\nE\npicture~\nA charcoal sketch of a giant, who appears to be a thief, adorns the\neast wall.  It's not life-size, but it's at least four feet in height.\nThe word \"Brutus\" is written along the bottom of the sketch.  You're\ncertain that Brutus isn't the type of guy you'd want to invite to your\nMom's house for dinner . . ..\n~\nE\nwest north wall~\nThe walls, though clean, are unadorned.  Someone must have figured they\nwere working hard enough just holding up the ceiling.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling in this room takes on a slight A-Frame appearance.  You\njudge from its construction that this room was built sometime before,\nand in a much better fashion, than the entryway to the south.\n~\nS\n#17225\nBrutus' bedroom.~\nYou've entered Brutus' private sanctuary.  A small desk sits in the corner,\nand is covered in slips of paper and ledgers.  Apparently Brutus is the\nhead honcho in these parts.  A bedroll is unrolled in front of the hearth,\nwhere a small fire warms the room.  You can exit to the west through the\nsecret door, or another door will take you north.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17226\nD3\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17224\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16451 0 11185\nE\nsecret picture~\nTo the west a hole has been roughly hewn into the wall, and you can see\nthat it's been covered with a crudely fashion door to which the picture\nwas then mounted.  Very ingenious.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt is clean, except for small piles of wood\nscraps around the hearth.  The bedroll occupies a corner of the room.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is constructed of spaced planks with wood shingles laid over\nthem.  It would seem that this isn't the orginal roof, and that perhaps\nBrutus had some work done recently.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls are made of stone and mortar.  They're discolored with age,\nbut basically in good shape.\n~\nE\nbedroll~\nThe bedroll is nothing but an old, ratty blanket, and you imagine it's\nprobably the source fo the horrible smell in the room.\n~\nE\nhearth fire~\nA small hearth is set into the wall, and a fire has recently been started.\nIt looks like Brutus was settling in for the evening.\n~\nE\nslips paper ledger~\nSeveral slips marked \"I.O.U.\" lay scattered about a large ledger.  In it\nBrutus seems to be tracking his income.  It looks like he's not only\ntrafficking in stolen merchandise, but collecting \"taxes\" from the local\nresidents as well.  From what you know about numbers, Brutus appears to\nbe doing very nicely for himself.\n~\nE\ndesk~\nIt's a small, simple desk.  It's made of wood, with a stone top.  There\nare holes in the front where drawers used to be, but Brutus seems to have\nfound little use for them.\n~\nS\n#17226\nBrutus' closet.~\nThis small closet is where Brutus probably keeps his inventory.  Too bad\nfor you his stock seems to be depleted.  The door to the south takes you\nback to the main bedroom.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17225\nD5\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17227\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling of the closet slopes steeply as it's near the edge of the\nhut.  Other than a few rope marks where someone seems to have hung something\nheavy, there's little of interest up there.\n~\nE\nnorth west east walls~\nThe closet has the same stone walls as the rest of the hut . . . what\ndid you expect?\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the closet isn't as clean as the floor of the room outside.\nIn fact, it looks a bit like the dirt has been recently disturbed . . ..\n~\nS\n#17227\nBrutus' secret storage room.~\nThat Brutus, he's a pretty smart guy.  The room has been dug beneath\nthe closet, and is rather crude.  It's big enough to store quite a bit\nof illegal merchandise in, though--even if it doesn't stay very clean.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD4\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17226\nE\nnorth south east west down walls dirt~\nThe walls are dirt, and they aren't very well-supported.  Little bits\nhave caved in here and there, and in several spots it looks like sharp\nweapons, maybe spears, were stuck into the walls for storage.  You wonder\nhow many good rains it will take until this whole end of the house sinks\ninto the ground.\n~\nE\nup secret~\nYou can see from below that the secret door is made from thick planks,\nand is laid across the top of the hole.  Brutus made it thick enough to\nseem real when he closed it and spread the dirt over it--but he just\nain't as smart as you, is he?\n~\nS\n#17228\nThe Cleric's Shanty.~\nThe small altar in the corner suggests that this shack is the home of\nthe local priest.  Other than the altar and a small cot, the room is bare\nof furnishings and possessions.

It would also seem\nthat they have tracked all sorts of dirt and other gross things in with\nthem.  You can see why the priest made the cot.\n~\nE\ncot bed~\nA simple cot, consisting of a board laid across to pieces of firewood,\nsits in the corner of the shack.  It looks really uncomfortable, but\nyou could see the advantages of it over, say, sleeping on the floor.\n~\nE\ndoor curtain hide~\nThe door to the shack consists of a simple hide nail to the upper\ncorners.  Apparently the priest trusts his clientele a little more\nthat you would.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is made of randomly over-laid planks.  The gaps\nare plugged with rags and other assorted materials, and the effort looks\nto be mildly successful.\n~\nE\nnorth west south walls~\nThe walls of the shack are simply planks, coated with a thin film of\nwhat looks like mud.  If it was an attempt at plaster, it was a very bad\none.  They do serve to keep the elements at bay, however . . ..\n~\nS\n#17229\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail continues north and south through Shadowvale.  To the north\nyou see a crossroads and what appears to be a fountain.  To the south,\nthe trail becomes a road out of town.

A flimsy door has\nbeen set into the entrance, and a small window sits off to one side of\nthe door.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the trees above in various places, dispelling\nsome of the eerie shadows from the trees above.  This place is still\ndefinitely on the wierd side of creepy, though.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is covered in dirt.  As you wipe a spot clean, you note that\nthe curtains are drawn and you can't see in anyway.\n~\nE\ndoor flimsy~\nThe door most likely keeps out nothing but the rain.  Still, it'd be\neasier to open it than to kick it in . . ..\n~\nS\n#17230\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more than planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.

They are spotted with pieces of cloth, hide and anything\nelse that was available to keep out the rain.\n~\nE\nnorth east south walls~\nThe walls, such as they are, are a conglomeration of materials put\ntogether as availability and need dictated.  \"Mess\" is the first word\nthat comes to mind.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17231\nThe common shack.~\nThis well-maintained shack seems to serve as a common home to a variety\nof Shadowdale's residents.  Several bedrolls cover the floor, and gear\nof all kinds sits about the room.  You get the feeling, however, that the\nresidents wouldn't be ideal roommates . . ..

Not \nmuch, but it's a dry place to sleep.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is mostly branches woven into a tight sheet.\nYou get the feeling it probably leaks when it rains.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe doors of this shack are simply weather-worn planks tied together\nalong cross-supports.  You could probably put your fist through them if\nyou had to, but it would be easier just to open them . . .\n~\nE\nnorth south wall~\nThe walls of the shack are simple, unadorned planks, many of which seem\nto have come from other buildings . . ..\n~\nE\ngear~\nA variety of gear in states of general mis-use lie about the room.  While\nsome of it may once have been useful, it's all junk now.\n~\nE\nbed bedrolls~\nSeveral piles of hides lie scattered about the room serving as beds.\nThey look as if they are used regularly.\n~\nS\n#17232\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail winds between two more buildings before it leads south out of\ntown.  As it leaves town, the trail leads slowly down into a wide valley.\nThe trees continue to thin in that direction, and you can't be sure, but\nyou think you see the glint of sunlight reflecting off water far down in\nthe valley.  The trail leads north back into town.  To the west are the\ncharred remains of a burned-out building, and to the east a sturdy, well-\nbuilt shack.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17233\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17235\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17234\nE\nshack hut east~\nThe hut to the east is constructed mostly of stone.  \"Patches\" of planks,\nmortar, branches and vines cover holes where larger stones have broken\nloose from the foundation.  The repairs look almost as sturdy as the\nremaining foundation, if not moreso.  It's clearly an old building, but\nsomeone is making an effort to keep it well-maintained.\n  A solid oak door is set into the doorway, blocking your view inside.\n~\nE\nvine patch mortar branch~\nSomeone seems to have patched holes in the foundation of the hut with\na mixture of muddy mortar and branches.  Vines have taken root, providing\nan overlying web of flora.  The patches give the hut a very \"earthy\"\nappearance, almost like a large, moss-covered rock with a nice patch\nof sod growing on top.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is well-trodden here, and it appears many pairs of boots have\nmade the journey south.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun struggles to break through the canopy here, and it appears to\nbe having much more success to the south.  You see birds among the boughs\nof the oaks again, and the chatter of squirrels filters down from far\nabove.\n~\nE\ndoor oak plank~\nThe door to this hut has been cut from a single width of hard oak\nplanking.  It looks very secure, which is good, but rare, in this\nneighborhood.  If it's locked, it would probably be easier to cut a\nhole in the wall than to break it down.\n~\nS\n#17233\nA well-built hut.~\nYou have entered a very comfortable shack.  Though the only furniture\nis a bed in one corner, the shack appears to have been recently cleaned.\nThe walls are solid, and the roof is strong enough to keep out the rain.\nWhat a wonderful place to hide away and rest.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17232\nE\noak plank~\nThe door looks as solid from the inside as it did from outside.  You\nadmire the beautiful grain of the wood . . .\n~\nE\nup~\nThe hut has a sod roof, supported by long, straight limbs culled from\nthe surrounding forest.  Someone did a very nice job of building it.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor of the hut is basically hard-packed dirt.  However, it's\npacked very well, and is almost as solid as stone.\n~\nE\nwalls east north south~\nThe walls of the hut consist of a waist-high stone foundation and smooth\nplanks above that.  They are entirely bare, and could use some decoration.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe door looks just as good inside, and is in very good shape.  If you\nwere to close it, it would probably keep unwanted characters out.\n~\nS\n#17234\nThe remains of a burned building.~\nYou stand amidst the charred ruins of what once might have been a very\nnice shack.  There certainly was a lot of wood in it, as the ashes are\nknee deep and charcoal beams still attempt to hold a roof that no longer\nexists.  You might find something if you rummage, but the place looks\nlike it's been well-scavanged.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\nvegetation forest vines~\nBranches from the forest beyond have grown through the remaining wall\nsupports, protruding into the room.  Large vines have used the branches\nto bridge their way in as well, and are slowly overtaking the area.  You\nare amazed at the resilience of the forest behind the building, and can't\neven imagine how horrible it would be to get stuck in it.\n~\nE\nashes ruins~\nDeep piles of gray ashes, matted into flat mounds by wind and rain,\nprovide an eerie backdrop for the grim black beams which rise like the\ntrees on some lost desert plain.  This place is creepy, even by local\nstandards.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest has already begun to reclaim the back wall of the house.  The\nvines have made themselves at home on the remaining wall supports, and\nhave created an impassable wall of vegetation.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nA short stone foundation survived on the southern side of the lot, \ndefiantly supporting the last remains of the only thing that can be clearly\nidentified as a wall.  Through the remains you can see that the forest\nappears to thin to the south, and you see the trail leading south into\nthe woods just in front of the building.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nThe owners of the building to the north seem to have salvaged a lot of\nthe useful materials from this site, and used them to re-build their\nsouthern wall.  They didn't do a very good job, though, and none of the\npieces fit together.  Cracks and holes appear all over.\n~\nE\nhole crack~\nYou can make out faint shapes inside the shack.  It's too dark to be\nsure, but judging from the whispering and sounds of shuffling, it sounds\nlike the residents might be home . . . and there's more than one person\nat home.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe gray ashes are a little damp, and are making a mess of your boots.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is much thinner here than at the northern edges of town, and\nthe occasional ray of sun sneaks through.  It appears that the trees\ncontinue to thin to the south.\n~\nS\n#17235\nA trail leading south out of town.~\nYou stand on the southern edge of the small village of Shadowvale.  The\ntown, which spreads out to your north, has a dark and menacing feel about\nit--even here you feel many eyes watching you.  The road continues north\ninto town, or south to the thinner forest and, eventually, foreign realms.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\ndown trail road~\nThe road is clear and well-marked as it leaves town to the south.  To\nthe north, it appears to lead into the heart of the village.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe thin forest to the west holds little of interest for you, though you\ndo see the remains of a burned-out building to the west of your trail--\nright on the edge of the approaching village.\n~\nE\neast~\nYou see a shack sitting along the east side of the road just north of here,\nmarking the entrance to a village.  The forest is just thin enough that\nyou could leave the trail without getting too horribly lost, but you see\nnothing of interest that would justify the effort.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun beams down upon you brightly as you look up to see squirrels\nplaying among the trees.

An empty lot lies to your north, and you can see\na small grove of pine trees lying just beyond.  To your south are the\nremains of an old shack.  The trail to the west leads to the edge of town,\nand there appears to be a crossroads further into town to the east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17237\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is almost clear at this spot.

It might still\nprovide shelter . . . if you can wedge yourself into a dry corner.  The\ndoorway is empty, the door long-ago stolen for some other housing project.\n~\nS\n#17237\nA campsite in an empty lot.~\nThis vacant lot has been used as a campsite so many times that it has\ntaken on a permanent appearance.  The remains of several fires are\nscattered about the site, and a pine grove that begins on the north\nend of the lot provides nice cover for sleeping.  You can go into the\ngrove to your north, or to the trail through town to the south.

You can make out a clearing to the north in the pine\ngrove, and taller weeds along the walls on each side of the lot provide\nnice protection from the wind.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest has thinned to only scattered trees, and the sun beams down\nupon the lot.  Shade can be gained under the pines to the north, and you\ncan see the forest rising above the far side of the grove.\n~\nE\neast west wall~\nA barrier of weeds and shrubs rings the lot along the edges of the\nneighboring buildings.  The walls appear to be solid and offer no access\nto the inside of either structure.\n~\nE\ncampfire fire~\nSeveral blackened circles surrounded with stones are scattered about\nthe lot.  Half-burned logs, apparently from the pine forest, lie rotting\naround the edges of each site.\n~\nS\n#17238\nA small pine grove.~\nYou have wandered into a small pine grove tucked away behind the homes\nin this area.  The underbrush has been tamed in this clearing, and the\nfresh scent of the small pines is quite refreshing.  The grove continues\nto your north and west.  To your east lies the back wall of a shack, and\nto the south a campsite.

They provide\nnice shelter for the grove, though they aren't much for climbing.\n~\nE\nwall shack east~\nThe wall of the shack is overgrown with flowery vines.  There do not\nappear to be any windows or other distinguishing features.\n~\nE\nflowery vines~\nThe vines appear to be from the morning glory family.  They cover the\nwall in thick patterns, sprouting patches of beautiful purple teacup\nshaped flowers here and there.  Insects and small birds play contentedly\nin the cover they provide.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe bed of pine needles which covers the ground is quite thick.  There\nare patches here and there where piles of needles have been gathered, most\nlikely for use in building fire.  The softness of the ground is a welcome\ntreat for your aching feet.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe boughs of the pines dance lightly in the wind overhead.  Birds and\nsquirrels ramble aimlessly among the branches searching for food.\n~\nS\n#17239\nA small pine grove.~\nThe serenity of the pine grove calms your anxieties as you venture\ndeeper within.  The heavy undergrowth of the forest once again rises to\nchoke out the pines and block passage to the north, and the back of\na house lies to your east.  The grove continues west and south . . . \nsuddenly, a loud cry captures your attention, and it appears to be coming\nfrom the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nE\npine tree~\nYou're amazed that these little trees do so well in the midst of the\ndark forest.

You make a mental note\nof the house's location so as not to accidentally wander in on them.\n~\nE\neast house shack~\nThe house to the east appears to be constructed of stone, and is in\nvery good shape.  Vines cover the back wall, but you can make out a window\nhidden behind a patch of flowers.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe soft needles here are not as nice as the ones at the entrance to\nthe grove . . . mushrooms, vines and other offshoots frmo the forest\nfight for a foothold.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy of the neighboring forest towers above the edge of the grove,\nreminding you again of the ominous nature of the entire village.

It looks pretty spooky anyway . . ..\n~\nE\ntree pine~\nThe pine tree stands alone in the corner of the clearing, as if holding\noff the forest by itself.  It provides a perfect perch for the owl to\nsurvey the grove, and plenty of room to swoop quickly down upon its\nunsuspecting dinner guests.\n~\nE\nnest~\nThe owl's nest looks to be about a yard in width, and is constructed\nof twigs and leaves wedged into a deep hole in the tree.  It sits just\nout of your reach . . . and the tree offers no branches for you to climb.\n~\nE\nskeleton~\nThe skeleton appears to be that of a rat, or perhaps a small cat.  It\nis about the right size for an owl's dinner.  It's best left alone.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe ground is relatively clear here--a perfect area for an owl's\nhunting grounds.  A small skeleton lies half-covered in pine needles,\nbut you see no other signs that anyone has been here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest hangs precariously above the pine grove, drowning out most\nof the light.  Besides the owl's nest, there are few signs of life here.\n~\nS\n#17241\nA small pine grove.~\nThis corner of the pine grove is very pleasant, and is by far the\nbrightest.  The forest closes in to block passage to the west, and adds\nan ominous gloom to an otherwise nice place.  The wall of a stone building\nlies to your south, and the pine grove runs to the east and north.  You\nhear a strange, hair-tingling shriek in the latter direction.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nE\ndown needles~\nThere are signs that others have been here before you.  The needles\nshow places where several others have rested, at least one of whom was\nbleeding . . . the trail of blood leads off to the north.\n~\nE\nstone wall house building~\nThe back of the house is simply a rock wall, offering no windows or\ndoors for passage.\n~\nE\nwest forest undergrowth~\nThough it appears that the forest thins a bit to the west, there's no\nway you're going to get there from here to find out.  It's almost as if\nsomeone has been encouraging the forest to form a wall . . . it's hard\nto believe it could be so consistently unpassable on it's own.\n~\nE\nbirds~\nThe birds appear to be only sparrows, and they're far out of your\nreach.  There's probably a better meal to be had somewhere else.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou spot several birds fluttering around amongst the pines, and hear\nthe distinct sounds of squirrels playing out of sight.\n~\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees provide a nice amount of cover here, and it would be a\nwonderful place to kick back and ponder the mysteries of life . . ..\n~\nS\n#17242\nThe remains of a shack.~\nThis shack has pretty much reached the end of its useful life.  The\nroof has collapsed in upon the interior, and most anything of use was\nlong ago stripped and salvaged.  You can climb across the rubble, where\na small clearing seems to sit in back of the building to the south, or\nexit to the path through town to the north.  To the east lies the exterior\nwall of a sturdy building, and to the west you see a hide-covered hut,\nbut no way to enter it.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nE\neast building wall~\nThe bare face of a stone wall forms the back of the building to the east.\nThere would appear to be no access from this side.\n~\nE\nwest hide hut~\nTo the west you can just make out what looks like an igloo made of\nanimal skins tucked within the trees.  However, you can't tell much more\nthan that from this vantage point.\n~\nE\nrubble~\nThe rubble would appear to be the remains of a rock wall which fell\nvictim to the elements some time ago.  It is now only a waist-high pile\nof rocks and boards.  You should be able to climb over it easily to get\nto the clearing beyond.\n~\nE\ndown~\nGrass and a variety of weeds have started to re-establish themselves now\nthat the shack has collapsed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees have thinned overhead, but the sun isn't at the proper angle\nto reach this particular lot.  Too bad, the grass could use some help.\n~\nS\n#17243\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYour attention is immediately drawn to the hut to the south, which appears\nto be constructed of animal hides and stands out awkwardly from the forest.\nTo your north is the stone wall of an old hut, the entrance of which lies\nfurther to the west.  The edge of town lies to your west, and the trail\neast will take you into the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17247\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\nhut hide~\nFrom the trail, it looks as though the hut is made of a large segment\nof leather pulled taught over some sort of from.  Further inspection\nmight provide more insights.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou are clearly near the western edge of the forest, as the trees become\nmuch thicker, and ominously darker, the further east you look.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-packed and dry.  It looks like many pairs of\nfeet, and in some cases multiple pairs, have used the trail recently.\n~\nE\nwall stone~\nExcept for a few small vines and some patches of fungus, the stone wall\nis bare.  You can tell from the outside that the door to this building is\nthe one just west of here.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nYou'll have to go a little farther west down the trail to see the door\nproperly.\n~\nS\n#17244\nA storage closet.~\nThe closet is very plain.  Several nails have been pounded into the\nwalls to serve as hooks, and the floor is scratched from the occasional\ntrunk that has been dragged in and out.  It is otherwise very clean\nand somewhat secure.  It's value as a hideout might outweigh its\noriginal purpose.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17245\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is simply a series of planks embedded in the ground, but it's\nlevel and dry.  It would certainly be among the cleaner places you've\nrested today . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of the hut appears to be made of planks, sealed here and there\nwith patches of sod.  It's not much, but it would likely keep you dry\nin the rain.\n~\nE\neast north south walls~\nThe walls are bare, but sturdy.\n~\nE\ndoor west~\nThe door separates the closet from the main room of the shack.  When\nclosed, it provides decent privacy.\n~\nS\n#17245\nThe Warrior's Shack.~\nYou have entered a well-kept shack that appears to belong to a warrior\nwho has taken up long-term residence in Shadowvale.  Though plain and\nunfurnished, the stone walls provide protection from the elements and,\nwell, at least the door works.  The trail through town lies to the\nsouth, and a door is set into the eastern wall.\n~\n0 D 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17244\nD2\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17246\nE\nnorth west walls~\nThe stone walls are well-constructed, and on the inside, at least, are\nin good shape.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of this shack actually has shingles, though light shows \nthrough in the corners of the room.  It's better than sleeping in the rain.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in oak planking.  It's worn, but not deteriorating.\nIt's certainly good enough to keep most of the bugs out of your bedroll.\n~\nE\ndoor east~\nThe door to the east isn't as solid as the exterior door, and appears\nto lead to a storage room or closet.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door to the outside is quite sturdy, and will definitely keep out\nwandering fidos and other undesirables.\n~\nS\n#17246\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYou stand at the western-most edge of a small village tucked within\nthe forest.  The town spreads out to the east, hidden beneath the quickly\ndarkening forest.  An air of gloom hangs over the grove, and you see\nlittle movement in the streets.  To your north lies an entrance to\na sturdy stone hut, but a wooden door blocks any view inside.  To your\nsouth is a dilapitated shack--the door is closed, but you can't imagine\nwhy anyone would bother.  The trail leaves town to your west, and leads\ninto the center of town (as well as the deeper forest) to your east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17245\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17248\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17249\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens as it leaves town to the west.  To the east, it becomes\nnarrower as it winds between the scattered buildings and trees.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is open and airy above you, and squirrels frolic among the\nboughs.  You can see that the trees slowly fade to the west, while to the\neast the canopy thickens and eventually fades into darkness.\n~\nE\nsouth shack~\nThe dilapitated shack to the south appears ready to collapse in on\nitself.  The walls are old and rotted, and large chunks of the roof\nare missing.  The well-worn path to the door suggests that someone\nis still using it regularly, despite its condition.\n~\nE\nwooden door~\nIt's a wooden door--your time would be better spent trying to open it.\n~\nE\nnorth stone hut~\nThe sturdy hut is built from cut limestone and looks to be kept up\nregularly.  You judge from the building pattern that it probably also\nextends to the east, but you see no entrance in that direction.  The\nwooden door is closed, but looks like it probably works.\n~\nS\n#17247\nA hut covered in animal hides.~\nHides have been stretched across a frame of bent branches to form a\ndomed hut among the trees.  The floor is clean and dry, and someone\nhas recently been building fires in the center of the room.  A shaft\nof sunlight pierces the hole in the roof which serves as a chimney,\nand casts a dim light about the room.  The doorway to the north leads\nback to the trail.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nstraw pile~\nIt would seem the current occupant is using the pile of straw as a bed.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt has been carefully maintained.  It is smooth\nand, except for a pile of straw in the corner, free of debris.\n~\nE\nhole up~\nYou can just make out the boughs of the trees as the wind blows them\nback and forth above the hut.  The hole is about a dagger's length\nacross--just enough to draw the smoke out, and not enough to let the\nrain in.\n~\nE\nbranches~\nThe branches appear to be taken from willow trees.  About a dozen of\nthem rise around the edge of the cirular shelter, and are tied with\ntwine where they meet at the top.\n~\nE\nhide walls skins~\nThe hides appear to be from a wide variety of animals.  Large skins,\nmost likely from wolves and bears, form the majority of the structure,\nand smaller skins have been used to fill the gaps.  Overall, the work\nis excellent.\n~\nS\n#17248\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17249\nThe trail leading out of Shadowvale.~\nThe trail leads east into a small village hidden within the edge of\nthe forest.  To the west the forest thins and eventually fades altogether.\nSquirrels and other wildlife play in the light cover near the trail, and\nyou can hear the chatter of birds in the surrounding canopy.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail looks well-travelled to the east toward town, but fades here\nand can't be seen to the west.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest thins to the west, but you can't make out the lands beyond.\nThe trail ends here, however, so there can't be too much out there . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the canopy in many places, leaving misty trails\nas it seeks out the ground below.  You notice the eerie contrast with\nthe forest to the east, which quickly becomes dark and menacing.\n~\nE\nnorth south forest~\nThe forest around you consists of random trees scattered among a low\ncovering of bushes and vines.  It has a rather cheerful feel about it,\nand you note a wide range of scents in the air.\n~\nS\n#17250\nA small clearing in the woods.~\nA small clearing has been created just behind the shacks along this\nrow.  Piles of garbage sit rotting along the edge of the forest, which\ncloses quickly in against the southern and western edges of the lot.\nThere are signs of a trail entering the underbrush to the west, but it\nis difficult to make out where it might go.  The back door of a shack\nlies to your east, and the remains of a fallen building lie north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD1\nExit ~\nback door east~\n16387 0 17231\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nE\ndown~\nThe clearing is covered in a soft, green turf.  If it weren't for the\nstink of rotting garbage, it'd be a nice place to rest for awhile.\n~\nE\nup~\nNo trees grow in the lot, and the refreshing glow of sunlight enhances\nthe area.  You can tell from the canopy though that this might be the only\nsunny spot for some distance in any direction.\n~\nE\ntrail west~\nThere appears to be a path leading into the forest at the western edge\nof the clearing, but the undergrowth is so heavy it is hard to be sure.\n~\nE\npile garbage~\nIt looks as if someone has been tossing the remains of meals, and perhaps\nworse, along the edges of this lot.  Even if there was something of value\nburied deep in there, you doubt it's worth enough to dig around and find\nit.\n~\nE\nback door east~\nThe door is simply a variety of random boards and planks tied together\nwith string and vines.  Nice effort, but certainly better at keeping\nout the wind than hearty adventurers like yourself.\n~\nS\n#17251\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail plunges into the forest, and the vegetation immediately\npresses in against you.  It appears that the trail continues south, and\nreturns east to the clearing.\n~\n0 A 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17252\nE\ndown trail~\nThe ground is covered in vegetation, and vines reach out to snag your\nfeet and armor.  The trail is faint, but after a few seconds you can\nsee that it clearly goes south, if anywhere . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest above is so thick that light can hardly penetrate.  The\nlower branches are covered in vines, and you can't see any further into\nthe forest in this direction than in any other.\n~\nE\nwest north forest underbrush~\nThe undergrowth is thick in this part of the forest.  You think the\nbacks of the buildings along the main trail should be to your north, but\nit is impossible to see more than several feet into the vegetation.\nThe trail is the only possible means of passage through this area.\n~\nS\n#17252\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the forest edge.  Vegetation presses in\nfrom the south, east and west preventing further passage.  A strange bush\nprotruding from the forest edge to the west captures your attention.\n~\n0 A 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17253\nE\ndown~\nThick sod, covered in leaves and decaying branches, covers the forest\nfloor.  You feel you should watch carefully where you are walking so\nas not to entangle yourself in the vines.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees grow low over the path, and the vines growing from the\nbranches hang just out of reach.  A wave of claustrophobia overcomes\nyou, and you feel the urge to turn and run.\n~\nE\nsouth east forest underbrush~\nThe underbrush almost reaches out from the forest to draw you in.  You\nhear the cries of a wide variety of wildlife from beyond the edge of the\ntrees, but you can't imagine what would live in such darkness.  You can't,\nthat's for sure . . . you might as well turn around and head back.\n~\nE\nhandle~\nThe handle is too deep in the bush to see.  Perhaps if you opened\nthe bush . . . \n~\nE\nmetal inside~\nThere appears to be a fence inside the bush.  As you investigate further,\nyou notice that the bush gives slightly under your weight.  You feel what\ncould be a handle of some sort . . .\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nAt first glance, the bush appears to be dying.  The leaves have all\ndried out, and the whole thing seems to almost sway and flap in the wind\n . . . almost as if it were hanging.  You see the faint glint of sunlight\nstriking metal deep inside.\n~\nS\n#17253\nThe hidden hut.~\nYou've gained entrance to a hut hidden within the underbrush at the\nedge of the forest.  It is constructed primarily of sod, and has the feel\nof an igloo--but it obviously wasn't built for comfort.  It is clearly\na temporary hideout of some sort, and amenities aren't apparently a\npriority to the owner.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17252\nE\ndown floor~\nSomeone has made an effort to at least pack the dirt on the ground into\nsomething resembling a floor.  Grass still grows in places, but it isn't\ndoing well in the absence of sunlight.\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nFrom the inside, you can see that someone has simply uprooted an\nentire bush and built a wire door frame through the middle.  The bush\nthen hangs from the frame, and from the outside, appears to still be\nhappily anchored in the soil.  You admire the genius that came up with\nthis idea.\n~\nE\n~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\nup branches vines~\nThe branches and vines that form the ceiling provide an interesting\nmaze at which to stare while you lie on your back awaiting sleep.\n~\nE\nwalls west south north sod~\nThe sod was cut from the ground and stacked into piles about 8 feet in\nheight.  A series of branches were added across the top of the room, and\nvines were allowed to grow across them as a \"roof\".  Not exactly the\nbuilding materials you'd choose for a honeymoon suite, but they serve\ntheir current purpose well . . . finding and getting into this hut is\ncertainly a challenge.\n~\nS\n#17254\nA path in the forest.~\nThe forest deepens to the west, and appears nearly impassable.  The trail\ncontinues in that direction though, as well as returning to the east.  The\nvegetation presses in from the north and south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17200\nS\n#17255\nA path through the forest.~\nThe path leads west from here, directly into the heart of the darkest\npart of the forest.  You notice an odd \"stillness\" about the trail in\nthat direction.  The forest pushes in from the south and east, preventing\npassage in those directions altogether.  To the north, the forest thins\nconsiderably.\n~\n0 0 3\nH 200 M 200\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17256\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17254\nE\nsouth east forest vegetation~\nYou note that the trees are becoming larger and older as you move to\nthe west.  Thick underbrush and massive vines block passage to the south\nand east, forcing the trail to turn to the west and north.\n~\nE\nup~\nBeams of sunlight burst through the canopy above, giving the forest about\nyou an eerie glow.  You can see that as you move west, the light disappears\ncompletely, and to the east the forest appears to be thinner.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail turns north and west here, forced to change course by the\nthickening underbrush.\n~\nS\n#17256\nThe path into the forest.~\nThe forest rises in a thick wall to the west.  Large vines and thick\nunderbrush provide an eerie backdrop to the deepeing darkness in that\ndirection.  The trail continues south, plunging into the edge of the\ndeeper woods, and to the east leads to a crossroads.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 3510\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nE\nnorth west vines underbrush forest~\nWhile the forest to the east is relatively clear, the forest to the\nwest is a mass of vegetation.  Thick, dark tree trunks rise far above you\nand squeak with a menacing tone as they sway in wind.  Large vines and\nbrambles grow between them, creating an impenetrable mass.  You can't\nimagine what kind of creatures would make their homes here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest seems to lean over you from the west, almost as it if plans\nto engulf you as a lunchtime snack.  The sun still finds the occasional\nhole to poke through here, but you can see it's having much better luck\nto the east.  Perhaps you would too . . ..\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail thins as it enters the forest to the south, but the hard-\npacked dirt suggests that it does, in fact, get travelled.

A solid wood door sits in the wall\ndirectly to your south, and the hut seems to continue to the west, where\nyou spot a window.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail continues through the trees, which are now thinning enough\nfor you to see that it leads to the west through town, and perhaps even\nwidens a little as it goes.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is a poor effort at shelter, and seems to consist of nothing\nmore than boards and branches tied to trees.

You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17207\nA large stone hut.~\nThe interior of the hut is dark and damp.  The stone walls are bare on the\ninside, and except for several mats on the floor there is nothing in the\nroom.  You hear voices to the west, and can see from the flickering light\naround the edges of the curtain hanging in the doorway that a fire is\nburning there.

This roof surely has no\nproblems with leaks.\n~\nE\nwalls south east stone~\nThe walls are constructed of square limestone blocks, obviously cut\ncarefully to fit.  You're surprised at the effort that went into them,\nand wonder if this building wasn't meant to be something more.\n~\nS\n#17208\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail approaches a small crossroads to the west, and what looks like\nit might be a fountain sits in the midst of the path in that direction.\nTo the east, the trail continues to the forest at the edge of town.  To the\nnorth is a stone building which appears to be a store of some sort, and\nto the south lies a stone hut.

The door covering the entrance is old, but appears as\nif it might still work.  As you get closer, you notice the presence of\nfaint lettering painted above the door.\n~\nE\nsouth hut~\nThe walls of the hut are in good shape, and the thick thatch roof\nsuggests some work has been done to keep this building up.  There is a door\ndown the trail to the east which seems to lead inside, and a window set\ninto the wall in front of you.

The canopy shows more signs of life as you move farther\nfrom the dense forests to the east.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here, and straightens out as the trees thin.  \nThe ground is a bit wet, which you attribute to the leaky fountain to the\nwest.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is very dirty, but you can make out a dimly-lit room inside\nthe hut.  There seems to be a door on the west side of the room, and\nanother on the east.  The flickering of a small fire draws your attention\nto a small hearth set into the wall.  You aren't sure, but there appears\nto be movement in the shadows.\n~\nS\n#17209\nThe kitchen of a stone hut.~\nThe kitchen of this hut is rather crude, but certainly effective.  A\nsmall hearth is set into the wall, with a variety of racks for hanging\npots and kettles.  A long countertop runs along the opposite wall, with\na series of bins for food storage beneath.  You imagine this building\nmight have once been a small cafe.  A curtain covers the entrance to the\nadjoining room to the east, and another door leads to the west.  A window\nset into the north wall admits just enough light to let you look around.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17214\nE\nsouth wall~\nThe stone walls appear to have once been carefully cut to fit.  Recent\nabuse, most likely in the form of clubs, swords and heads being bashed\ninto them, has seriously altered their appearance.  They're pitted all\nover, and large chunks are missing in several places.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof of the hut is very sturdy, and probably does a nice job of\nkeeping the place dry.\n~\nE\nwindow north~\nThrough the dirty window you can just make out the trail running east\nand west through town to the north of the hut.  Across the street you\nsee another stone building.\n~\nE\ngroove gouge~\nThe gouges look to have been made from stuff being thrown into, or at,\nthe box on a regular basis.  Maybe the stockboy wasn't too careful.\n~\nE\nbox bin~\nThe wooden box shows signs of wear, and has a number of grooves and\ngouges, both inside and out.  It is currently empty, however.\n~\nE\ncountertop~\nThe countertop is constructed of thick planking laid across a frame\nof sturdy posts.  It runs the full length of the wall, and a box has\nbeen built beneath it to serve as a storage bin.\n~\nE\nfire hearth~\nA small fire is burning in the hearth, started perhaps to prepare this\nevening's dinner.  Unfortunately, you don't see dinner itself anywhere.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn from clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\nrack pots kettle~\nA crude iron rack hangs above the fire awaiting a pot to hold over the\nfire.  The pots and kettles appear to be clean and usable, but are empty.\nApparently what you smelled from next door was yesterday's leftovers.\n~\nS\n#17210\nBennie's Blacksmith Shop.~\nYou've entered the interior of what was once clearly a blacksmith shop.\nA large hearth sits in the center of the room, providing access from\nall sides.  Rotted shelves line the walls, and a pair of tongs and a\nbillows lie rotting on the countertop.  Though the place might of once\nbeen quite busy, it appears that its better days are long past.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17208\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17212\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is slowly being overtaken by grass.  You attribute the deep\ndepression near the sliding door to the presence of horses once passing\nin and out for shoeing.  Other than this, the floor is bare--long ago\nvictim to the local scavangers.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nShafts of light pierce the weakened roof in many places, suggesting that\nthis building probably isn't very dry in the rain.  The light casts a dim\naura about the room.\n~\nE\nsliding door~\nThe sliding door to the west provides a wide berth to the street when\nopen.  It would appear that this is where Bennie once brought local\nhorses in and out of the building for shoeing.\n~\nE\neast wall~\nThe remains of a long countertop and storage shelves line the east wall.\n~\nE\nhearth~\nA circular hearth sits in the center of the room, built upon a stone\nfoundation.  The interior shows the scars of many fires, and the large\nchunks of rock missing around the edges suggest that perhaps it has\nbeen hit with a hammer repeatedly in the past.  The remains of several\nsmall fires sit in the bottom of the hearth, but you can tell it has\nbeen some time since it hosted a real blacksmith's furnace.\n~\nE\ncounter countertop~\nAt one time, a long countertop served as a workspace, running the entire\nlength of the east wall.  Like the shelves above it, though, it has been\nstripped of all useful pieces, and consists now of nothing more than a\nrotting frame.\n~\nE\nshelf shelves~\nLong, sturdy shelves at one time covered most of the interior walls in this\nbuilding, providing a massive amount of storage space.  Most of the wood\nhas long ago rotted or been removed for use elsewhere in town, though, and\nnot much remains but the frames.\n~\nE\nbillows~\nThere's not much left of the billows but the wooden frame.  It looks\nas though a leather \"bag\" for holding air might once have been attached,\nbut it has long ago rotted.  The only thing these would be useful for\nnow would be the wood scraps.\n~\nE\ntongs~\nThe tongs are old and rusted, and show the wear and tear of being thrusted\ninto the scorching flames time and time again.  Unfortunately, they aren't\nin any condition to salvage.\n~\nS\n#17211\nCrossroads at the center of town.~\nYou stand at the center of town, where the trail forms a sort of a\ncrossroad.  To the north you see a \"street\" that ends in a dead end.  The\nbuildings along each side appear to be nicer than those in the rest of\ntown.  The trail continues east and west through town, and another\nleads south, running between more buildings before it eventually leaves\ntown.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nE\ntrail~\nThe trail continues east and west to the edges of town at least.  To the\nsouth it widens a bit and appears to eventually become a road.\n~\nE\nstreet~\nThe street runs north and comes to an end at a building.  Other\nbuildings line the east and west sides.  It looks a little more promising\nthan the rest of town, and perhaps like it might have been the first\npart of town constructed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy has thinned considerably, and you can see now that the forest\nthins overhead to the west and the south.  Sunlight sneaks through in\nplaces, casting an eerie light over this part of Shadowvale.\n~\nE\ndown mud~\nYuck.  The mud has covered your boots, and you can feel the water seeping\ninto your socks . . ..\n~\nS\n#17212\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to a dead end at the wall of a stone\nbuilding several doors down.  This section of town looks somewhat more\npermanent than the rest, and the buildings are all of stone.  A wooden\ndoor leads to the building to the west, and a large sliding door provides\naccess to the stone building to the east.  To the south lies the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17210\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17217\nE\nslinding door~\nThe large wooden door hangs from a metal rail, and slides to one side\nto provide access to the building.  It would appear to be some sort\nof loading dock, or perhaps a stable door.\n~\nE\nwest structure~\nFour sturdy stone walls uphold the frame of a very old building, yet\nyou can see that the roof is in serious disrepair.  Planks have been\nstripped from the windows and awnings, most likely for use elsewhere in\ntown.  The door is battered, but is closed and probably rusted shut.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy above is much lighter, and you see small patches of sky\nbetween the boughs.  The forest thickens to the east and north, hanging\ndrearily over the edges of the village.  To the south and east it thins,\nand it looks as though the sun may actually be shining through.\n~\nE\ndown trail ground~\nThe trail here is heavily travelled.  It looks like most of the traffic\nleads to the huts at the end, as weeds grow freely along the rest of the\nbuildings.\n~\nE\neast building~\nThe building to the east looks to have once been a store of some sort.\nThe door on this side of the building is large, and slides to one side.\nIt looks like it might have been a loading dock, or maybe even a small\nstable.  A hitching post runs along the side of the building.\n~\nE\npost hitching~\nA worn branch has been mounted across two posts alongside the building.\nAt one time, judging from the considerable wear, many horses were tied\nhere on a regular basis.\n~\nS\n#17213\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail wanders west from the crossroads through another section of\ntown.  The walls of the buildings to the north and south of the crossroads\nlie to each side.  Several other buildings line the trail before it\neventually leads to the edge of town.  To the east lie the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy thins the further west you go, until it eventually\ndisappears somewhere beyond the edge of town.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is still narrow and winding along this stretch of town, but\nit would appear that it widens a bit to the west.\n~\nE\nnorth south walls~\nThe buildings to each side of the trail are made of stone and allow\nno access from this side.  You note that it looks like the roof is\ncollapsing a little on the building to the north.\n~\nS\n#17214\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail passes between two stone structures as it continues north\nand south through town.  To your north lies a small crossroads, and to\nthe south the trail leads to the edge of town.  The hut to the east is\nin good shape, but a door prevents you from seeing inside.  To the west\nlies a stone shanty.  A curtain made of a thick hide is pulled tightly\nacross the doorway, and strange markings are scrawled in red along each\nside of the entrance.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17209\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17228\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here and takes on the appearance of an actual\nroad.  It looks as though this southern route gets used often--the dirt\nis well-packed and the path free from grass.\n~\nE\nmarkings red sign~\nThe markings are in a script you don't recognize, but they have a\ndecidely evil feeling about them.  You get the impression the paint used\nto make them was probably blood . . ..\n~\nE\ncurtain hide~\nThe curtain is simply the hide of a large animal, perhaps an oxen or\nwater buffalo.  It's secured from the top, and seems to be tied loosely\nat the bottom as well.  You should be able to open it, though.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy continues to thin to the south, and the forest retreats\nsomewhat behind the buildings.  It feels a lot less enclosed here.  The\nsun breaks through the trees to warm your face, and a gentle breeze blows\nfrom the south.\n~\nE\nhut~\nThe hut is a fine, stone building.  The exterior masonry is of high \nquality, and the roof is in good shape.  You note a small quantity of smoke\nwafting from the top of the chimney.\n~\nE\nshanty~\nThe shanty is built of loosely-fitted stone which appears to be more\n\"piled\" than \"fitted\".  You can see that the roof is old, but see no\nmajor holes.  It might be a good place to rest . . . if it isn't inhabited.\n~\nS\n#17215\nThe remains of a shack.~\nYou stand in the midst of a deteriorating shack.  It appears as if it was\nonce attached to the store to the south, perhaps as workspace.  Shelves\nline the stone walls, and an old anvil stands in the corner.  The wall to\nthe west is almost entirely collapsed, providing access to the trail\noutside.  To the south a door connects to the storefront.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17210\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nLittle remains of the roof but the rafters, which are now largely\nover-grown with vines.  With a little work, you could find a sheltered\ncorner to rest in.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nGrass has started to re-take the ground inside the hut.  There is still\na lot of bare ground, and it appears as though someone has been sleeping\nhere regularly.\n~\nE\nnorth east wall shelves shelf~\nSturdy shelves have been built directly into the stone walls, providing\na significant amount of storage space.  They have long been stripped of\nanything of value they might once have held, and are home to only dust\nnow.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door isn't too sturdy, and was clearly designed to be an interior\nfixture.  It appears to be in good working condition.\n~\nS\n#17216\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to an end soon at the wall of a stone hut.\nTo the south, it leads back to the center of town.  An empty doorway leads\nto the building to the west, and the wall of the building to the east has\ncollapsed, allowing you access.  The prospects look best to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17219\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17218\nE\ndown trail~\nIt doesn't look much like anyone ever stops here.  The trail is well\nworn running north and south, but weeds cover the ground to the east and\nwest.  You note a slight rise as the trail runs north.\n~\nE\nup~\nIt's amazing how fast the canopy thickens, and a dull grey has set in\nabout you.  You can see that the edge of the forst lies just beyond the\nbuildings in all directions, and you're surprised that is hasn't yet\nengulfed the whole town.\n~\nE\ncollapsed wall rubble~\nThe remains of the wall consist of large stones and mortar.  It won't\ntake much effort to climb over it.\n~\nS\n#17217\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17218\nA sturdy lean-to.~\nAll that remains of the once proud stone building that stood here is the\nfront wall.  The back wall is partially collapsed, and is now a waist-high\npile of rubble.  Some enterprising resident has constructed a roof between\nthe two walls by laying branches and reeds across a series of slim poles.\nIt's not pretty, but it's clean and looks rather comfortable.  The trail\nlies to the east.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nnorth south~\nThe walls of the neighboring building are covered with scattered vines\nand large patches of mold.  Not very attractive, but interesting . . ..\n~\nE\nbranches reed roof ceiling~\nMost of the original branches used to create the ceiling are long-dead\nand starting to rot.  The mass of vegetation from the forest beyond has\ngrown over much of it, though, and has nicely filled gaps as they formed.\n~\nE\nrubble back~\nThe pile of rubble, which consists of mostly large blocks of stone,\nstands about chest-high to a dwarf.  You'd probably have to crawl to\nactually get back to it . . . and it certainly doesn't look like it's\nworth the effort.\n~\nS\n#17219\nThe end of the dead-end street.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the wall of a large stone structure.  It's\nhard to tell for sure, but you'd guess that the building to the north is\npart of either the building to the east or west, or maybe both.  A sturdy\noak door covers the entrance of the shack to the east, and a strong, solid\niron door blocks the entrance to the hut to your west.  You can try your\nluck with either of those, or take the trail back to the south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17220\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17223\nE\nup~\nYou feel claustrophobic beneath the shadow of the overhanging trees\nalong this end of the street.  The owners of these homes obviously didn't\nchoose the location for the wealth of sunlight it offers.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail branches neatly to the left and right to the entrances of the\ntwo buildings.  It would seem that the residents use it a lot.\n~\nE\nnorth wall~\nIt's as good a wall as you've ever seen, but that's about it.  It looks\nlike someone might even be clearing the vines off of it on occasion.\n~\nE\nsturdy oak~\nThe door is made of heavy oak planks that bear the scars of many seasons.\nIt looks like it might bear the scars of a few swordfights as well.  It's\nno worse for the wear, though, and if it's locked you won't likely be\ngetting in without a key.\n~\nE\niron~\nThis huge door is constructed of solid iron, decorated with the occasional\nrivet to hold the hinges and latch.  Considering that it's attached to a\nwindowless stone building, you imagine it might once have been a bank or\nsome other important structure.\n~\nS\n#17220\nLiving room of a small house.~\nYou can see, now that you are inside, that this shack is actually more\nof a home.  Sparse furnishings litter the room, and a picture hangs on the\nwall above a small fireplace.  It's actually rather cozy.  The front\ndoor leads back to the trail, and another door leads north to an adjoining\nroom.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17221\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17219\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nThis house has a proper roof, with relatively new planking serving to\nkeep the elements at bay.  You venture a guess that someone probably\nlives here regularly.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is nothing but packed and swept dirt, but it has aged well\nand is very clean.  You're surprised, in fact, at how clean this whole\nplace is.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls of cut stone are clean and free of the mold you see growing\non other buildings in Shadowvale.  The more you look it over, the more\nyou like this place.\n~\nE\npicture~\nA drawing of an ugly giant in a crude wood frame hangs slightly askew\non the wall.  The inscription below reads \"Brutus\".  You wonder if it's\ntrue that a mother always thinks her child is cute . . . and, if so, just\nwhat Brutus' mother might look like . . ..\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nA small stone hearth set into the stone wall flickers brightly from the\nsmall fire within.  The rack inside suggests it might also be used for\ncooking as well.\n~\nS\n#17221\nBrutus' Guest Room.~\nThis room is nicely furnished with a bed, a small nightstand and a desk.\nAgain, it is spotless.  You realize now that this is probably the guest\nquarters for the larger house across the street to the west.  This looks\nlike it would be a nice place to rest, or the door to the south will\ntake you back to the living room.\n~\n0 D 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17220\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof in this room is the same as that in the adjoining room, and it\nseems to be connected to the building next door.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor here is well-kept as well.  A nice rug made from the skin of\nsome unknown animal lies alongside the bed, and there's not a dust ball\nto be found.\n~\nE\nbed~\nThe bed is nothing but a simple cot, but it looks plenty comfortable.\n~\nE\nrug skin~\nThe hide is a dark black in color, with thick, coarse hair.  If pressed\nfor an answer, you'd guess it was from a large bear.\n~\nE\nnight stand table~\nA small wooden table serves as a nightstand next to the bed.  An oil\nlamp, built into the center of the table, provides light for the room.\n~\nE\noil lamp~\nIt's a very simple lamp, but it's unique in that it's somehow fixed\nto the table.  It's much to awkward to be of use anywhere else, and\nserves its purpose here very well.\n~\nE\nwalls north west east~\nThe stone walls are almost polished from constant brushing and cleaning.\nYou're impressed at the effort put into the upkeep of this place,\nespecially when you consider the neighborhood.\n~\nS\n#17222\nInside Windrunner's Crystal Ball~\nYou find yourself suspended in the air amidst a kaleidoscope of swirling\nmist.  After a moment, you realize you have been transferred to the inside\nof Windrunner's Crystal Ball--where he puts imputent mortals he needs to\nattend to . . ..  You feel it would be best to wait and see what he wants.\n~\n0 CDKNT 9\nO windrunner~\nE\nmist swirling~\nThe mist swirls about you in a fantastic variety of colors.  You find the\neffect almost mesmerizing.\n~\nS\n#17223\nThe entrance to Brutus' house.~\nYou've entered a small room that serves as the foyer for a rather\nlarge hut.  Actually, it's almost a house.  Several pairs of boots\nare lined neatly along the wall, and above them a series of hooks\nwait patiently for someone to hang a coat on them.  Other than this, the\nroom is bare.  You hear voices coming from the adjoining room to the\nnorth, and an iron door leads east.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17224\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17219\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe sturdy roof is constructed of heavy planking across a timber frame.\nFrom the looks of it, this house was built to endure.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor, though generally free of debris, is a bit muddy.  You hope it\ndoesn't mess up your nice boots.\n~\nE\nwest south wall~\nThe walls are made of large stone blocks, cut to fit tightly.  They are\nworn smooth with age, but remain sturdy.  Spikes have been driven into\nthem in various places to serve as hangers.\n~\nE\nspike hanger~\nIt's your basic metal spike . . . and it's driven securely into the wall.\n~\nE\niron door~\nThe heavy iron door looks a lot less imposing from the inside than it\ndid from the trail.  In fact, you're guessing it isn't solid at all, and\nis probably just a facade to fool the local \"wildlife\".\n~\nE\nboots~\nThe boots are smelly and worn, and you decide quickly you don't really\nwant to examine them further . . . ..\n~\nS\n#17224\nBrutus' Waiting Room.~\nYou are in what appears to be a waiting room, or perhaps a common room,\nfor the larger house about you.  The room is bare except for three logs\nthat serve as chairs and a picture on the wall.  A torch affixed to the\nwall provides enough light for you to see back into the entryway to the\nsouth, but, strangely, you see no other doors.  You could have sworn that\nfrom the outside this place looked a lot bigger . . ..\n  Maybe you were wrong.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17225\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17223\nE\ntorch~\nIt's a simple torch, and it's secured to the wall . . . .\n~\nE\npicture~\nA charcoal sketch of a giant, who appears to be a thief, adorns the\neast wall.  It's not life-size, but it's at least four feet in height.\nThe word \"Brutus\" is written along the bottom of the sketch.  You're\ncertain that Brutus isn't the type of guy you'd want to invite to your\nMom's house for dinner . . ..\n~\nE\nwest north wall~\nThe walls, though clean, are unadorned.  Someone must have figured they\nwere working hard enough just holding up the ceiling.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling in this room takes on a slight A-Frame appearance.  You\njudge from its construction that this room was built sometime before,\nand in a much better fashion, than the entryway to the south.\n~\nS\n#17225\nBrutus' bedroom.~\nYou've entered Brutus' private sanctuary.  A small desk sits in the corner,\nand is covered in slips of paper and ledgers.  Apparently Brutus is the\nhead honcho in these parts.  A bedroll is unrolled in front of the hearth,\nwhere a small fire warms the room.  You can exit to the west through the\nsecret door, or another door will take you north.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17226\nD3\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17224\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16451 0 11185\nE\nsecret picture~\nTo the west a hole has been roughly hewn into the wall, and you can see\nthat it's been covered with a crudely fashion door to which the picture\nwas then mounted.  Very ingenious.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt is clean, except for small piles of wood\nscraps around the hearth.  The bedroll occupies a corner of the room.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is constructed of spaced planks with wood shingles laid over\nthem.  It would seem that this isn't the orginal roof, and that perhaps\nBrutus had some work done recently.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls are made of stone and mortar.  They're discolored with age,\nbut basically in good shape.\n~\nE\nbedroll~\nThe bedroll is nothing but an old, ratty blanket, and you imagine it's\nprobably the source fo the horrible smell in the room.\n~\nE\nhearth fire~\nA small hearth is set into the wall, and a fire has recently been started.\nIt looks like Brutus was settling in for the evening.\n~\nE\nslips paper ledger~\nSeveral slips marked \"I.O.U.\" lay scattered about a large ledger.  In it\nBrutus seems to be tracking his income.  It looks like he's not only\ntrafficking in stolen merchandise, but collecting \"taxes\" from the local\nresidents as well.  From what you know about numbers, Brutus appears to\nbe doing very nicely for himself.\n~\nE\ndesk~\nIt's a small, simple desk.  It's made of wood, with a stone top.  There\nare holes in the front where drawers used to be, but Brutus seems to have\nfound little use for them.\n~\nS\n#17226\nBrutus' closet.~\nThis small closet is where Brutus probably keeps his inventory.

The room has been dug beneath\nthe closet, and is rather crude.

Little bits\nhave caved in here and there, and in several spots it looks like sharp\nweapons, maybe spears, were stuck into the walls for storage.  You wonder\nhow many good rains it will take until this whole end of the house sinks\ninto the ground.\n~\nE\nup secret~\nYou can see from below that the secret door is made from thick planks,\nand is laid across the top of the hole.  Brutus made it thick enough to\nseem real when he closed it and spread the dirt over it--but he just\nain't as smart as you, is he?\n~\nS\n#17228\nThe Cleric's Shanty.~\nThe small altar in the corner suggests that this shack is the home of\nthe local priest.

It would also seem\nthat they have tracked all sorts of dirt and other gross things in with\nthem.  You can see why the priest made the cot.\n~\nE\ncot bed~\nA simple cot, consisting of a board laid across to pieces of firewood,\nsits in the corner of the shack.  It looks really uncomfortable, but\nyou could see the advantages of it over, say, sleeping on the floor.\n~\nE\ndoor curtain hide~\nThe door to the shack consists of a simple hide nail to the upper\ncorners.  Apparently the priest trusts his clientele a little more\nthat you would.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is made of randomly over-laid planks.  The gaps\nare plugged with rags and other assorted materials, and the effort looks\nto be mildly successful.\n~\nE\nnorth west south walls~\nThe walls of the shack are simply planks, coated with a thin film of\nwhat looks like mud.  If it was an attempt at plaster, it was a very bad\none.  They do serve to keep the elements at bay, however . . ..\n~\nS\n#17229\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail continues north and south through Shadowvale.  To the north\nyou see a crossroads and what appears to be a fountain.  To the south,\nthe trail becomes a road out of town.

A flimsy door has\nbeen set into the entrance, and a small window sits off to one side of\nthe door.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the trees above in various places, dispelling\nsome of the eerie shadows from the trees above.  This place is still\ndefinitely on the wierd side of creepy, though.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is covered in dirt.  As you wipe a spot clean, you note that\nthe curtains are drawn and you can't see in anyway.\n~\nE\ndoor flimsy~\nThe door most likely keeps out nothing but the rain.  Still, it'd be\neasier to open it than to kick it in . . ..\n~\nS\n#17230\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more than planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.

They are spotted with pieces of cloth, hide and anything\nelse that was available to keep out the rain.\n~\nE\nnorth east south walls~\nThe walls, such as they are, are a conglomeration of materials put\ntogether as availability and need dictated.  \"Mess\" is the first word\nthat comes to mind.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17231\nThe common shack.~\nThis well-maintained shack seems to serve as a common home to a variety\nof Shadowdale's residents.  Several bedrolls cover the floor, and gear\nof all kinds sits about the room.  You get the feeling, however, that the\nresidents wouldn't be ideal roommates . . ..

You could probably put your fist through them if\nyou had to, but it would be easier just to open them . . .\n~\nE\nnorth south wall~\nThe walls of the shack are simple, unadorned planks, many of which seem\nto have come from other buildings . . ..\n~\nE\ngear~\nA variety of gear in states of general mis-use lie about the room.  While\nsome of it may once have been useful, it's all junk now.\n~\nE\nbed bedrolls~\nSeveral piles of hides lie scattered about the room serving as beds.\nThey look as if they are used regularly.\n~\nS\n#17232\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail winds between two more buildings before it leads south out of\ntown.  As it leaves town, the trail leads slowly down into a wide valley.\nThe trees continue to thin in that direction, and you can't be sure, but\nyou think you see the glint of sunlight reflecting off water far down in\nthe valley.  The trail leads north back into town.

The repairs look almost as sturdy as the\nremaining foundation, if not moreso.  It's clearly an old building, but\nsomeone is making an effort to keep it well-maintained.\n  A solid oak door is set into the doorway, blocking your view inside.\n~\nE\nvine patch mortar branch~\nSomeone seems to have patched holes in the foundation of the hut with\na mixture of muddy mortar and branches.  Vines have taken root, providing\nan overlying web of flora.  The patches give the hut a very \"earthy\"\nappearance, almost like a large, moss-covered rock with a nice patch\nof sod growing on top.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is well-trodden here, and it appears many pairs of boots have\nmade the journey south.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun struggles to break through the canopy here, and it appears to\nbe having much more success to the south.  You see birds among the boughs\nof the oaks again, and the chatter of squirrels filters down from far\nabove.\n~\nE\ndoor oak plank~\nThe door to this hut has been cut from a single width of hard oak\nplanking.  It looks very secure, which is good, but rare, in this\nneighborhood.  If it's locked, it would probably be easier to cut a\nhole in the wall than to break it down.\n~\nS\n#17233\nA well-built hut.~\nYou have entered a very comfortable shack.  Though the only furniture\nis a bed in one corner, the shack appears to have been recently cleaned.\nThe walls are solid, and the roof is strong enough to keep out the rain.\nWhat a wonderful place to hide away and rest.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17232\nE\noak plank~\nThe door looks as solid from the inside as it did from outside.

Someone did a very nice job of building it.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor of the hut is basically hard-packed dirt.  However, it's\npacked very well, and is almost as solid as stone.\n~\nE\nwalls east north south~\nThe walls of the hut consist of a waist-high stone foundation and smooth\nplanks above that.  They are entirely bare, and could use some decoration.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe door looks just as good inside, and is in very good shape.  If you\nwere to close it, it would probably keep unwanted characters out.\n~\nS\n#17234\nThe remains of a burned building.~\nYou stand amidst the charred ruins of what once might have been a very\nnice shack.  There certainly was a lot of wood in it, as the ashes are\nknee deep and charcoal beams still attempt to hold a roof that no longer\nexists.  You might find something if you rummage, but the place looks\nlike it's been well-scavanged.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\nvegetation forest vines~\nBranches from the forest beyond have grown through the remaining wall\nsupports, protruding into the room.  Large vines have used the branches\nto bridge their way in as well, and are slowly overtaking the area.  You\nare amazed at the resilience of the forest behind the building, and can't\neven imagine how horrible it would be to get stuck in it.\n~\nE\nashes ruins~\nDeep piles of gray ashes, matted into flat mounds by wind and rain,\nprovide an eerie backdrop for the grim black beams which rise like the\ntrees on some lost desert plain.  This place is creepy, even by local\nstandards.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest has already begun to reclaim the back wall of the house.  The\nvines have made themselves at home on the remaining wall supports, and\nhave created an impassable wall of vegetation.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nA short stone foundation survived on the southern side of the lot, \ndefiantly supporting the last remains of the only thing that can be clearly\nidentified as a wall.  Through the remains you can see that the forest\nappears to thin to the south, and you see the trail leading south into\nthe woods just in front of the building.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nThe owners of the building to the north seem to have salvaged a lot of\nthe useful materials from this site, and used them to re-build their\nsouthern wall.  They didn't do a very good job, though, and none of the\npieces fit together.  Cracks and holes appear all over.\n~\nE\nhole crack~\nYou can make out faint shapes inside the shack.  It's too dark to be\nsure, but judging from the whispering and sounds of shuffling, it sounds\nlike the residents might be home . . . and there's more than one person\nat home.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe gray ashes are a little damp, and are making a mess of your boots.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is much thinner here than at the northern edges of town, and\nthe occasional ray of sun sneaks through.  It appears that the trees\ncontinue to thin to the south.\n~\nS\n#17235\nA trail leading south out of town.~\nYou stand on the southern edge of the small village of Shadowvale.  The\ntown, which spreads out to your north, has a dark and menacing feel about\nit--even here you feel many eyes watching you.  The road continues north\ninto town, or south to the thinner forest and, eventually, foreign realms.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\ndown trail road~\nThe road is clear and well-marked as it leaves town to the south.  To\nthe north, it appears to lead into the heart of the village.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe thin forest to the west holds little of interest for you, though you\ndo see the remains of a burned-out building to the west of your trail--\nright on the edge of the approaching village.\n~\nE\neast~\nYou see a shack sitting along the east side of the road just north of here,\nmarking the entrance to a village.  The forest is just thin enough that\nyou could leave the trail without getting too horribly lost, but you see\nnothing of interest that would justify the effort.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun beams down upon you brightly as you look up to see squirrels\nplaying among the trees.

An empty lot lies to your north, and you can see\na small grove of pine trees lying just beyond.  To your south are the\nremains of an old shack.

It might still\nprovide shelter . . . if you can wedge yourself into a dry corner.  The\ndoorway is empty, the door long-ago stolen for some other housing project.\n~\nS\n#17237\nA campsite in an empty lot.~\nThis vacant lot has been used as a campsite so many times that it has\ntaken on a permanent appearance.  The remains of several fires are\nscattered about the site, and a pine grove that begins on the north\nend of the lot provides nice cover for sleeping.  You can go into the\ngrove to your north, or to the trail through town to the south.

You can make out a clearing to the north in the pine\ngrove, and taller weeds along the walls on each side of the lot provide\nnice protection from the wind.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest has thinned to only scattered trees, and the sun beams down\nupon the lot.  Shade can be gained under the pines to the north, and you\ncan see the forest rising above the far side of the grove.\n~\nE\neast west wall~\nA barrier of weeds and shrubs rings the lot along the edges of the\nneighboring buildings.  The walls appear to be solid and offer no access\nto the inside of either structure.\n~\nE\ncampfire fire~\nSeveral blackened circles surrounded with stones are scattered about\nthe lot.  Half-burned logs, apparently from the pine forest, lie rotting\naround the edges of each site.\n~\nS\n#17238\nA small pine grove.~\nYou have wandered into a small pine grove tucked away behind the homes\nin this area.  The underbrush has been tamed in this clearing, and the\nfresh scent of the small pines is quite refreshing.  The grove continues\nto your north and west.  To your east lies the back wall of a shack, and\nto the south a campsite.  It appears that the pine needles which litter\nthe ground would make a wonderful place to sleep.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17239\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17237\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17241\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees at the front of the grove look young and healthy, as if \nperhaps they are thinned regularly, or used for firewood.  They provide\nnice shelter for the grove, though they aren't much for climbing.\n~\nE\nwall shack east~\nThe wall of the shack is overgrown with flowery vines.  There do not\nappear to be any windows or other distinguishing features.\n~\nE\nflowery vines~\nThe vines appear to be from the morning glory family.  They cover the\nwall in thick patterns, sprouting patches of beautiful purple teacup\nshaped flowers here and there.  Insects and small birds play contentedly\nin the cover they provide.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe bed of pine needles which covers the ground is quite thick.  There\nare patches here and there where piles of needles have been gathered, most\nlikely for use in building fire.  The softness of the ground is a welcome\ntreat for your aching feet.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe boughs of the pines dance lightly in the wind overhead.  Birds and\nsquirrels ramble aimlessly among the branches searching for food.\n~\nS\n#17239\nA small pine grove.~\nThe serenity of the pine grove calms your anxieties as you venture\ndeeper within.  The heavy undergrowth of the forest once again rises to\nchoke out the pines and block passage to the north, and the back of\na house lies to your east.  The grove continues west and south . . . \nsuddenly, a loud cry captures your attention, and it appears to be coming\nfrom the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nE\npine tree~\nYou're amazed that these little trees do so well in the midst of the\ndark forest.  They can't be over 20 feet tall, and it's almost as if\nmagic protects them from the darkness around them.\n~\nE\nforest vines undergrowth~\nThe forest rises quickly above the grove, the undergrowth rising at its\nfeet to form a wall of vegetation that is clearly impassable.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe inside of the house is dimly lit, but you can clearly make out the\nshapes of two large \"men\" sitting around a table.  You make a mental note\nof the house's location so as not to accidentally wander in on them.\n~\nE\neast house shack~\nThe house to the east appears to be constructed of stone, and is in\nvery good shape.  Vines cover the back wall, but you can make out a window\nhidden behind a patch of flowers.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe soft needles here are not as nice as the ones at the entrance to\nthe grove . . . mushrooms, vines and other offshoots frmo the forest\nfight for a foothold.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy of the neighboring forest towers above the edge of the grove,\nreminding you again of the ominous nature of the entire village.  Once\nagain, life appears almost non-existent overhead . . . though you do feel\nthe odd sensation of being watched . . ..\n~\nS\n#17240\nA small pine grove.~\nThere is a small clearing in the pine forest, and a lone pine tree \nstands in the northwest corner of the grove.  As you peer intently\nup into the branches, you see a large owl's nest perched just out of\nreach.

It looks pretty spooky anyway . . ..\n~\nE\ntree pine~\nThe pine tree stands alone in the corner of the clearing, as if holding\noff the forest by itself.  It provides a perfect perch for the owl to\nsurvey the grove, and plenty of room to swoop quickly down upon its\nunsuspecting dinner guests.\n~\nE\nnest~\nThe owl's nest looks to be about a yard in width, and is constructed\nof twigs and leaves wedged into a deep hole in the tree.  It sits just\nout of your reach . . . and the tree offers no branches for you to climb.\n~\nE\nskeleton~\nThe skeleton appears to be that of a rat, or perhaps a small cat.  It\nis about the right size for an owl's dinner.  It's best left alone.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe ground is relatively clear here--a perfect area for an owl's\nhunting grounds.  A small skeleton lies half-covered in pine needles,\nbut you see no other signs that anyone has been here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest hangs precariously above the pine grove, drowning out most\nof the light.  Besides the owl's nest, there are few signs of life here.\n~\nS\n#17241\nA small pine grove.~\nThis corner of the pine grove is very pleasant, and is by far the\nbrightest.  The forest closes in to block passage to the west, and adds\nan ominous gloom to an otherwise nice place.  The wall of a stone building\nlies to your south, and the pine grove runs to the east and north.  You\nhear a strange, hair-tingling shriek in the latter direction.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nE\ndown needles~\nThere are signs that others have been here before you.  The needles\nshow places where several others have rested, at least one of whom was\nbleeding . . . the trail of blood leads off to the north.\n~\nE\nstone wall house building~\nThe back of the house is simply a rock wall, offering no windows or\ndoors for passage.\n~\nE\nwest forest undergrowth~\nThough it appears that the forest thins a bit to the west, there's no\nway you're going to get there from here to find out.  It's almost as if\nsomeone has been encouraging the forest to form a wall . . . it's hard\nto believe it could be so consistently unpassable on it's own.\n~\nE\nbirds~\nThe birds appear to be only sparrows, and they're far out of your\nreach.  There's probably a better meal to be had somewhere else.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou spot several birds fluttering around amongst the pines, and hear\nthe distinct sounds of squirrels playing out of sight.\n~\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees provide a nice amount of cover here, and it would be a\nwonderful place to kick back and ponder the mysteries of life . . ..\n~\nS\n#17242\nThe remains of a shack.~\nThis shack has pretty much reached the end of its useful life.  The\nroof has collapsed in upon the interior, and most anything of use was\nlong ago stripped and salvaged.  You can climb across the rubble, where\na small clearing seems to sit in back of the building to the south, or\nexit to the path through town to the north.  To the east lies the exterior\nwall of a sturdy building, and to the west you see a hide-covered hut,\nbut no way to enter it.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nE\neast building wall~\nThe bare face of a stone wall forms the back of the building to the east.\nThere would appear to be no access from this side.\n~\nE\nwest hide hut~\nTo the west you can just make out what looks like an igloo made of\nanimal skins tucked within the trees.  However, you can't tell much more\nthan that from this vantage point.\n~\nE\nrubble~\nThe rubble would appear to be the remains of a rock wall which fell\nvictim to the elements some time ago.  It is now only a waist-high pile\nof rocks and boards.  You should be able to climb over it easily to get\nto the clearing beyond.\n~\nE\ndown~\nGrass and a variety of weeds have started to re-establish themselves now\nthat the shack has collapsed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees have thinned overhead, but the sun isn't at the proper angle\nto reach this particular lot.  Too bad, the grass could use some help.\n~\nS\n#17243\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYour attention is immediately drawn to the hut to the south, which appears\nto be constructed of animal hides and stands out awkwardly from the forest.\nTo your north is the stone wall of an old hut, the entrance of which lies\nfurther to the west.  The edge of town lies to your west, and the trail\neast will take you into the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17247\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\nhut hide~\nFrom the trail, it looks as though the hut is made of a large segment\nof leather pulled taught over some sort of from.  Further inspection\nmight provide more insights.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou are clearly near the western edge of the forest, as the trees become\nmuch thicker, and ominously darker, the further east you look.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-packed and dry.  It looks like many pairs of\nfeet, and in some cases multiple pairs, have used the trail recently.\n~\nE\nwall stone~\nExcept for a few small vines and some patches of fungus, the stone wall\nis bare.  You can tell from the outside that the door to this building is\nthe one just west of here.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nYou'll have to go a little farther west down the trail to see the door\nproperly.\n~\nS\n#17244\nA storage closet.~\nThe closet is very plain.  Several nails have been pounded into the\nwalls to serve as hooks, and the floor is scratched from the occasional\ntrunk that has been dragged in and out.

It would certainly be among the cleaner places you've\nrested today . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of the hut appears to be made of planks, sealed here and there\nwith patches of sod.  It's not much, but it would likely keep you dry\nin the rain.\n~\nE\neast north south walls~\nThe walls are bare, but sturdy.\n~\nE\ndoor west~\nThe door separates the closet from the main room of the shack.  When\nclosed, it provides decent privacy.\n~\nS\n#17245\nThe Warrior's Shack.~\nYou have entered a well-kept shack that appears to belong to a warrior\nwho has taken up long-term residence in Shadowvale.  Though plain and\nunfurnished, the stone walls provide protection from the elements and,\nwell, at least the door works.  The trail through town lies to the\nsouth, and a door is set into the eastern wall.\n~\n0 D 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17244\nD2\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17246\nE\nnorth west walls~\nThe stone walls are well-constructed, and on the inside, at least, are\nin good shape.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of this shack actually has shingles, though light shows \nthrough in the corners of the room.  It's better than sleeping in the rain.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in oak planking.  It's worn, but not deteriorating.\nIt's certainly good enough to keep most of the bugs out of your bedroll.\n~\nE\ndoor east~\nThe door to the east isn't as solid as the exterior door, and appears\nto lead to a storage room or closet.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door to the outside is quite sturdy, and will definitely keep out\nwandering fidos and other undesirables.\n~\nS\n#17246\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYou stand at the western-most edge of a small village tucked within\nthe forest.  The town spreads out to the east, hidden beneath the quickly\ndarkening forest.  An air of gloom hangs over the grove, and you see\nlittle movement in the streets.  To your north lies an entrance to\na sturdy stone hut, but a wooden door blocks any view inside.  To your\nsouth is a dilapitated shack--the door is closed, but you can't imagine\nwhy anyone would bother.  The trail leaves town to your west, and leads\ninto the center of town (as well as the deeper forest) to your east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17245\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17248\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17249\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens as it leaves town to the west.  To the east, it becomes\nnarrower as it winds between the scattered buildings and trees.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is open and airy above you, and squirrels frolic among the\nboughs.  You can see that the trees slowly fade to the west, while to the\neast the canopy thickens and eventually fades into darkness.\n~\nE\nsouth shack~\nThe dilapitated shack to the south appears ready to collapse in on\nitself.  The walls are old and rotted, and large chunks of the roof\nare missing.  The well-worn path to the door suggests that someone\nis still using it regularly, despite its condition.\n~\nE\nwooden door~\nIt's a wooden door--your time would be better spent trying to open it.\n~\nE\nnorth stone hut~\nThe sturdy hut is built from cut limestone and looks to be kept up\nregularly.  You judge from the building pattern that it probably also\nextends to the east, but you see no entrance in that direction.  The\nwooden door is closed, but looks like it probably works.\n~\nS\n#17247\nA hut covered in animal hides.~\nHides have been stretched across a frame of bent branches to form a\ndomed hut among the trees.  The floor is clean and dry, and someone\nhas recently been building fires in the center of the room.  A shaft\nof sunlight pierces the hole in the roof which serves as a chimney,\nand casts a dim light about the room.  The doorway to the north leads\nback to the trail.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nstraw pile~\nIt would seem the current occupant is using the pile of straw as a bed.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt has been carefully maintained.  It is smooth\nand, except for a pile of straw in the corner, free of debris.\n~\nE\nhole up~\nYou can just make out the boughs of the trees as the wind blows them\nback and forth above the hut.  The hole is about a dagger's length\nacross--just enough to draw the smoke out, and not enough to let the\nrain in.\n~\nE\nbranches~\nThe branches appear to be taken from willow trees.  About a dozen of\nthem rise around the edge of the cirular shelter, and are tied with\ntwine where they meet at the top.\n~\nE\nhide walls skins~\nThe hides appear to be from a wide variety of animals.  Large skins,\nmost likely from wolves and bears, form the majority of the structure,\nand smaller skins have been used to fill the gaps.  Overall, the work\nis excellent.\n~\nS\n#17248\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17249\nThe trail leading out of Shadowvale.~\nThe trail leads east into a small village hidden within the edge of\nthe forest.  To the west the forest thins and eventually fades altogether.\nSquirrels and other wildlife play in the light cover near the trail, and\nyou can hear the chatter of birds in the surrounding canopy.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail looks well-travelled to the east toward town, but fades here\nand can't be seen to the west.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest thins to the west, but you can't make out the lands beyond.\nThe trail ends here, however, so there can't be too much out there . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the canopy in many places, leaving misty trails\nas it seeks out the ground below.  You notice the eerie contrast with\nthe forest to the east, which quickly becomes dark and menacing.\n~\nE\nnorth south forest~\nThe forest around you consists of random trees scattered among a low\ncovering of bushes and vines.  It has a rather cheerful feel about it,\nand you note a wide range of scents in the air.\n~\nS\n#17250\nA small clearing in the woods.~\nA small clearing has been created just behind the shacks along this\nrow.  Piles of garbage sit rotting along the edge of the forest, which\ncloses quickly in against the southern and western edges of the lot.\nThere are signs of a trail entering the underbrush to the west, but it\nis difficult to make out where it might go.  The back door of a shack\nlies to your east, and the remains of a fallen building lie north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD1\nExit ~\nback door east~\n16387 0 17231\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nE\ndown~\nThe clearing is covered in a soft, green turf.  If it weren't for the\nstink of rotting garbage, it'd be a nice place to rest for awhile.\n~\nE\nup~\nNo trees grow in the lot, and the refreshing glow of sunlight enhances\nthe area.  You can tell from the canopy though that this might be the only\nsunny spot for some distance in any direction.\n~\nE\ntrail west~\nThere appears to be a path leading into the forest at the western edge\nof the clearing, but the undergrowth is so heavy it is hard to be sure.\n~\nE\npile garbage~\nIt looks as if someone has been tossing the remains of meals, and perhaps\nworse, along the edges of this lot.  Even if there was something of value\nburied deep in there, you doubt it's worth enough to dig around and find\nit.\n~\nE\nback door east~\nThe door is simply a variety of random boards and planks tied together\nwith string and vines.  Nice effort, but certainly better at keeping\nout the wind than hearty adventurers like yourself.\n~\nS\n#17251\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail plunges into the forest, and the vegetation immediately\npresses in against you.  It appears that the trail continues south, and\nreturns east to the clearing.\n~\n0 A 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17252\nE\ndown trail~\nThe ground is covered in vegetation, and vines reach out to snag your\nfeet and armor.  The trail is faint, but after a few seconds you can\nsee that it clearly goes south, if anywhere . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest above is so thick that light can hardly penetrate.  The\nlower branches are covered in vines, and you can't see any further into\nthe forest in this direction than in any other.\n~\nE\nwest north forest underbrush~\nThe undergrowth is thick in this part of the forest.  You think the\nbacks of the buildings along the main trail should be to your north, but\nit is impossible to see more than several feet into the vegetation.\nThe trail is the only possible means of passage through this area.\n~\nS\n#17252\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the forest edge.  Vegetation presses in\nfrom the south, east and west preventing further passage.  A strange bush\nprotruding from the forest edge to the west captures your attention.\n~\n0 A 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17253\nE\ndown~\nThick sod, covered in leaves and decaying branches, covers the forest\nfloor.  You feel you should watch carefully where you are walking so\nas not to entangle yourself in the vines.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees grow low over the path, and the vines growing from the\nbranches hang just out of reach.  A wave of claustrophobia overcomes\nyou, and you feel the urge to turn and run.\n~\nE\nsouth east forest underbrush~\nThe underbrush almost reaches out from the forest to draw you in.  You\nhear the cries of a wide variety of wildlife from beyond the edge of the\ntrees, but you can't imagine what would live in such darkness.  You can't,\nthat's for sure . . . you might as well turn around and head back.\n~\nE\nhandle~\nThe handle is too deep in the bush to see.  Perhaps if you opened\nthe bush . . . \n~\nE\nmetal inside~\nThere appears to be a fence inside the bush.  As you investigate further,\nyou notice that the bush gives slightly under your weight.  You feel what\ncould be a handle of some sort . . .\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nAt first glance, the bush appears to be dying.  The leaves have all\ndried out, and the whole thing seems to almost sway and flap in the wind\n . . . almost as if it were hanging.  You see the faint glint of sunlight\nstriking metal deep inside.\n~\nS\n#17253\nThe hidden hut.~\nYou've gained entrance to a hut hidden within the underbrush at the\nedge of the forest.  It is constructed primarily of sod, and has the feel\nof an igloo--but it obviously wasn't built for comfort.  It is clearly\na temporary hideout of some sort, and amenities aren't apparently a\npriority to the owner.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17252\nE\ndown floor~\nSomeone has made an effort to at least pack the dirt on the ground into\nsomething resembling a floor.  Grass still grows in places, but it isn't\ndoing well in the absence of sunlight.\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nFrom the inside, you can see that someone has simply uprooted an\nentire bush and built a wire door frame through the middle.  The bush\nthen hangs from the frame, and from the outside, appears to still be\nhappily anchored in the soil.  You admire the genius that came up with\nthis idea.\n~\nE\n~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\nup branches vines~\nThe branches and vines that form the ceiling provide an interesting\nmaze at which to stare while you lie on your back awaiting sleep.\n~\nE\nwalls west south north sod~\nThe sod was cut from the ground and stacked into piles about 8 feet in\nheight.  A series of branches were added across the top of the room, and\nvines were allowed to grow across them as a \"roof\".  Not exactly the\nbuilding materials you'd choose for a honeymoon suite, but they serve\ntheir current purpose well . . . finding and getting into this hut is\ncertainly a challenge.\n~\nS\n#17254\nA path in the forest.~\nThe forest deepens to the west, and appears nearly impassable.  The trail\ncontinues in that direction though, as well as returning to the east.  The\nvegetation presses in from the north and south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17200\nS\n#17255\nA path through the forest.~\nThe path leads west from here, directly into the heart of the darkest\npart of the forest.  You notice an odd \"stillness\" about the trail in\nthat direction.  The forest pushes in from the south and east, preventing\npassage in those directions altogether.  To the north, the forest thins\nconsiderably.\n~\n0 0 3\nH 200 M 200\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17256\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17254\nE\nsouth east forest vegetation~\nYou note that the trees are becoming larger and older as you move to\nthe west.  Thick underbrush and massive vines block passage to the south\nand east, forcing the trail to turn to the west and north.\n~\nE\nup~\nBeams of sunlight burst through the canopy above, giving the forest about\nyou an eerie glow.  You can see that as you move west, the light disappears\ncompletely, and to the east the forest appears to be thinner.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail turns north and west here, forced to change course by the\nthickening underbrush.\n~\nS\n#17256\nThe path into the forest.~\nThe forest rises in a thick wall to the west.  Large vines and thick\nunderbrush provide an eerie backdrop to the deepeing darkness in that\ndirection.  The trail continues south, plunging into the edge of the\ndeeper woods, and to the east leads to a crossroads.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 3510\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nE\nnorth west vines underbrush forest~\nWhile the forest to the east is relatively clear, the forest to the\nwest is a mass of vegetation.  Thick, dark tree trunks rise far above you\nand squeak with a menacing tone as they sway in wind.  Large vines and\nbrambles grow between them, creating an impenetrable mass.  You can't\nimagine what kind of creatures would make their homes here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest seems to lean over you from the west, almost as it if plans\nto engulf you as a lunchtime snack.  The sun still finds the occasional\nhole to poke through here, but you can see it's having much better luck\nto the east.  Perhaps you would too . . ..\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail thins as it enters the forest to the south, but the hard-\npacked dirt suggests that it does, in fact, get travelled.

The \"street\" looks empty to the west, and a large\nhedge blocks the path to the east.  To the south a lean-to has been\nconstructed among the trees, and a shack lies to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor skimpy~\n16387 0 17204\nD1\nExit ~\nhedge door east secret~\n16387 0 17201\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17203\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nE\neast~\nA large hedge cuts across the path, marking the edge of a denser section\nof forest.  The path disappears into the hedge.  Closer examination\nmight reveal a way to get through.\n~\nE\ndown~\nYou had better tie that bootlace before going on . . . .\n~\nE\nhedge~\nThe hedge seems to mark the barrier between the grove and the deeper\nforest beyond.  The trail leads right into the hedge, and upon closer\ninspection you note a small opening.  If you could open the hedge just\na little farther, you could squeeze through to the other side.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy overhead thins as it nears the center of town.  It's almost\nas if this were a hidden oasis tucked deep within the forest.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is constructed from old and weather-worn planks, most of which\nwere probably stolen from other structures.  A skimpy door covers the\nentrance.\n~\nE\nlean-to~\nTo the south, a lean-to has been constructed among the trees.  It appears\nto be made of nothing but branches, but it blends into the surrounding\nvegetation so well it is difficult to tell from here.\n~\nS\n#17203\nA lean-to in the woods.~\nThe lean-to has been constructed from bundles of branches lashed to a\ncross-support, which in turn has been secured to two trees.  The \"roof\"\nslopes down toward the southeast corner and is open to the north, where\na small footpath leads back to the trail.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17202\nE\neast west walls vegetation~\nThe lean-to has no walls as such, though a number of vines have draped \nover the roof to provide some protection from the wind.\n~\nE\nroof up~\nThe \"roof\" is nothing but dead branches tied into bundles with vines and\npiled deep enough across the supporting branch to provide shelter from the\nelements.  Not much, but you can tell it's probably effective.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the lean-to is nothing but soft grass.  There is a large\nindentation toward the back--obviously where someone has been sleeping on\na regular basis of late.\n~\nS\n#17204\nA large shack.~\nThe shack is constructed of weathered planks, obviously salvaged from\nother buildings.  Vines and branches from the forest outside poke through\nthe occasional gaps in the walls, but the shack seems to be holding up\nwell.  The door to the south leads back to the trail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor skimpy~\n16387 0 17202\nE\nvines branches wall north east west~\nThe weathered planks appear to be randomly nailed together.  What gaps\nwere left have long ago been covered by the vegetation of the dense forest\noutside.  Other than some interesting construction work, there is little\nelse of interest on the walls.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe dirt floor is clean, but doesn't look very comfortable.  It would\nprovide a dry place to rest, though.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling has been constructed of the same planks as the walls.  \nThough originally full of gaps and holes, the vegetation overgrowing the\nshack has made the roof neatly watertight.\n~\nE\nskimpy door~\nThe door consists of several thin boards nailed to some branches for\nsupport.  It appears to work like any other door . . ..\n~\nS\n#17205\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail continues toward the heart of the village.  A poorly-built\nshack lies to the north, while a more durable stone hut lies to the south.\nThe buildings continue along the trail ahead to what looks like a\ncrossroads or village square, and the trail leads back east to the dense\nforest.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17206\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17202\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door is made of hardwood planks and sturdy supports.  It would be\na tough one to break down . . . you might want to try just opening it.\n~\nE\nstone hut~\nThe hut to the south is constructed of solid stone walls with a proper,\nand well-maintained, thatch roof.  A solid wood door sits in the wall\ndirectly to your south, and the hut seems to continue to the west, where\nyou spot a window.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail continues through the trees, which are now thinning enough\nfor you to see that it leads to the west through town, and perhaps even\nwidens a little as it goes.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is a poor effort at shelter, and seems to consist of nothing\nmore than boards and branches tied to trees.  A small opening at the front\nserves as a door.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nYou'd have to go farther to the west to look into the window.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy continues to thin as you approach the center of town, and you\ncan tell that it eventually fades to the west.  You see bright shafts of\nsunlight breaking through the canopy in that direction, and the town\nlooks a lot less gloomy.\n~\nS\n#17206\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more that planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.  You might want to use the door to the south to get back on the\ntrail and out of harm's way.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nE\nwalls north east west planks~\nThe planks used to \"make\" the walls vary in size.  They also vary in\ncolor, shape and the means by which they are held together.  It's quite\nthe menagerie of construction methods.  You get the impression that a\nlot of the credit for the fact that the structure is still standing\nshould go to the vines outside, whose roots wrap tightly around anything\nexposed to the outside.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17207\nA large stone hut.~\nThe interior of the hut is dark and damp.  The stone walls are bare on the\ninside, and except for several mats on the floor there is nothing in the\nroom.  You hear voices to the west, and can see from the flickering light\naround the edges of the curtain hanging in the doorway that a fire is\nburning there.  The smell of cooking meat tempts you, but you can also\ngo through the door to the north and get on the main trail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17209\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door to the outside is made of sturdy hardwood planks.  It provides\ngood security, and, unlike most of the doors in this town, seems to have\nactually been made for the doorway it inhabits.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn of clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\ndown floor mat~\nSeveral worn reed mats lie about the floor, apparently serving as beds\nfor the current residents of the hut.\n~\nE\nroof ceiling thatch~\nLarge bundles of reeds, tied with vines, have been piled across a\ncarefully planned set of cross-supports.  This roof surely has no\nproblems with leaks.\n~\nE\nwalls south east stone~\nThe walls are constructed of square limestone blocks, obviously cut\ncarefully to fit.  You're surprised at the effort that went into them,\nand wonder if this building wasn't meant to be something more.\n~\nS\n#17208\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail approaches a small crossroads to the west, and what looks like\nit might be a fountain sits in the midst of the path in that direction.\nTo the east, the trail continues to the forest at the edge of town.  To the\nnorth is a stone building which appears to be a store of some sort, and\nto the south lies a stone hut.  The entrance to the hut is to the east,\nthough the window in front of you seems as if it might allow you to see\ninside.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17210\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nE\nletter sign~\nThe letters are difficult to make out, but with some effort, you can see\nthat the sign reads:  Blacksmith.\n~\nE\nbuilding store~\nThe building to the north looks to be a storefront, though it is in\ngreat disrepair.  The door covering the entrance is old, but appears as\nif it might still work.  As you get closer, you notice the presence of\nfaint lettering painted above the door.\n~\nE\nsouth hut~\nThe walls of the hut are in good shape, and the thick thatch roof\nsuggests some work has been done to keep this building up.  There is a door\ndown the trail to the east which seems to lead inside, and a window set\ninto the wall in front of you.  You think you see the flicker of flames\nthrough the window, but you can't be sure.\n~\nE\ndoor old~\nThe door is worn and weathered, and the hinges a bit rusty, but it\nseems likely you could still open it.\n~\nE\nup trees~\nThe sun fights its way through the boughs above and, when the branches\nget blown just the right way in the wind, the occasional warm ray of light\nreaches your face.  The canopy shows more signs of life as you move farther\nfrom the dense forests to the east.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here, and straightens out as the trees thin.  \nThe ground is a bit wet, which you attribute to the leaky fountain to the\nwest.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is very dirty, but you can make out a dimly-lit room inside\nthe hut.  There seems to be a door on the west side of the room, and\nanother on the east.  The flickering of a small fire draws your attention\nto a small hearth set into the wall.  You aren't sure, but there appears\nto be movement in the shadows.\n~\nS\n#17209\nThe kitchen of a stone hut.~\nThe kitchen of this hut is rather crude, but certainly effective.  A\nsmall hearth is set into the wall, with a variety of racks for hanging\npots and kettles.  A long countertop runs along the opposite wall, with\na series of bins for food storage beneath.  You imagine this building\nmight have once been a small cafe.  A curtain covers the entrance to the\nadjoining room to the east, and another door leads to the west.  A window\nset into the north wall admits just enough light to let you look around.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17214\nE\nsouth wall~\nThe stone walls appear to have once been carefully cut to fit.  Recent\nabuse, most likely in the form of clubs, swords and heads being bashed\ninto them, has seriously altered their appearance.  They're pitted all\nover, and large chunks are missing in several places.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof of the hut is very sturdy, and probably does a nice job of\nkeeping the place dry.\n~\nE\nwindow north~\nThrough the dirty window you can just make out the trail running east\nand west through town to the north of the hut.  Across the street you\nsee another stone building.\n~\nE\ngroove gouge~\nThe gouges look to have been made from stuff being thrown into, or at,\nthe box on a regular basis.  Maybe the stockboy wasn't too careful.\n~\nE\nbox bin~\nThe wooden box shows signs of wear, and has a number of grooves and\ngouges, both inside and out.  It is currently empty, however.\n~\nE\ncountertop~\nThe countertop is constructed of thick planking laid across a frame\nof sturdy posts.  It runs the full length of the wall, and a box has\nbeen built beneath it to serve as a storage bin.\n~\nE\nfire hearth~\nA small fire is burning in the hearth, started perhaps to prepare this\nevening's dinner.  Unfortunately, you don't see dinner itself anywhere.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn from clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\nrack pots kettle~\nA crude iron rack hangs above the fire awaiting a pot to hold over the\nfire.  The pots and kettles appear to be clean and usable, but are empty.\nApparently what you smelled from next door was yesterday's leftovers.\n~\nS\n#17210\nBennie's Blacksmith Shop.~\nYou've entered the interior of what was once clearly a blacksmith shop.\nA large hearth sits in the center of the room, providing access from\nall sides.  Rotted shelves line the walls, and a pair of tongs and a\nbillows lie rotting on the countertop.  Though the place might of once\nbeen quite busy, it appears that its better days are long past.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17208\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17212\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is slowly being overtaken by grass.  You attribute the deep\ndepression near the sliding door to the presence of horses once passing\nin and out for shoeing.  Other than this, the floor is bare--long ago\nvictim to the local scavangers.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nShafts of light pierce the weakened roof in many places, suggesting that\nthis building probably isn't very dry in the rain.  The light casts a dim\naura about the room.\n~\nE\nsliding door~\nThe sliding door to the west provides a wide berth to the street when\nopen.  It would appear that this is where Bennie once brought local\nhorses in and out of the building for shoeing.\n~\nE\neast wall~\nThe remains of a long countertop and storage shelves line the east wall.\n~\nE\nhearth~\nA circular hearth sits in the center of the room, built upon a stone\nfoundation.  The interior shows the scars of many fires, and the large\nchunks of rock missing around the edges suggest that perhaps it has\nbeen hit with a hammer repeatedly in the past.  The remains of several\nsmall fires sit in the bottom of the hearth, but you can tell it has\nbeen some time since it hosted a real blacksmith's furnace.\n~\nE\ncounter countertop~\nAt one time, a long countertop served as a workspace, running the entire\nlength of the east wall.  Like the shelves above it, though, it has been\nstripped of all useful pieces, and consists now of nothing more than a\nrotting frame.\n~\nE\nshelf shelves~\nLong, sturdy shelves at one time covered most of the interior walls in this\nbuilding, providing a massive amount of storage space.  Most of the wood\nhas long ago rotted or been removed for use elsewhere in town, though, and\nnot much remains but the frames.\n~\nE\nbillows~\nThere's not much left of the billows but the wooden frame.  It looks\nas though a leather \"bag\" for holding air might once have been attached,\nbut it has long ago rotted.  The only thing these would be useful for\nnow would be the wood scraps.\n~\nE\ntongs~\nThe tongs are old and rusted, and show the wear and tear of being thrusted\ninto the scorching flames time and time again.  Unfortunately, they aren't\nin any condition to salvage.\n~\nS\n#17211\nCrossroads at the center of town.~\nYou stand at the center of town, where the trail forms a sort of a\ncrossroad.  To the north you see a \"street\" that ends in a dead end.  The\nbuildings along each side appear to be nicer than those in the rest of\ntown.  The trail continues east and west through town, and another\nleads south, running between more buildings before it eventually leaves\ntown.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nE\ntrail~\nThe trail continues east and west to the edges of town at least.  To the\nsouth it widens a bit and appears to eventually become a road.\n~\nE\nstreet~\nThe street runs north and comes to an end at a building.  Other\nbuildings line the east and west sides.  It looks a little more promising\nthan the rest of town, and perhaps like it might have been the first\npart of town constructed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy has thinned considerably, and you can see now that the forest\nthins overhead to the west and the south.  Sunlight sneaks through in\nplaces, casting an eerie light over this part of Shadowvale.\n~\nE\ndown mud~\nYuck.  The mud has covered your boots, and you can feel the water seeping\ninto your socks . . ..\n~\nS\n#17212\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to a dead end at the wall of a stone\nbuilding several doors down.  This section of town looks somewhat more\npermanent than the rest, and the buildings are all of stone.  A wooden\ndoor leads to the building to the west, and a large sliding door provides\naccess to the stone building to the east.  To the south lies the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17210\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17217\nE\nslinding door~\nThe large wooden door hangs from a metal rail, and slides to one side\nto provide access to the building.  It would appear to be some sort\nof loading dock, or perhaps a stable door.\n~\nE\nwest structure~\nFour sturdy stone walls uphold the frame of a very old building, yet\nyou can see that the roof is in serious disrepair.  Planks have been\nstripped from the windows and awnings, most likely for use elsewhere in\ntown.  The door is battered, but is closed and probably rusted shut.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy above is much lighter, and you see small patches of sky\nbetween the boughs.  The forest thickens to the east and north, hanging\ndrearily over the edges of the village.  To the south and east it thins,\nand it looks as though the sun may actually be shining through.\n~\nE\ndown trail ground~\nThe trail here is heavily travelled.  It looks like most of the traffic\nleads to the huts at the end, as weeds grow freely along the rest of the\nbuildings.\n~\nE\neast building~\nThe building to the east looks to have once been a store of some sort.\nThe door on this side of the building is large, and slides to one side.\nIt looks like it might have been a loading dock, or maybe even a small\nstable.  A hitching post runs along the side of the building.\n~\nE\npost hitching~\nA worn branch has been mounted across two posts alongside the building.\nAt one time, judging from the considerable wear, many horses were tied\nhere on a regular basis.\n~\nS\n#17213\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail wanders west from the crossroads through another section of\ntown.  The walls of the buildings to the north and south of the crossroads\nlie to each side.  Several other buildings line the trail before it\neventually leads to the edge of town.  To the east lie the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy thins the further west you go, until it eventually\ndisappears somewhere beyond the edge of town.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is still narrow and winding along this stretch of town, but\nit would appear that it widens a bit to the west.\n~\nE\nnorth south walls~\nThe buildings to each side of the trail are made of stone and allow\nno access from this side.  You note that it looks like the roof is\ncollapsing a little on the building to the north.\n~\nS\n#17214\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail passes between two stone structures as it continues north\nand south through town.  To your north lies a small crossroads, and to\nthe south the trail leads to the edge of town.  The hut to the east is\nin good shape, but a door prevents you from seeing inside.  To the west\nlies a stone shanty.  A curtain made of a thick hide is pulled tightly\nacross the doorway, and strange markings are scrawled in red along each\nside of the entrance.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17209\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17228\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here and takes on the appearance of an actual\nroad.  It looks as though this southern route gets used often--the dirt\nis well-packed and the path free from grass.\n~\nE\nmarkings red sign~\nThe markings are in a script you don't recognize, but they have a\ndecidely evil feeling about them.  You get the impression the paint used\nto make them was probably blood . . ..\n~\nE\ncurtain hide~\nThe curtain is simply the hide of a large animal, perhaps an oxen or\nwater buffalo.  It's secured from the top, and seems to be tied loosely\nat the bottom as well.  You should be able to open it, though.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy continues to thin to the south, and the forest retreats\nsomewhat behind the buildings.  It feels a lot less enclosed here.  The\nsun breaks through the trees to warm your face, and a gentle breeze blows\nfrom the south.\n~\nE\nhut~\nThe hut is a fine, stone building.  The exterior masonry is of high \nquality, and the roof is in good shape.  You note a small quantity of smoke\nwafting from the top of the chimney.\n~\nE\nshanty~\nThe shanty is built of loosely-fitted stone which appears to be more\n\"piled\" than \"fitted\".  You can see that the roof is old, but see no\nmajor holes.  It might be a good place to rest . . . if it isn't inhabited.\n~\nS\n#17215\nThe remains of a shack.~\nYou stand in the midst of a deteriorating shack.  It appears as if it was\nonce attached to the store to the south, perhaps as workspace.  Shelves\nline the stone walls, and an old anvil stands in the corner.  The wall to\nthe west is almost entirely collapsed, providing access to the trail\noutside.  To the south a door connects to the storefront.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17210\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nLittle remains of the roof but the rafters, which are now largely\nover-grown with vines.  With a little work, you could find a sheltered\ncorner to rest in.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nGrass has started to re-take the ground inside the hut.  There is still\na lot of bare ground, and it appears as though someone has been sleeping\nhere regularly.\n~\nE\nnorth east wall shelves shelf~\nSturdy shelves have been built directly into the stone walls, providing\na significant amount of storage space.  They have long been stripped of\nanything of value they might once have held, and are home to only dust\nnow.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door isn't too sturdy, and was clearly designed to be an interior\nfixture.  It appears to be in good working condition.\n~\nS\n#17216\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to an end soon at the wall of a stone hut.\nTo the south, it leads back to the center of town.  An empty doorway leads\nto the building to the west, and the wall of the building to the east has\ncollapsed, allowing you access.  The prospects look best to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17219\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17218\nE\ndown trail~\nIt doesn't look much like anyone ever stops here.  The trail is well\nworn running north and south, but weeds cover the ground to the east and\nwest.  You note a slight rise as the trail runs north.\n~\nE\nup~\nIt's amazing how fast the canopy thickens, and a dull grey has set in\nabout you.  You can see that the edge of the forst lies just beyond the\nbuildings in all directions, and you're surprised that is hasn't yet\nengulfed the whole town.\n~\nE\ncollapsed wall rubble~\nThe remains of the wall consist of large stones and mortar.  It won't\ntake much effort to climb over it.\n~\nS\n#17217\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17218\nA sturdy lean-to.~\nAll that remains of the once proud stone building that stood here is the\nfront wall.  The back wall is partially collapsed, and is now a waist-high\npile of rubble.  Some enterprising resident has constructed a roof between\nthe two walls by laying branches and reeds across a series of slim poles.\nIt's not pretty, but it's clean and looks rather comfortable.  The trail\nlies to the east.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nnorth south~\nThe walls of the neighboring building are covered with scattered vines\nand large patches of mold.  Not very attractive, but interesting . . ..\n~\nE\nbranches reed roof ceiling~\nMost of the original branches used to create the ceiling are long-dead\nand starting to rot.  The mass of vegetation from the forest beyond has\ngrown over much of it, though, and has nicely filled gaps as they formed.\n~\nE\nrubble back~\nThe pile of rubble, which consists of mostly large blocks of stone,\nstands about chest-high to a dwarf.  You'd probably have to crawl to\nactually get back to it . . . and it certainly doesn't look like it's\nworth the effort.\n~\nS\n#17219\nThe end of the dead-end street.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the wall of a large stone structure.  It's\nhard to tell for sure, but you'd guess that the building to the north is\npart of either the building to the east or west, or maybe both.  A sturdy\noak door covers the entrance of the shack to the east, and a strong, solid\niron door blocks the entrance to the hut to your west.  You can try your\nluck with either of those, or take the trail back to the south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17220\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17223\nE\nup~\nYou feel claustrophobic beneath the shadow of the overhanging trees\nalong this end of the street.  The owners of these homes obviously didn't\nchoose the location for the wealth of sunlight it offers.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail branches neatly to the left and right to the entrances of the\ntwo buildings.  It would seem that the residents use it a lot.\n~\nE\nnorth wall~\nIt's as good a wall as you've ever seen, but that's about it.  It looks\nlike someone might even be clearing the vines off of it on occasion.\n~\nE\nsturdy oak~\nThe door is made of heavy oak planks that bear the scars of many seasons.\nIt looks like it might bear the scars of a few swordfights as well.  It's\nno worse for the wear, though, and if it's locked you won't likely be\ngetting in without a key.\n~\nE\niron~\nThis huge door is constructed of solid iron, decorated with the occasional\nrivet to hold the hinges and latch.  Considering that it's attached to a\nwindowless stone building, you imagine it might once have been a bank or\nsome other important structure.\n~\nS\n#17220\nLiving room of a small house.~\nYou can see, now that you are inside, that this shack is actually more\nof a home.  Sparse furnishings litter the room, and a picture hangs on the\nwall above a small fireplace.  It's actually rather cozy.  The front\ndoor leads back to the trail, and another door leads north to an adjoining\nroom.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17221\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17219\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nThis house has a proper roof, with relatively new planking serving to\nkeep the elements at bay.  You venture a guess that someone probably\nlives here regularly.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is nothing but packed and swept dirt, but it has aged well\nand is very clean.  You're surprised, in fact, at how clean this whole\nplace is.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls of cut stone are clean and free of the mold you see growing\non other buildings in Shadowvale.  The more you look it over, the more\nyou like this place.\n~\nE\npicture~\nA drawing of an ugly giant in a crude wood frame hangs slightly askew\non the wall.  The inscription below reads \"Brutus\".  You wonder if it's\ntrue that a mother always thinks her child is cute . . . and, if so, just\nwhat Brutus' mother might look like . . ..\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nA small stone hearth set into the stone wall flickers brightly from the\nsmall fire within.  The rack inside suggests it might also be used for\ncooking as well.\n~\nS\n#17221\nBrutus' Guest Room.~\nThis room is nicely furnished with a bed, a small nightstand and a desk.\nAgain, it is spotless.  You realize now that this is probably the guest\nquarters for the larger house across the street to the west.  This looks\nlike it would be a nice place to rest, or the door to the south will\ntake you back to the living room.\n~\n0 D 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17220\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof in this room is the same as that in the adjoining room, and it\nseems to be connected to the building next door.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor here is well-kept as well.  A nice rug made from the skin of\nsome unknown animal lies alongside the bed, and there's not a dust ball\nto be found.\n~\nE\nbed~\nThe bed is nothing but a simple cot, but it looks plenty comfortable.\n~\nE\nrug skin~\nThe hide is a dark black in color, with thick, coarse hair.  If pressed\nfor an answer, you'd guess it was from a large bear.\n~\nE\nnight stand table~\nA small wooden table serves as a nightstand next to the bed.  An oil\nlamp, built into the center of the table, provides light for the room.\n~\nE\noil lamp~\nIt's a very simple lamp, but it's unique in that it's somehow fixed\nto the table.  It's much to awkward to be of use anywhere else, and\nserves its purpose here very well.\n~\nE\nwalls north west east~\nThe stone walls are almost polished from constant brushing and cleaning.\nYou're impressed at the effort put into the upkeep of this place,\nespecially when you consider the neighborhood.\n~\nS\n#17222\nInside Windrunner's Crystal Ball~\nYou find yourself suspended in the air amidst a kaleidoscope of swirling\nmist.  After a moment, you realize you have been transferred to the inside\nof Windrunner's Crystal Ball--where he puts imputent mortals he needs to\nattend to . . ..  You feel it would be best to wait and see what he wants.\n~\n0 CDKNT 9\nO windrunner~\nE\nmist swirling~\nThe mist swirls about you in a fantastic variety of colors.  You find the\neffect almost mesmerizing.\n~\nS\n#17223\nThe entrance to Brutus' house.~\nYou've entered a small room that serves as the foyer for a rather\nlarge hut.  Actually, it's almost a house.  Several pairs of boots\nare lined neatly along the wall, and above them a series of hooks\nwait patiently for someone to hang a coat on them.  Other than this, the\nroom is bare.  You hear voices coming from the adjoining room to the\nnorth, and an iron door leads east.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17224\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17219\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe sturdy roof is constructed of heavy planking across a timber frame.\nFrom the looks of it, this house was built to endure.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor, though generally free of debris, is a bit muddy.  You hope it\ndoesn't mess up your nice boots.\n~\nE\nwest south wall~\nThe walls are made of large stone blocks, cut to fit tightly.  They are\nworn smooth with age, but remain sturdy.  Spikes have been driven into\nthem in various places to serve as hangers.\n~\nE\nspike hanger~\nIt's your basic metal spike . . . and it's driven securely into the wall.\n~\nE\niron door~\nThe heavy iron door looks a lot less imposing from the inside than it\ndid from the trail.  In fact, you're guessing it isn't solid at all, and\nis probably just a facade to fool the local \"wildlife\".\n~\nE\nboots~\nThe boots are smelly and worn, and you decide quickly you don't really\nwant to examine them further . . . ..\n~\nS\n#17224\nBrutus' Waiting Room.~\nYou are in what appears to be a waiting room, or perhaps a common room,\nfor the larger house about you.  The room is bare except for three logs\nthat serve as chairs and a picture on the wall.  A torch affixed to the\nwall provides enough light for you to see back into the entryway to the\nsouth, but, strangely, you see no other doors.  You could have sworn that\nfrom the outside this place looked a lot bigger . . ..\n  Maybe you were wrong.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17225\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17223\nE\ntorch~\nIt's a simple torch, and it's secured to the wall . . . .\n~\nE\npicture~\nA charcoal sketch of a giant, who appears to be a thief, adorns the\neast wall.  It's not life-size, but it's at least four feet in height.\nThe word \"Brutus\" is written along the bottom of the sketch.  You're\ncertain that Brutus isn't the type of guy you'd want to invite to your\nMom's house for dinner . . ..\n~\nE\nwest north wall~\nThe walls, though clean, are unadorned.  Someone must have figured they\nwere working hard enough just holding up the ceiling.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling in this room takes on a slight A-Frame appearance.  You\njudge from its construction that this room was built sometime before,\nand in a much better fashion, than the entryway to the south.\n~\nS\n#17225\nBrutus' bedroom.~\nYou've entered Brutus' private sanctuary.  A small desk sits in the corner,\nand is covered in slips of paper and ledgers.  Apparently Brutus is the\nhead honcho in these parts.  A bedroll is unrolled in front of the hearth,\nwhere a small fire warms the room.  You can exit to the west through the\nsecret door, or another door will take you north.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17226\nD3\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17224\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16451 0 11185\nE\nsecret picture~\nTo the west a hole has been roughly hewn into the wall, and you can see\nthat it's been covered with a crudely fashion door to which the picture\nwas then mounted.  Very ingenious.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt is clean, except for small piles of wood\nscraps around the hearth.  The bedroll occupies a corner of the room.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is constructed of spaced planks with wood shingles laid over\nthem.  It would seem that this isn't the orginal roof, and that perhaps\nBrutus had some work done recently.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls are made of stone and mortar.  They're discolored with age,\nbut basically in good shape.\n~\nE\nbedroll~\nThe bedroll is nothing but an old, ratty blanket, and you imagine it's\nprobably the source fo the horrible smell in the room.\n~\nE\nhearth fire~\nA small hearth is set into the wall, and a fire has recently been started.\nIt looks like Brutus was settling in for the evening.\n~\nE\nslips paper ledger~\nSeveral slips marked \"I.O.U.\" lay scattered about a large ledger.  In it\nBrutus seems to be tracking his income.  It looks like he's not only\ntrafficking in stolen merchandise, but collecting \"taxes\" from the local\nresidents as well.  From what you know about numbers, Brutus appears to\nbe doing very nicely for himself.\n~\nE\ndesk~\nIt's a small, simple desk.  It's made of wood, with a stone top.  There\nare holes in the front where drawers used to be, but Brutus seems to have\nfound little use for them.\n~\nS\n#17226\nBrutus' closet.~\nThis small closet is where Brutus probably keeps his inventory.  Too bad\nfor you his stock seems to be depleted.  The door to the south takes you\nback to the main bedroom.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17225\nD5\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17227\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling of the closet slopes steeply as it's near the edge of the\nhut.  Other than a few rope marks where someone seems to have hung something\nheavy, there's little of interest up there.\n~\nE\nnorth west east walls~\nThe closet has the same stone walls as the rest of the hut . . . what\ndid you expect?\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the closet isn't as clean as the floor of the room outside.\nIn fact, it looks a bit like the dirt has been recently disturbed . . ..\n~\nS\n#17227\nBrutus' secret storage room.~\nThat Brutus, he's a pretty smart guy.  The room has been dug beneath\nthe closet, and is rather crude.  It's big enough to store quite a bit\nof illegal merchandise in, though--even if it doesn't stay very clean.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD4\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17226\nE\nnorth south east west down walls dirt~\nThe walls are dirt, and they aren't very well-supported.  Little bits\nhave caved in here and there, and in several spots it looks like sharp\nweapons, maybe spears, were stuck into the walls for storage.  You wonder\nhow many good rains it will take until this whole end of the house sinks\ninto the ground.\n~\nE\nup secret~\nYou can see from below that the secret door is made from thick planks,\nand is laid across the top of the hole.  Brutus made it thick enough to\nseem real when he closed it and spread the dirt over it--but he just\nain't as smart as you, is he?\n~\nS\n#17228\nThe Cleric's Shanty.~\nThe small altar in the corner suggests that this shack is the home of\nthe local priest.  Other than the altar and a small cot, the room is bare\nof furnishings and possessions.  The door to the east leads back to the\ntrail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17214\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt shows a worn path from the door to the altar.\nIt would seem many have made that particular walk.  It would also seem\nthat they have tracked all sorts of dirt and other gross things in with\nthem.  You can see why the priest made the cot.\n~\nE\ncot bed~\nA simple cot, consisting of a board laid across to pieces of firewood,\nsits in the corner of the shack.  It looks really uncomfortable, but\nyou could see the advantages of it over, say, sleeping on the floor.\n~\nE\ndoor curtain hide~\nThe door to the shack consists of a simple hide nail to the upper\ncorners.  Apparently the priest trusts his clientele a little more\nthat you would.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is made of randomly over-laid planks.  The gaps\nare plugged with rags and other assorted materials, and the effort looks\nto be mildly successful.\n~\nE\nnorth west south walls~\nThe walls of the shack are simply planks, coated with a thin film of\nwhat looks like mud.  If it was an attempt at plaster, it was a very bad\none.  They do serve to keep the elements at bay, however . . ..\n~\nS\n#17229\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail continues north and south through Shadowvale.  To the north\nyou see a crossroads and what appears to be a fountain.  To the south,\nthe trail becomes a road out of town.  A poorly-constructed shack lies\nto your east, while a much nicer one lies to the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17230\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor flimsy~\n16387 0 17231\nE\ntrail down~\nThe trail leads north and south here, and appears to be heavily-trodden.\n~\nE\nwest shack~\nTo the west sits a nice shack that has been connected directly to the\nbuilding to the north and the ruins to the south.  A flimsy door has\nbeen set into the entrance, and a small window sits off to one side of\nthe door.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the trees above in various places, dispelling\nsome of the eerie shadows from the trees above.  This place is still\ndefinitely on the wierd side of creepy, though.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is covered in dirt.  As you wipe a spot clean, you note that\nthe curtains are drawn and you can't see in anyway.\n~\nE\ndoor flimsy~\nThe door most likely keeps out nothing but the rain.  Still, it'd be\neasier to open it than to kick it in . . ..\n~\nS\n#17230\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more than planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.  You might want to use the door to the west to get back on the\ntrail and out of harm's way.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nE\nplanks patch scrap~\nThe planks are of varying sizes and shapes, and, it would appear,\nthickness.  They are spotted with pieces of cloth, hide and anything\nelse that was available to keep out the rain.\n~\nE\nnorth east south walls~\nThe walls, such as they are, are a conglomeration of materials put\ntogether as availability and need dictated.  \"Mess\" is the first word\nthat comes to mind.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17231\nThe common shack.~\nThis well-maintained shack seems to serve as a common home to a variety\nof Shadowdale's residents.  Several bedrolls cover the floor, and gear\nof all kinds sits about the room.  You get the feeling, however, that the\nresidents wouldn't be ideal roommates . . ..  Doors lead east and west to\ninevitably safer territory.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor east flimsy~\n16387 0 17229\nD3\nExit ~\nback door west~\n16387 0 17250\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the shack consists entirely of tightly-packed dirt.  Not \nmuch, but it's a dry place to sleep.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is mostly branches woven into a tight sheet.\nYou get the feeling it probably leaks when it rains.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe doors of this shack are simply weather-worn planks tied together\nalong cross-supports.  You could probably put your fist through them if\nyou had to, but it would be easier just to open them . . .\n~\nE\nnorth south wall~\nThe walls of the shack are simple, unadorned planks, many of which seem\nto have come from other buildings . . ..\n~\nE\ngear~\nA variety of gear in states of general mis-use lie about the room.  While\nsome of it may once have been useful, it's all junk now.\n~\nE\nbed bedrolls~\nSeveral piles of hides lie scattered about the room serving as beds.\nThey look as if they are used regularly.\n~\nS\n#17232\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail winds between two more buildings before it leads south out of\ntown.  As it leaves town, the trail leads slowly down into a wide valley.\nThe trees continue to thin in that direction, and you can't be sure, but\nyou think you see the glint of sunlight reflecting off water far down in\nthe valley.  The trail leads north back into town.  To the west are the\ncharred remains of a burned-out building, and to the east a sturdy, well-\nbuilt shack.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17233\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17235\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17234\nE\nshack hut east~\nThe hut to the east is constructed mostly of stone.  \"Patches\" of planks,\nmortar, branches and vines cover holes where larger stones have broken\nloose from the foundation.  The repairs look almost as sturdy as the\nremaining foundation, if not moreso.  It's clearly an old building, but\nsomeone is making an effort to keep it well-maintained.\n  A solid oak door is set into the doorway, blocking your view inside.\n~\nE\nvine patch mortar branch~\nSomeone seems to have patched holes in the foundation of the hut with\na mixture of muddy mortar and branches.  Vines have taken root, providing\nan overlying web of flora.  The patches give the hut a very \"earthy\"\nappearance, almost like a large, moss-covered rock with a nice patch\nof sod growing on top.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is well-trodden here, and it appears many pairs of boots have\nmade the journey south.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun struggles to break through the canopy here, and it appears to\nbe having much more success to the south.  You see birds among the boughs\nof the oaks again, and the chatter of squirrels filters down from far\nabove.\n~\nE\ndoor oak plank~\nThe door to this hut has been cut from a single width of hard oak\nplanking.  It looks very secure, which is good, but rare, in this\nneighborhood.  If it's locked, it would probably be easier to cut a\nhole in the wall than to break it down.\n~\nS\n#17233\nA well-built hut.~\nYou have entered a very comfortable shack.  Though the only furniture\nis a bed in one corner, the shack appears to have been recently cleaned.\nThe walls are solid, and the roof is strong enough to keep out the rain.\nWhat a wonderful place to hide away and rest.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17232\nE\noak plank~\nThe door looks as solid from the inside as it did from outside.  You\nadmire the beautiful grain of the wood . . .\n~\nE\nup~\nThe hut has a sod roof, supported by long, straight limbs culled from\nthe surrounding forest.  Someone did a very nice job of building it.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor of the hut is basically hard-packed dirt.  However, it's\npacked very well, and is almost as solid as stone.\n~\nE\nwalls east north south~\nThe walls of the hut consist of a waist-high stone foundation and smooth\nplanks above that.  They are entirely bare, and could use some decoration.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe door looks just as good inside, and is in very good shape.  If you\nwere to close it, it would probably keep unwanted characters out.\n~\nS\n#17234\nThe remains of a burned building.~\nYou stand amidst the charred ruins of what once might have been a very\nnice shack.  There certainly was a lot of wood in it, as the ashes are\nknee deep and charcoal beams still attempt to hold a roof that no longer\nexists.  You might find something if you rummage, but the place looks\nlike it's been well-scavanged.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\nvegetation forest vines~\nBranches from the forest beyond have grown through the remaining wall\nsupports, protruding into the room.  Large vines have used the branches\nto bridge their way in as well, and are slowly overtaking the area.  You\nare amazed at the resilience of the forest behind the building, and can't\neven imagine how horrible it would be to get stuck in it.\n~\nE\nashes ruins~\nDeep piles of gray ashes, matted into flat mounds by wind and rain,\nprovide an eerie backdrop for the grim black beams which rise like the\ntrees on some lost desert plain.  This place is creepy, even by local\nstandards.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest has already begun to reclaim the back wall of the house.  The\nvines have made themselves at home on the remaining wall supports, and\nhave created an impassable wall of vegetation.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nA short stone foundation survived on the southern side of the lot, \ndefiantly supporting the last remains of the only thing that can be clearly\nidentified as a wall.  Through the remains you can see that the forest\nappears to thin to the south, and you see the trail leading south into\nthe woods just in front of the building.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nThe owners of the building to the north seem to have salvaged a lot of\nthe useful materials from this site, and used them to re-build their\nsouthern wall.  They didn't do a very good job, though, and none of the\npieces fit together.  Cracks and holes appear all over.\n~\nE\nhole crack~\nYou can make out faint shapes inside the shack.  It's too dark to be\nsure, but judging from the whispering and sounds of shuffling, it sounds\nlike the residents might be home . . . and there's more than one person\nat home.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe gray ashes are a little damp, and are making a mess of your boots.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is much thinner here than at the northern edges of town, and\nthe occasional ray of sun sneaks through.  It appears that the trees\ncontinue to thin to the south.\n~\nS\n#17235\nA trail leading south out of town.~\nYou stand on the southern edge of the small village of Shadowvale.  The\ntown, which spreads out to your north, has a dark and menacing feel about\nit--even here you feel many eyes watching you.  The road continues north\ninto town, or south to the thinner forest and, eventually, foreign realms.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\ndown trail road~\nThe road is clear and well-marked as it leaves town to the south.  To\nthe north, it appears to lead into the heart of the village.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe thin forest to the west holds little of interest for you, though you\ndo see the remains of a burned-out building to the west of your trail--\nright on the edge of the approaching village.\n~\nE\neast~\nYou see a shack sitting along the east side of the road just north of here,\nmarking the entrance to a village.  The forest is just thin enough that\nyou could leave the trail without getting too horribly lost, but you see\nnothing of interest that would justify the effort.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun beams down upon you brightly as you look up to see squirrels\nplaying among the trees.  The forest is very peaceful here, but turns\ndark and ominous just to the north.\n~\nE\nsign~\n----------------\n    |  Sorry Brave   |\n    | Adventurers... |\n    |                |\n    |     The        |\n    |   Southern     |\n    |    Realms      |\n    |   Are Still    |\n    |     Under      |\n    |  Construction  |\n     ----------------\n           | |\n           | |\n~\nS\n#17236\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trees thin considerably along this stretch of the trail, and sunlight\nbeams warmly upon you.  An empty lot lies to your north, and you can see\na small grove of pine trees lying just beyond.  To your south are the\nremains of an old shack.  The trail to the west leads to the edge of town,\nand there appears to be a crossroads further into town to the east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17237\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is almost clear at this spot.  It would seem the locals have\nharvested a few trees in the surrounding area.  Mmmmm, that sun feels \ngood, eh?\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-trodden, and continues to widen to the west.\n~\nE\nsouth remains shack~\nThe shack is in major disrepair, but still standing.  It might still\nprovide shelter . . . if you can wedge yourself into a dry corner.  The\ndoorway is empty, the door long-ago stolen for some other housing project.\n~\nS\n#17237\nA campsite in an empty lot.~\nThis vacant lot has been used as a campsite so many times that it has\ntaken on a permanent appearance.  The remains of several fires are\nscattered about the site, and a pine grove that begins on the north\nend of the lot provides nice cover for sleeping.  You can go into the\ngrove to your north, or to the trail through town to the south.

You can make out a clearing to the north in the pine\ngrove, and taller weeds along the walls on each side of the lot provide\nnice protection from the wind.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest has thinned to only scattered trees, and the sun beams down\nupon the lot.  Shade can be gained under the pines to the north, and you\ncan see the forest rising above the far side of the grove.\n~\nE\neast west wall~\nA barrier of weeds and shrubs rings the lot along the edges of the\nneighboring buildings.  The walls appear to be solid and offer no access\nto the inside of either structure.\n~\nE\ncampfire fire~\nSeveral blackened circles surrounded with stones are scattered about\nthe lot.  Half-burned logs, apparently from the pine forest, lie rotting\naround the edges of each site.\n~\nS\n#17238\nA small pine grove.~\nYou have wandered into a small pine grove tucked away behind the homes\nin this area.  The underbrush has been tamed in this clearing, and the\nfresh scent of the small pines is quite refreshing.  The grove continues\nto your north and west.  To your east lies the back wall of a shack, and\nto the south a campsite.  It appears that the pine needles which litter\nthe ground would make a wonderful place to sleep.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17239\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17237\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17241\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees at the front of the grove look young and healthy, as if \nperhaps they are thinned regularly, or used for firewood.  They provide\nnice shelter for the grove, though they aren't much for climbing.\n~\nE\nwall shack east~\nThe wall of the shack is overgrown with flowery vines.  There do not\nappear to be any windows or other distinguishing features.\n~\nE\nflowery vines~\nThe vines appear to be from the morning glory family.  They cover the\nwall in thick patterns, sprouting patches of beautiful purple teacup\nshaped flowers here and there.  Insects and small birds play contentedly\nin the cover they provide.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe bed of pine needles which covers the ground is quite thick.  There\nare patches here and there where piles of needles have been gathered, most\nlikely for use in building fire.  The softness of the ground is a welcome\ntreat for your aching feet.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe boughs of the pines dance lightly in the wind overhead.  Birds and\nsquirrels ramble aimlessly among the branches searching for food.\n~\nS\n#17239\nA small pine grove.~\nThe serenity of the pine grove calms your anxieties as you venture\ndeeper within.  The heavy undergrowth of the forest once again rises to\nchoke out the pines and block passage to the north, and the back of\na house lies to your east.  The grove continues west and south . . . \nsuddenly, a loud cry captures your attention, and it appears to be coming\nfrom the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nE\npine tree~\nYou're amazed that these little trees do so well in the midst of the\ndark forest.  They can't be over 20 feet tall, and it's almost as if\nmagic protects them from the darkness around them.\n~\nE\nforest vines undergrowth~\nThe forest rises quickly above the grove, the undergrowth rising at its\nfeet to form a wall of vegetation that is clearly impassable.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe inside of the house is dimly lit, but you can clearly make out the\nshapes of two large \"men\" sitting around a table.  You make a mental note\nof the house's location so as not to accidentally wander in on them.\n~\nE\neast house shack~\nThe house to the east appears to be constructed of stone, and is in\nvery good shape.  Vines cover the back wall, but you can make out a window\nhidden behind a patch of flowers.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe soft needles here are not as nice as the ones at the entrance to\nthe grove . . . mushrooms, vines and other offshoots frmo the forest\nfight for a foothold.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy of the neighboring forest towers above the edge of the grove,\nreminding you again of the ominous nature of the entire village.  Once\nagain, life appears almost non-existent overhead . . . though you do feel\nthe odd sensation of being watched . . ..\n~\nS\n#17240\nA small pine grove.~\nThere is a small clearing in the pine forest, and a lone pine tree \nstands in the northwest corner of the grove.  As you peer intently\nup into the branches, you see a large owl's nest perched just out of\nreach.  The forest blocks passage to the north and west, and the rest\nof the pine grove lies east and south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17239\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17241\nE\nwest north forest undergrowth~\nOnce again the forest has pushed so densely against the grove that\npassage is impossible.  It looks pretty spooky anyway . . ..\n~\nE\ntree pine~\nThe pine tree stands alone in the corner of the clearing, as if holding\noff the forest by itself.  It provides a perfect perch for the owl to\nsurvey the grove, and plenty of room to swoop quickly down upon its\nunsuspecting dinner guests.\n~\nE\nnest~\nThe owl's nest looks to be about a yard in width, and is constructed\nof twigs and leaves wedged into a deep hole in the tree.  It sits just\nout of your reach . . . and the tree offers no branches for you to climb.\n~\nE\nskeleton~\nThe skeleton appears to be that of a rat, or perhaps a small cat.  It\nis about the right size for an owl's dinner.  It's best left alone.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe ground is relatively clear here--a perfect area for an owl's\nhunting grounds.  A small skeleton lies half-covered in pine needles,\nbut you see no other signs that anyone has been here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest hangs precariously above the pine grove, drowning out most\nof the light.  Besides the owl's nest, there are few signs of life here.\n~\nS\n#17241\nA small pine grove.~\nThis corner of the pine grove is very pleasant, and is by far the\nbrightest.  The forest closes in to block passage to the west, and adds\nan ominous gloom to an otherwise nice place.  The wall of a stone building\nlies to your south, and the pine grove runs to the east and north.  You\nhear a strange, hair-tingling shriek in the latter direction.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nE\ndown needles~\nThere are signs that others have been here before you.  The needles\nshow places where several others have rested, at least one of whom was\nbleeding . . . the trail of blood leads off to the north.\n~\nE\nstone wall house building~\nThe back of the house is simply a rock wall, offering no windows or\ndoors for passage.\n~\nE\nwest forest undergrowth~\nThough it appears that the forest thins a bit to the west, there's no\nway you're going to get there from here to find out.  It's almost as if\nsomeone has been encouraging the forest to form a wall . . . it's hard\nto believe it could be so consistently unpassable on it's own.\n~\nE\nbirds~\nThe birds appear to be only sparrows, and they're far out of your\nreach.  There's probably a better meal to be had somewhere else.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou spot several birds fluttering around amongst the pines, and hear\nthe distinct sounds of squirrels playing out of sight.\n~\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees provide a nice amount of cover here, and it would be a\nwonderful place to kick back and ponder the mysteries of life . . ..\n~\nS\n#17242\nThe remains of a shack.~\nThis shack has pretty much reached the end of its useful life.  The\nroof has collapsed in upon the interior, and most anything of use was\nlong ago stripped and salvaged.  You can climb across the rubble, where\na small clearing seems to sit in back of the building to the south, or\nexit to the path through town to the north.  To the east lies the exterior\nwall of a sturdy building, and to the west you see a hide-covered hut,\nbut no way to enter it.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nE\neast building wall~\nThe bare face of a stone wall forms the back of the building to the east.\nThere would appear to be no access from this side.\n~\nE\nwest hide hut~\nTo the west you can just make out what looks like an igloo made of\nanimal skins tucked within the trees.  However, you can't tell much more\nthan that from this vantage point.\n~\nE\nrubble~\nThe rubble would appear to be the remains of a rock wall which fell\nvictim to the elements some time ago.  It is now only a waist-high pile\nof rocks and boards.  You should be able to climb over it easily to get\nto the clearing beyond.\n~\nE\ndown~\nGrass and a variety of weeds have started to re-establish themselves now\nthat the shack has collapsed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees have thinned overhead, but the sun isn't at the proper angle\nto reach this particular lot.  Too bad, the grass could use some help.\n~\nS\n#17243\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYour attention is immediately drawn to the hut to the south, which appears\nto be constructed of animal hides and stands out awkwardly from the forest.\nTo your north is the stone wall of an old hut, the entrance of which lies\nfurther to the west.  The edge of town lies to your west, and the trail\neast will take you into the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17247\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\nhut hide~\nFrom the trail, it looks as though the hut is made of a large segment\nof leather pulled taught over some sort of from.  Further inspection\nmight provide more insights.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou are clearly near the western edge of the forest, as the trees become\nmuch thicker, and ominously darker, the further east you look.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-packed and dry.  It looks like many pairs of\nfeet, and in some cases multiple pairs, have used the trail recently.\n~\nE\nwall stone~\nExcept for a few small vines and some patches of fungus, the stone wall\nis bare.  You can tell from the outside that the door to this building is\nthe one just west of here.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nYou'll have to go a little farther west down the trail to see the door\nproperly.\n~\nS\n#17244\nA storage closet.~\nThe closet is very plain.  Several nails have been pounded into the\nwalls to serve as hooks, and the floor is scratched from the occasional\ntrunk that has been dragged in and out.  It is otherwise very clean\nand somewhat secure.  It's value as a hideout might outweigh its\noriginal purpose.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17245\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is simply a series of planks embedded in the ground, but it's\nlevel and dry.  It would certainly be among the cleaner places you've\nrested today . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of the hut appears to be made of planks, sealed here and there\nwith patches of sod.  It's not much, but it would likely keep you dry\nin the rain.\n~\nE\neast north south walls~\nThe walls are bare, but sturdy.\n~\nE\ndoor west~\nThe door separates the closet from the main room of the shack.  When\nclosed, it provides decent privacy.\n~\nS\n#17245\nThe Warrior's Shack.~\nYou have entered a well-kept shack that appears to belong to a warrior\nwho has taken up long-term residence in Shadowvale.  Though plain and\nunfurnished, the stone walls provide protection from the elements and,\nwell, at least the door works.  The trail through town lies to the\nsouth, and a door is set into the eastern wall.\n~\n0 D 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17244\nD2\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17246\nE\nnorth west walls~\nThe stone walls are well-constructed, and on the inside, at least, are\nin good shape.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of this shack actually has shingles, though light shows \nthrough in the corners of the room.  It's better than sleeping in the rain.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in oak planking.  It's worn, but not deteriorating.\nIt's certainly good enough to keep most of the bugs out of your bedroll.\n~\nE\ndoor east~\nThe door to the east isn't as solid as the exterior door, and appears\nto lead to a storage room or closet.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door to the outside is quite sturdy, and will definitely keep out\nwandering fidos and other undesirables.\n~\nS\n#17246\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYou stand at the western-most edge of a small village tucked within\nthe forest.  The town spreads out to the east, hidden beneath the quickly\ndarkening forest.  An air of gloom hangs over the grove, and you see\nlittle movement in the streets.  To your north lies an entrance to\na sturdy stone hut, but a wooden door blocks any view inside.  To your\nsouth is a dilapitated shack--the door is closed, but you can't imagine\nwhy anyone would bother.  The trail leaves town to your west, and leads\ninto the center of town (as well as the deeper forest) to your east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17245\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17248\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17249\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens as it leaves town to the west.  To the east, it becomes\nnarrower as it winds between the scattered buildings and trees.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is open and airy above you, and squirrels frolic among the\nboughs.  You can see that the trees slowly fade to the west, while to the\neast the canopy thickens and eventually fades into darkness.\n~\nE\nsouth shack~\nThe dilapitated shack to the south appears ready to collapse in on\nitself.  The walls are old and rotted, and large chunks of the roof\nare missing.  The well-worn path to the door suggests that someone\nis still using it regularly, despite its condition.\n~\nE\nwooden door~\nIt's a wooden door--your time would be better spent trying to open it.\n~\nE\nnorth stone hut~\nThe sturdy hut is built from cut limestone and looks to be kept up\nregularly.  You judge from the building pattern that it probably also\nextends to the east, but you see no entrance in that direction.  The\nwooden door is closed, but looks like it probably works.\n~\nS\n#17247\nA hut covered in animal hides.~\nHides have been stretched across a frame of bent branches to form a\ndomed hut among the trees.  The floor is clean and dry, and someone\nhas recently been building fires in the center of the room.  A shaft\nof sunlight pierces the hole in the roof which serves as a chimney,\nand casts a dim light about the room.  The doorway to the north leads\nback to the trail.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nstraw pile~\nIt would seem the current occupant is using the pile of straw as a bed.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt has been carefully maintained.  It is smooth\nand, except for a pile of straw in the corner, free of debris.\n~\nE\nhole up~\nYou can just make out the boughs of the trees as the wind blows them\nback and forth above the hut.  The hole is about a dagger's length\nacross--just enough to draw the smoke out, and not enough to let the\nrain in.\n~\nE\nbranches~\nThe branches appear to be taken from willow trees.  About a dozen of\nthem rise around the edge of the cirular shelter, and are tied with\ntwine where they meet at the top.\n~\nE\nhide walls skins~\nThe hides appear to be from a wide variety of animals.  Large skins,\nmost likely from wolves and bears, form the majority of the structure,\nand smaller skins have been used to fill the gaps.  Overall, the work\nis excellent.\n~\nS\n#17248\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17249\nThe trail leading out of Shadowvale.~\nThe trail leads east into a small village hidden within the edge of\nthe forest.  To the west the forest thins and eventually fades altogether.\nSquirrels and other wildlife play in the light cover near the trail, and\nyou can hear the chatter of birds in the surrounding canopy.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail looks well-travelled to the east toward town, but fades here\nand can't be seen to the west.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest thins to the west, but you can't make out the lands beyond.\nThe trail ends here, however, so there can't be too much out there . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the canopy in many places, leaving misty trails\nas it seeks out the ground below.  You notice the eerie contrast with\nthe forest to the east, which quickly becomes dark and menacing.\n~\nE\nnorth south forest~\nThe forest around you consists of random trees scattered among a low\ncovering of bushes and vines.  It has a rather cheerful feel about it,\nand you note a wide range of scents in the air.\n~\nS\n#17250\nA small clearing in the woods.~\nA small clearing has been created just behind the shacks along this\nrow.  Piles of garbage sit rotting along the edge of the forest, which\ncloses quickly in against the southern and western edges of the lot.\nThere are signs of a trail entering the underbrush to the west, but it\nis difficult to make out where it might go.  The back door of a shack\nlies to your east, and the remains of a fallen building lie north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD1\nExit ~\nback door east~\n16387 0 17231\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nE\ndown~\nThe clearing is covered in a soft, green turf.  If it weren't for the\nstink of rotting garbage, it'd be a nice place to rest for awhile.\n~\nE\nup~\nNo trees grow in the lot, and the refreshing glow of sunlight enhances\nthe area.  You can tell from the canopy though that this might be the only\nsunny spot for some distance in any direction.\n~\nE\ntrail west~\nThere appears to be a path leading into the forest at the western edge\nof the clearing, but the undergrowth is so heavy it is hard to be sure.\n~\nE\npile garbage~\nIt looks as if someone has been tossing the remains of meals, and perhaps\nworse, along the edges of this lot.  Even if there was something of value\nburied deep in there, you doubt it's worth enough to dig around and find\nit.\n~\nE\nback door east~\nThe door is simply a variety of random boards and planks tied together\nwith string and vines.  Nice effort, but certainly better at keeping\nout the wind than hearty adventurers like yourself.\n~\nS\n#17251\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail plunges into the forest, and the vegetation immediately\npresses in against you.  It appears that the trail continues south, and\nreturns east to the clearing.\n~\n0 A 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17252\nE\ndown trail~\nThe ground is covered in vegetation, and vines reach out to snag your\nfeet and armor.  The trail is faint, but after a few seconds you can\nsee that it clearly goes south, if anywhere . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest above is so thick that light can hardly penetrate.  The\nlower branches are covered in vines, and you can't see any further into\nthe forest in this direction than in any other.\n~\nE\nwest north forest underbrush~\nThe undergrowth is thick in this part of the forest.  You think the\nbacks of the buildings along the main trail should be to your north, but\nit is impossible to see more than several feet into the vegetation.\nThe trail is the only possible means of passage through this area.\n~\nS\n#17252\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the forest edge.  Vegetation presses in\nfrom the south, east and west preventing further passage.  A strange bush\nprotruding from the forest edge to the west captures your attention.\n~\n0 A 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17253\nE\ndown~\nThick sod, covered in leaves and decaying branches, covers the forest\nfloor.  You feel you should watch carefully where you are walking so\nas not to entangle yourself in the vines.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees grow low over the path, and the vines growing from the\nbranches hang just out of reach.  A wave of claustrophobia overcomes\nyou, and you feel the urge to turn and run.\n~\nE\nsouth east forest underbrush~\nThe underbrush almost reaches out from the forest to draw you in.  You\nhear the cries of a wide variety of wildlife from beyond the edge of the\ntrees, but you can't imagine what would live in such darkness.  You can't,\nthat's for sure . . . you might as well turn around and head back.\n~\nE\nhandle~\nThe handle is too deep in the bush to see.  Perhaps if you opened\nthe bush . . . \n~\nE\nmetal inside~\nThere appears to be a fence inside the bush.  As you investigate further,\nyou notice that the bush gives slightly under your weight.  You feel what\ncould be a handle of some sort . . .\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nAt first glance, the bush appears to be dying.  The leaves have all\ndried out, and the whole thing seems to almost sway and flap in the wind\n . . . almost as if it were hanging.  You see the faint glint of sunlight\nstriking metal deep inside.\n~\nS\n#17253\nThe hidden hut.~\nYou've gained entrance to a hut hidden within the underbrush at the\nedge of the forest.  It is constructed primarily of sod, and has the feel\nof an igloo--but it obviously wasn't built for comfort.  It is clearly\na temporary hideout of some sort, and amenities aren't apparently a\npriority to the owner.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17252\nE\ndown floor~\nSomeone has made an effort to at least pack the dirt on the ground into\nsomething resembling a floor.  Grass still grows in places, but it isn't\ndoing well in the absence of sunlight.\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nFrom the inside, you can see that someone has simply uprooted an\nentire bush and built a wire door frame through the middle.  The bush\nthen hangs from the frame, and from the outside, appears to still be\nhappily anchored in the soil.  You admire the genius that came up with\nthis idea.\n~\nE\n~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\nup branches vines~\nThe branches and vines that form the ceiling provide an interesting\nmaze at which to stare while you lie on your back awaiting sleep.\n~\nE\nwalls west south north sod~\nThe sod was cut from the ground and stacked into piles about 8 feet in\nheight.  A series of branches were added across the top of the room, and\nvines were allowed to grow across them as a \"roof\".  Not exactly the\nbuilding materials you'd choose for a honeymoon suite, but they serve\ntheir current purpose well . . . finding and getting into this hut is\ncertainly a challenge.\n~\nS\n#17254\nA path in the forest.~\nThe forest deepens to the west, and appears nearly impassable.  The trail\ncontinues in that direction though, as well as returning to the east.  The\nvegetation presses in from the north and south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17200\nS\n#17255\nA path through the forest.~\nThe path leads west from here, directly into the heart of the darkest\npart of the forest.  You notice an odd \"stillness\" about the trail in\nthat direction.  The forest pushes in from the south and east, preventing\npassage in those directions altogether.  To the north, the forest thins\nconsiderably.\n~\n0 0 3\nH 200 M 200\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17256\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17254\nE\nsouth east forest vegetation~\nYou note that the trees are becoming larger and older as you move to\nthe west.  Thick underbrush and massive vines block passage to the south\nand east, forcing the trail to turn to the west and north.\n~\nE\nup~\nBeams of sunlight burst through the canopy above, giving the forest about\nyou an eerie glow.  You can see that as you move west, the light disappears\ncompletely, and to the east the forest appears to be thinner.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail turns north and west here, forced to change course by the\nthickening underbrush.\n~\nS\n#17256\nThe path into the forest.~\nThe forest rises in a thick wall to the west.  Large vines and thick\nunderbrush provide an eerie backdrop to the deepeing darkness in that\ndirection.  The trail continues south, plunging into the edge of the\ndeeper woods, and to the east leads to a crossroads.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 3510\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nE\nnorth west vines underbrush forest~\nWhile the forest to the east is relatively clear, the forest to the\nwest is a mass of vegetation.  Thick, dark tree trunks rise far above you\nand squeak with a menacing tone as they sway in wind.  Large vines and\nbrambles grow between them, creating an impenetrable mass.  You can't\nimagine what kind of creatures would make their homes here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest seems to lean over you from the west, almost as it if plans\nto engulf you as a lunchtime snack.  The sun still finds the occasional\nhole to poke through here, but you can see it's having much better luck\nto the east.  Perhaps you would too . . ..\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail thins as it enters the forest to the south, but the hard-\npacked dirt suggests that it does, in fact, get travelled.

Brambles\nand briars wait patiently to shred your soft flesh.

It does look like the trail continues, but you can't tell\njust how far . . .\n~\nE\nsouth~\nYou can't see more than three feet into the bushes to the south.\nPassage would be impossible.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nThe undergrowth to the north is far too dense to allow passage.\n~\nE\nundergrowth briars brambles bush~\nThe vegetation ahead is covered with large thorns.  Patches of cloth,\nfur, and what appears to be human hair hang randomly--remnants left\nunwillingly by previous adventurers, no doubt.  You don't see how you\ncould possibly get through without snagging your own clothes.\n~\nE\nup trees~\nSquirrels play in the canopy above you.  You can see the sky through\nthe trees to the east, but the canopy to the west is dark and ominous.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail leads to the east and west.  Though the forest around you is\ndamp, the ground is surprisingly dry.\n~\nS\n#17201\nThe thick undergrowth.~\nYou step into the brush and darkness surrounds you.  The sound of a\nrabbit bolting across the trail just ahead startles you, and as you jump\na large thorn scrapes your neck.  You quickly decide you don't like this\nplace much at all.  A large hedge blocks your path to the west, and it\nappears the undergrowth thins to the east.

You can't see far enough into\nthe darkness to determine what might lie ahead.\n~\nE\nthorns briars brambles undergrowth~\nThe brambles surround you, blocking all light.  Movement in any\ndirection is sure to get you snagged.\n~\nE\nhedge~\nThe trail clearly leads into the hedge--it just vanishes . . ..  There\nappears to be a small gap in the hedge, perhaps if you open it further\nyou could squeeze through to the other side.\n~\nE\nwest~\nA large hedge rises from the brambles and blocks the path to the west.\nYou spot a piece of cloth stuck to the branches, and it looks as if\nsomeone tried to squeeze through.  You may want to look at the hedge\na little closer . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy above you blocks all sunlight.  You can neither see nor hear\nsigns of life in this part of the forest.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe trail seems to come right out of the hedge to the west, and you can\njust make out it's course to the east through the brambles.\n~\nS\n#17202\nThe entrance to Shadowvale.~\nYou stand at the entrance to a shanty-town hidden within the woods.  The\ntrail leads west, serving as a makeshift street that winds between the\nhastily-constructed shacks that line each side to the north and south.\nThis is clearly where those not welcome within the walls of Midgaard\nmake their home.  The \"street\" looks empty to the west, and a large\nhedge blocks the path to the east.  To the south a lean-to has been\nconstructed among the trees, and a shack lies to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor skimpy~\n16387 0 17204\nD1\nExit ~\nhedge door east secret~\n16387 0 17201\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17203\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nE\neast~\nA large hedge cuts across the path, marking the edge of a denser section\nof forest.  The path disappears into the hedge.  Closer examination\nmight reveal a way to get through.\n~\nE\ndown~\nYou had better tie that bootlace before going on . . . .\n~\nE\nhedge~\nThe hedge seems to mark the barrier between the grove and the deeper\nforest beyond.  The trail leads right into the hedge, and upon closer\ninspection you note a small opening.  If you could open the hedge just\na little farther, you could squeeze through to the other side.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy overhead thins as it nears the center of town.  It's almost\nas if this were a hidden oasis tucked deep within the forest.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is constructed from old and weather-worn planks, most of which\nwere probably stolen from other structures.  A skimpy door covers the\nentrance.\n~\nE\nlean-to~\nTo the south, a lean-to has been constructed among the trees.  It appears\nto be made of nothing but branches, but it blends into the surrounding\nvegetation so well it is difficult to tell from here.\n~\nS\n#17203\nA lean-to in the woods.~\nThe lean-to has been constructed from bundles of branches lashed to a\ncross-support, which in turn has been secured to two trees.  The \"roof\"\nslopes down toward the southeast corner and is open to the north, where\na small footpath leads back to the trail.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17202\nE\neast west walls vegetation~\nThe lean-to has no walls as such, though a number of vines have draped \nover the roof to provide some protection from the wind.\n~\nE\nroof up~\nThe \"roof\" is nothing but dead branches tied into bundles with vines and\npiled deep enough across the supporting branch to provide shelter from the\nelements.  Not much, but you can tell it's probably effective.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the lean-to is nothing but soft grass.  There is a large\nindentation toward the back--obviously where someone has been sleeping on\na regular basis of late.\n~\nS\n#17204\nA large shack.~\nThe shack is constructed of weathered planks, obviously salvaged from\nother buildings.  Vines and branches from the forest outside poke through\nthe occasional gaps in the walls, but the shack seems to be holding up\nwell.

What gaps\nwere left have long ago been covered by the vegetation of the dense forest\noutside.  Other than some interesting construction work, there is little\nelse of interest on the walls.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe dirt floor is clean, but doesn't look very comfortable.  It would\nprovide a dry place to rest, though.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling has been constructed of the same planks as the walls.  \nThough originally full of gaps and holes, the vegetation overgrowing the\nshack has made the roof neatly watertight.\n~\nE\nskimpy door~\nThe door consists of several thin boards nailed to some branches for\nsupport.  It appears to work like any other door . . ..\n~\nS\n#17205\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail continues toward the heart of the village.  A poorly-built\nshack lies to the north, while a more durable stone hut lies to the south.\nThe buildings continue along the trail ahead to what looks like a\ncrossroads or village square, and the trail leads back east to the dense\nforest.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17206\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17202\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door is made of hardwood planks and sturdy supports.  It would be\na tough one to break down . . . you might want to try just opening it.\n~\nE\nstone hut~\nThe hut to the south is constructed of solid stone walls with a proper,\nand well-maintained, thatch roof.  A solid wood door sits in the wall\ndirectly to your south, and the hut seems to continue to the west, where\nyou spot a window.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail continues through the trees, which are now thinning enough\nfor you to see that it leads to the west through town, and perhaps even\nwidens a little as it goes.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is a poor effort at shelter, and seems to consist of nothing\nmore than boards and branches tied to trees.  A small opening at the front\nserves as a door.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nYou'd have to go farther to the west to look into the window.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy continues to thin as you approach the center of town, and you\ncan tell that it eventually fades to the west.  You see bright shafts of\nsunlight breaking through the canopy in that direction, and the town\nlooks a lot less gloomy.\n~\nS\n#17206\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more that planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.  You might want to use the door to the south to get back on the\ntrail and out of harm's way.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nE\nwalls north east west planks~\nThe planks used to \"make\" the walls vary in size.  They also vary in\ncolor, shape and the means by which they are held together.  It's quite\nthe menagerie of construction methods.  You get the impression that a\nlot of the credit for the fact that the structure is still standing\nshould go to the vines outside, whose roots wrap tightly around anything\nexposed to the outside.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17207\nA large stone hut.~\nThe interior of the hut is dark and damp.  The stone walls are bare on the\ninside, and except for several mats on the floor there is nothing in the\nroom.  You hear voices to the west, and can see from the flickering light\naround the edges of the curtain hanging in the doorway that a fire is\nburning there.  The smell of cooking meat tempts you, but you can also\ngo through the door to the north and get on the main trail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17209\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door to the outside is made of sturdy hardwood planks.  It provides\ngood security, and, unlike most of the doors in this town, seems to have\nactually been made for the doorway it inhabits.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn of clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\ndown floor mat~\nSeveral worn reed mats lie about the floor, apparently serving as beds\nfor the current residents of the hut.\n~\nE\nroof ceiling thatch~\nLarge bundles of reeds, tied with vines, have been piled across a\ncarefully planned set of cross-supports.  This roof surely has no\nproblems with leaks.\n~\nE\nwalls south east stone~\nThe walls are constructed of square limestone blocks, obviously cut\ncarefully to fit.  You're surprised at the effort that went into them,\nand wonder if this building wasn't meant to be something more.\n~\nS\n#17208\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail approaches a small crossroads to the west, and what looks like\nit might be a fountain sits in the midst of the path in that direction.\nTo the east, the trail continues to the forest at the edge of town.  To the\nnorth is a stone building which appears to be a store of some sort, and\nto the south lies a stone hut.  The entrance to the hut is to the east,\nthough the window in front of you seems as if it might allow you to see\ninside.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17210\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nE\nletter sign~\nThe letters are difficult to make out, but with some effort, you can see\nthat the sign reads:  Blacksmith.\n~\nE\nbuilding store~\nThe building to the north looks to be a storefront, though it is in\ngreat disrepair.  The door covering the entrance is old, but appears as\nif it might still work.  As you get closer, you notice the presence of\nfaint lettering painted above the door.\n~\nE\nsouth hut~\nThe walls of the hut are in good shape, and the thick thatch roof\nsuggests some work has been done to keep this building up.  There is a door\ndown the trail to the east which seems to lead inside, and a window set\ninto the wall in front of you.  You think you see the flicker of flames\nthrough the window, but you can't be sure.\n~\nE\ndoor old~\nThe door is worn and weathered, and the hinges a bit rusty, but it\nseems likely you could still open it.\n~\nE\nup trees~\nThe sun fights its way through the boughs above and, when the branches\nget blown just the right way in the wind, the occasional warm ray of light\nreaches your face.  The canopy shows more signs of life as you move farther\nfrom the dense forests to the east.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here, and straightens out as the trees thin.  \nThe ground is a bit wet, which you attribute to the leaky fountain to the\nwest.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is very dirty, but you can make out a dimly-lit room inside\nthe hut.  There seems to be a door on the west side of the room, and\nanother on the east.  The flickering of a small fire draws your attention\nto a small hearth set into the wall.  You aren't sure, but there appears\nto be movement in the shadows.\n~\nS\n#17209\nThe kitchen of a stone hut.~\nThe kitchen of this hut is rather crude, but certainly effective.  A\nsmall hearth is set into the wall, with a variety of racks for hanging\npots and kettles.  A long countertop runs along the opposite wall, with\na series of bins for food storage beneath.  You imagine this building\nmight have once been a small cafe.  A curtain covers the entrance to the\nadjoining room to the east, and another door leads to the west.  A window\nset into the north wall admits just enough light to let you look around.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17214\nE\nsouth wall~\nThe stone walls appear to have once been carefully cut to fit.  Recent\nabuse, most likely in the form of clubs, swords and heads being bashed\ninto them, has seriously altered their appearance.  They're pitted all\nover, and large chunks are missing in several places.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof of the hut is very sturdy, and probably does a nice job of\nkeeping the place dry.\n~\nE\nwindow north~\nThrough the dirty window you can just make out the trail running east\nand west through town to the north of the hut.  Across the street you\nsee another stone building.\n~\nE\ngroove gouge~\nThe gouges look to have been made from stuff being thrown into, or at,\nthe box on a regular basis.  Maybe the stockboy wasn't too careful.\n~\nE\nbox bin~\nThe wooden box shows signs of wear, and has a number of grooves and\ngouges, both inside and out.  It is currently empty, however.\n~\nE\ncountertop~\nThe countertop is constructed of thick planking laid across a frame\nof sturdy posts.  It runs the full length of the wall, and a box has\nbeen built beneath it to serve as a storage bin.\n~\nE\nfire hearth~\nA small fire is burning in the hearth, started perhaps to prepare this\nevening's dinner.  Unfortunately, you don't see dinner itself anywhere.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn from clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\nrack pots kettle~\nA crude iron rack hangs above the fire awaiting a pot to hold over the\nfire.  The pots and kettles appear to be clean and usable, but are empty.\nApparently what you smelled from next door was yesterday's leftovers.\n~\nS\n#17210\nBennie's Blacksmith Shop.~\nYou've entered the interior of what was once clearly a blacksmith shop.\nA large hearth sits in the center of the room, providing access from\nall sides.  Rotted shelves line the walls, and a pair of tongs and a\nbillows lie rotting on the countertop.  Though the place might of once\nbeen quite busy, it appears that its better days are long past.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17208\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17212\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is slowly being overtaken by grass.  You attribute the deep\ndepression near the sliding door to the presence of horses once passing\nin and out for shoeing.  Other than this, the floor is bare--long ago\nvictim to the local scavangers.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nShafts of light pierce the weakened roof in many places, suggesting that\nthis building probably isn't very dry in the rain.  The light casts a dim\naura about the room.\n~\nE\nsliding door~\nThe sliding door to the west provides a wide berth to the street when\nopen.  It would appear that this is where Bennie once brought local\nhorses in and out of the building for shoeing.\n~\nE\neast wall~\nThe remains of a long countertop and storage shelves line the east wall.\n~\nE\nhearth~\nA circular hearth sits in the center of the room, built upon a stone\nfoundation.  The interior shows the scars of many fires, and the large\nchunks of rock missing around the edges suggest that perhaps it has\nbeen hit with a hammer repeatedly in the past.  The remains of several\nsmall fires sit in the bottom of the hearth, but you can tell it has\nbeen some time since it hosted a real blacksmith's furnace.\n~\nE\ncounter countertop~\nAt one time, a long countertop served as a workspace, running the entire\nlength of the east wall.  Like the shelves above it, though, it has been\nstripped of all useful pieces, and consists now of nothing more than a\nrotting frame.\n~\nE\nshelf shelves~\nLong, sturdy shelves at one time covered most of the interior walls in this\nbuilding, providing a massive amount of storage space.  Most of the wood\nhas long ago rotted or been removed for use elsewhere in town, though, and\nnot much remains but the frames.\n~\nE\nbillows~\nThere's not much left of the billows but the wooden frame.  It looks\nas though a leather \"bag\" for holding air might once have been attached,\nbut it has long ago rotted.  The only thing these would be useful for\nnow would be the wood scraps.\n~\nE\ntongs~\nThe tongs are old and rusted, and show the wear and tear of being thrusted\ninto the scorching flames time and time again.  Unfortunately, they aren't\nin any condition to salvage.\n~\nS\n#17211\nCrossroads at the center of town.~\nYou stand at the center of town, where the trail forms a sort of a\ncrossroad.  To the north you see a \"street\" that ends in a dead end.  The\nbuildings along each side appear to be nicer than those in the rest of\ntown.  The trail continues east and west through town, and another\nleads south, running between more buildings before it eventually leaves\ntown.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nE\ntrail~\nThe trail continues east and west to the edges of town at least.  To the\nsouth it widens a bit and appears to eventually become a road.\n~\nE\nstreet~\nThe street runs north and comes to an end at a building.  Other\nbuildings line the east and west sides.  It looks a little more promising\nthan the rest of town, and perhaps like it might have been the first\npart of town constructed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy has thinned considerably, and you can see now that the forest\nthins overhead to the west and the south.  Sunlight sneaks through in\nplaces, casting an eerie light over this part of Shadowvale.\n~\nE\ndown mud~\nYuck.  The mud has covered your boots, and you can feel the water seeping\ninto your socks . . ..\n~\nS\n#17212\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to a dead end at the wall of a stone\nbuilding several doors down.  This section of town looks somewhat more\npermanent than the rest, and the buildings are all of stone.  A wooden\ndoor leads to the building to the west, and a large sliding door provides\naccess to the stone building to the east.  To the south lies the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17210\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17217\nE\nslinding door~\nThe large wooden door hangs from a metal rail, and slides to one side\nto provide access to the building.  It would appear to be some sort\nof loading dock, or perhaps a stable door.\n~\nE\nwest structure~\nFour sturdy stone walls uphold the frame of a very old building, yet\nyou can see that the roof is in serious disrepair.  Planks have been\nstripped from the windows and awnings, most likely for use elsewhere in\ntown.  The door is battered, but is closed and probably rusted shut.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy above is much lighter, and you see small patches of sky\nbetween the boughs.  The forest thickens to the east and north, hanging\ndrearily over the edges of the village.  To the south and east it thins,\nand it looks as though the sun may actually be shining through.\n~\nE\ndown trail ground~\nThe trail here is heavily travelled.  It looks like most of the traffic\nleads to the huts at the end, as weeds grow freely along the rest of the\nbuildings.\n~\nE\neast building~\nThe building to the east looks to have once been a store of some sort.\nThe door on this side of the building is large, and slides to one side.\nIt looks like it might have been a loading dock, or maybe even a small\nstable.  A hitching post runs along the side of the building.\n~\nE\npost hitching~\nA worn branch has been mounted across two posts alongside the building.\nAt one time, judging from the considerable wear, many horses were tied\nhere on a regular basis.\n~\nS\n#17213\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail wanders west from the crossroads through another section of\ntown.  The walls of the buildings to the north and south of the crossroads\nlie to each side.  Several other buildings line the trail before it\neventually leads to the edge of town.  To the east lie the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy thins the further west you go, until it eventually\ndisappears somewhere beyond the edge of town.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is still narrow and winding along this stretch of town, but\nit would appear that it widens a bit to the west.\n~\nE\nnorth south walls~\nThe buildings to each side of the trail are made of stone and allow\nno access from this side.  You note that it looks like the roof is\ncollapsing a little on the building to the north.\n~\nS\n#17214\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail passes between two stone structures as it continues north\nand south through town.  To your north lies a small crossroads, and to\nthe south the trail leads to the edge of town.  The hut to the east is\nin good shape, but a door prevents you from seeing inside.  To the west\nlies a stone shanty.  A curtain made of a thick hide is pulled tightly\nacross the doorway, and strange markings are scrawled in red along each\nside of the entrance.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17209\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17228\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here and takes on the appearance of an actual\nroad.  It looks as though this southern route gets used often--the dirt\nis well-packed and the path free from grass.\n~\nE\nmarkings red sign~\nThe markings are in a script you don't recognize, but they have a\ndecidely evil feeling about them.  You get the impression the paint used\nto make them was probably blood . . ..\n~\nE\ncurtain hide~\nThe curtain is simply the hide of a large animal, perhaps an oxen or\nwater buffalo.  It's secured from the top, and seems to be tied loosely\nat the bottom as well.  You should be able to open it, though.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy continues to thin to the south, and the forest retreats\nsomewhat behind the buildings.  It feels a lot less enclosed here.  The\nsun breaks through the trees to warm your face, and a gentle breeze blows\nfrom the south.\n~\nE\nhut~\nThe hut is a fine, stone building.  The exterior masonry is of high \nquality, and the roof is in good shape.  You note a small quantity of smoke\nwafting from the top of the chimney.\n~\nE\nshanty~\nThe shanty is built of loosely-fitted stone which appears to be more\n\"piled\" than \"fitted\".  You can see that the roof is old, but see no\nmajor holes.  It might be a good place to rest . . . if it isn't inhabited.\n~\nS\n#17215\nThe remains of a shack.~\nYou stand in the midst of a deteriorating shack.  It appears as if it was\nonce attached to the store to the south, perhaps as workspace.  Shelves\nline the stone walls, and an old anvil stands in the corner.  The wall to\nthe west is almost entirely collapsed, providing access to the trail\noutside.  To the south a door connects to the storefront.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17210\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nLittle remains of the roof but the rafters, which are now largely\nover-grown with vines.  With a little work, you could find a sheltered\ncorner to rest in.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nGrass has started to re-take the ground inside the hut.  There is still\na lot of bare ground, and it appears as though someone has been sleeping\nhere regularly.\n~\nE\nnorth east wall shelves shelf~\nSturdy shelves have been built directly into the stone walls, providing\na significant amount of storage space.  They have long been stripped of\nanything of value they might once have held, and are home to only dust\nnow.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door isn't too sturdy, and was clearly designed to be an interior\nfixture.  It appears to be in good working condition.\n~\nS\n#17216\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to an end soon at the wall of a stone hut.\nTo the south, it leads back to the center of town.  An empty doorway leads\nto the building to the west, and the wall of the building to the east has\ncollapsed, allowing you access.  The prospects look best to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17219\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17218\nE\ndown trail~\nIt doesn't look much like anyone ever stops here.  The trail is well\nworn running north and south, but weeds cover the ground to the east and\nwest.  You note a slight rise as the trail runs north.\n~\nE\nup~\nIt's amazing how fast the canopy thickens, and a dull grey has set in\nabout you.  You can see that the edge of the forst lies just beyond the\nbuildings in all directions, and you're surprised that is hasn't yet\nengulfed the whole town.\n~\nE\ncollapsed wall rubble~\nThe remains of the wall consist of large stones and mortar.  It won't\ntake much effort to climb over it.\n~\nS\n#17217\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17218\nA sturdy lean-to.~\nAll that remains of the once proud stone building that stood here is the\nfront wall.  The back wall is partially collapsed, and is now a waist-high\npile of rubble.  Some enterprising resident has constructed a roof between\nthe two walls by laying branches and reeds across a series of slim poles.\nIt's not pretty, but it's clean and looks rather comfortable.  The trail\nlies to the east.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nnorth south~\nThe walls of the neighboring building are covered with scattered vines\nand large patches of mold.  Not very attractive, but interesting . . ..\n~\nE\nbranches reed roof ceiling~\nMost of the original branches used to create the ceiling are long-dead\nand starting to rot.  The mass of vegetation from the forest beyond has\ngrown over much of it, though, and has nicely filled gaps as they formed.\n~\nE\nrubble back~\nThe pile of rubble, which consists of mostly large blocks of stone,\nstands about chest-high to a dwarf.  You'd probably have to crawl to\nactually get back to it . . . and it certainly doesn't look like it's\nworth the effort.\n~\nS\n#17219\nThe end of the dead-end street.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the wall of a large stone structure.  It's\nhard to tell for sure, but you'd guess that the building to the north is\npart of either the building to the east or west, or maybe both.  A sturdy\noak door covers the entrance of the shack to the east, and a strong, solid\niron door blocks the entrance to the hut to your west.  You can try your\nluck with either of those, or take the trail back to the south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17220\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17223\nE\nup~\nYou feel claustrophobic beneath the shadow of the overhanging trees\nalong this end of the street.  The owners of these homes obviously didn't\nchoose the location for the wealth of sunlight it offers.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail branches neatly to the left and right to the entrances of the\ntwo buildings.  It would seem that the residents use it a lot.\n~\nE\nnorth wall~\nIt's as good a wall as you've ever seen, but that's about it.  It looks\nlike someone might even be clearing the vines off of it on occasion.\n~\nE\nsturdy oak~\nThe door is made of heavy oak planks that bear the scars of many seasons.\nIt looks like it might bear the scars of a few swordfights as well.  It's\nno worse for the wear, though, and if it's locked you won't likely be\ngetting in without a key.\n~\nE\niron~\nThis huge door is constructed of solid iron, decorated with the occasional\nrivet to hold the hinges and latch.  Considering that it's attached to a\nwindowless stone building, you imagine it might once have been a bank or\nsome other important structure.\n~\nS\n#17220\nLiving room of a small house.~\nYou can see, now that you are inside, that this shack is actually more\nof a home.  Sparse furnishings litter the room, and a picture hangs on the\nwall above a small fireplace.  It's actually rather cozy.  The front\ndoor leads back to the trail, and another door leads north to an adjoining\nroom.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17221\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17219\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nThis house has a proper roof, with relatively new planking serving to\nkeep the elements at bay.  You venture a guess that someone probably\nlives here regularly.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is nothing but packed and swept dirt, but it has aged well\nand is very clean.  You're surprised, in fact, at how clean this whole\nplace is.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls of cut stone are clean and free of the mold you see growing\non other buildings in Shadowvale.  The more you look it over, the more\nyou like this place.\n~\nE\npicture~\nA drawing of an ugly giant in a crude wood frame hangs slightly askew\non the wall.  The inscription below reads \"Brutus\".  You wonder if it's\ntrue that a mother always thinks her child is cute . . . and, if so, just\nwhat Brutus' mother might look like . . ..\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nA small stone hearth set into the stone wall flickers brightly from the\nsmall fire within.  The rack inside suggests it might also be used for\ncooking as well.\n~\nS\n#17221\nBrutus' Guest Room.~\nThis room is nicely furnished with a bed, a small nightstand and a desk.\nAgain, it is spotless.  You realize now that this is probably the guest\nquarters for the larger house across the street to the west.  This looks\nlike it would be a nice place to rest, or the door to the south will\ntake you back to the living room.\n~\n0 D 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17220\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof in this room is the same as that in the adjoining room, and it\nseems to be connected to the building next door.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor here is well-kept as well.  A nice rug made from the skin of\nsome unknown animal lies alongside the bed, and there's not a dust ball\nto be found.\n~\nE\nbed~\nThe bed is nothing but a simple cot, but it looks plenty comfortable.\n~\nE\nrug skin~\nThe hide is a dark black in color, with thick, coarse hair.  If pressed\nfor an answer, you'd guess it was from a large bear.\n~\nE\nnight stand table~\nA small wooden table serves as a nightstand next to the bed.  An oil\nlamp, built into the center of the table, provides light for the room.\n~\nE\noil lamp~\nIt's a very simple lamp, but it's unique in that it's somehow fixed\nto the table.  It's much to awkward to be of use anywhere else, and\nserves its purpose here very well.\n~\nE\nwalls north west east~\nThe stone walls are almost polished from constant brushing and cleaning.\nYou're impressed at the effort put into the upkeep of this place,\nespecially when you consider the neighborhood.\n~\nS\n#17222\nInside Windrunner's Crystal Ball~\nYou find yourself suspended in the air amidst a kaleidoscope of swirling\nmist.  After a moment, you realize you have been transferred to the inside\nof Windrunner's Crystal Ball--where he puts imputent mortals he needs to\nattend to . . ..  You feel it would be best to wait and see what he wants.\n~\n0 CDKNT 9\nO windrunner~\nE\nmist swirling~\nThe mist swirls about you in a fantastic variety of colors.  You find the\neffect almost mesmerizing.\n~\nS\n#17223\nThe entrance to Brutus' house.~\nYou've entered a small room that serves as the foyer for a rather\nlarge hut.  Actually, it's almost a house.  Several pairs of boots\nare lined neatly along the wall, and above them a series of hooks\nwait patiently for someone to hang a coat on them.  Other than this, the\nroom is bare.  You hear voices coming from the adjoining room to the\nnorth, and an iron door leads east.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17224\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17219\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe sturdy roof is constructed of heavy planking across a timber frame.\nFrom the looks of it, this house was built to endure.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor, though generally free of debris, is a bit muddy.  You hope it\ndoesn't mess up your nice boots.\n~\nE\nwest south wall~\nThe walls are made of large stone blocks, cut to fit tightly.  They are\nworn smooth with age, but remain sturdy.  Spikes have been driven into\nthem in various places to serve as hangers.\n~\nE\nspike hanger~\nIt's your basic metal spike . . . and it's driven securely into the wall.\n~\nE\niron door~\nThe heavy iron door looks a lot less imposing from the inside than it\ndid from the trail.  In fact, you're guessing it isn't solid at all, and\nis probably just a facade to fool the local \"wildlife\".\n~\nE\nboots~\nThe boots are smelly and worn, and you decide quickly you don't really\nwant to examine them further . . . ..\n~\nS\n#17224\nBrutus' Waiting Room.~\nYou are in what appears to be a waiting room, or perhaps a common room,\nfor the larger house about you.  The room is bare except for three logs\nthat serve as chairs and a picture on the wall.  A torch affixed to the\nwall provides enough light for you to see back into the entryway to the\nsouth, but, strangely, you see no other doors.  You could have sworn that\nfrom the outside this place looked a lot bigger . . ..\n  Maybe you were wrong.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17225\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17223\nE\ntorch~\nIt's a simple torch, and it's secured to the wall . . . .\n~\nE\npicture~\nA charcoal sketch of a giant, who appears to be a thief, adorns the\neast wall.  It's not life-size, but it's at least four feet in height.\nThe word \"Brutus\" is written along the bottom of the sketch.  You're\ncertain that Brutus isn't the type of guy you'd want to invite to your\nMom's house for dinner . . ..\n~\nE\nwest north wall~\nThe walls, though clean, are unadorned.  Someone must have figured they\nwere working hard enough just holding up the ceiling.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling in this room takes on a slight A-Frame appearance.  You\njudge from its construction that this room was built sometime before,\nand in a much better fashion, than the entryway to the south.\n~\nS\n#17225\nBrutus' bedroom.~\nYou've entered Brutus' private sanctuary.  A small desk sits in the corner,\nand is covered in slips of paper and ledgers.  Apparently Brutus is the\nhead honcho in these parts.  A bedroll is unrolled in front of the hearth,\nwhere a small fire warms the room.  You can exit to the west through the\nsecret door, or another door will take you north.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17226\nD3\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17224\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16451 0 11185\nE\nsecret picture~\nTo the west a hole has been roughly hewn into the wall, and you can see\nthat it's been covered with a crudely fashion door to which the picture\nwas then mounted.  Very ingenious.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt is clean, except for small piles of wood\nscraps around the hearth.  The bedroll occupies a corner of the room.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is constructed of spaced planks with wood shingles laid over\nthem.  It would seem that this isn't the orginal roof, and that perhaps\nBrutus had some work done recently.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls are made of stone and mortar.  They're discolored with age,\nbut basically in good shape.\n~\nE\nbedroll~\nThe bedroll is nothing but an old, ratty blanket, and you imagine it's\nprobably the source fo the horrible smell in the room.\n~\nE\nhearth fire~\nA small hearth is set into the wall, and a fire has recently been started.\nIt looks like Brutus was settling in for the evening.\n~\nE\nslips paper ledger~\nSeveral slips marked \"I.O.U.\" lay scattered about a large ledger.  In it\nBrutus seems to be tracking his income.  It looks like he's not only\ntrafficking in stolen merchandise, but collecting \"taxes\" from the local\nresidents as well.  From what you know about numbers, Brutus appears to\nbe doing very nicely for himself.\n~\nE\ndesk~\nIt's a small, simple desk.  It's made of wood, with a stone top.  There\nare holes in the front where drawers used to be, but Brutus seems to have\nfound little use for them.\n~\nS\n#17226\nBrutus' closet.~\nThis small closet is where Brutus probably keeps his inventory.  Too bad\nfor you his stock seems to be depleted.  The door to the south takes you\nback to the main bedroom.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17225\nD5\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17227\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling of the closet slopes steeply as it's near the edge of the\nhut.  Other than a few rope marks where someone seems to have hung something\nheavy, there's little of interest up there.\n~\nE\nnorth west east walls~\nThe closet has the same stone walls as the rest of the hut . . . what\ndid you expect?\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the closet isn't as clean as the floor of the room outside.\nIn fact, it looks a bit like the dirt has been recently disturbed . . ..\n~\nS\n#17227\nBrutus' secret storage room.~\nThat Brutus, he's a pretty smart guy.  The room has been dug beneath\nthe closet, and is rather crude.  It's big enough to store quite a bit\nof illegal merchandise in, though--even if it doesn't stay very clean.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD4\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17226\nE\nnorth south east west down walls dirt~\nThe walls are dirt, and they aren't very well-supported.  Little bits\nhave caved in here and there, and in several spots it looks like sharp\nweapons, maybe spears, were stuck into the walls for storage.  You wonder\nhow many good rains it will take until this whole end of the house sinks\ninto the ground.\n~\nE\nup secret~\nYou can see from below that the secret door is made from thick planks,\nand is laid across the top of the hole.  Brutus made it thick enough to\nseem real when he closed it and spread the dirt over it--but he just\nain't as smart as you, is he?\n~\nS\n#17228\nThe Cleric's Shanty.~\nThe small altar in the corner suggests that this shack is the home of\nthe local priest.  Other than the altar and a small cot, the room is bare\nof furnishings and possessions.  The door to the east leads back to the\ntrail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17214\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt shows a worn path from the door to the altar.\nIt would seem many have made that particular walk.  It would also seem\nthat they have tracked all sorts of dirt and other gross things in with\nthem.  You can see why the priest made the cot.\n~\nE\ncot bed~\nA simple cot, consisting of a board laid across to pieces of firewood,\nsits in the corner of the shack.  It looks really uncomfortable, but\nyou could see the advantages of it over, say, sleeping on the floor.\n~\nE\ndoor curtain hide~\nThe door to the shack consists of a simple hide nail to the upper\ncorners.  Apparently the priest trusts his clientele a little more\nthat you would.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is made of randomly over-laid planks.  The gaps\nare plugged with rags and other assorted materials, and the effort looks\nto be mildly successful.\n~\nE\nnorth west south walls~\nThe walls of the shack are simply planks, coated with a thin film of\nwhat looks like mud.  If it was an attempt at plaster, it was a very bad\none.  They do serve to keep the elements at bay, however . . ..\n~\nS\n#17229\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail continues north and south through Shadowvale.  To the north\nyou see a crossroads and what appears to be a fountain.  To the south,\nthe trail becomes a road out of town.  A poorly-constructed shack lies\nto your east, while a much nicer one lies to the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17230\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor flimsy~\n16387 0 17231\nE\ntrail down~\nThe trail leads north and south here, and appears to be heavily-trodden.\n~\nE\nwest shack~\nTo the west sits a nice shack that has been connected directly to the\nbuilding to the north and the ruins to the south.  A flimsy door has\nbeen set into the entrance, and a small window sits off to one side of\nthe door.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the trees above in various places, dispelling\nsome of the eerie shadows from the trees above.  This place is still\ndefinitely on the wierd side of creepy, though.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is covered in dirt.  As you wipe a spot clean, you note that\nthe curtains are drawn and you can't see in anyway.\n~\nE\ndoor flimsy~\nThe door most likely keeps out nothing but the rain.  Still, it'd be\neasier to open it than to kick it in . . ..\n~\nS\n#17230\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more than planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.  You might want to use the door to the west to get back on the\ntrail and out of harm's way.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nE\nplanks patch scrap~\nThe planks are of varying sizes and shapes, and, it would appear,\nthickness.  They are spotted with pieces of cloth, hide and anything\nelse that was available to keep out the rain.\n~\nE\nnorth east south walls~\nThe walls, such as they are, are a conglomeration of materials put\ntogether as availability and need dictated.  \"Mess\" is the first word\nthat comes to mind.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17231\nThe common shack.~\nThis well-maintained shack seems to serve as a common home to a variety\nof Shadowdale's residents.  Several bedrolls cover the floor, and gear\nof all kinds sits about the room.  You get the feeling, however, that the\nresidents wouldn't be ideal roommates . . ..  Doors lead east and west to\ninevitably safer territory.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor east flimsy~\n16387 0 17229\nD3\nExit ~\nback door west~\n16387 0 17250\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the shack consists entirely of tightly-packed dirt.  Not \nmuch, but it's a dry place to sleep.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is mostly branches woven into a tight sheet.\nYou get the feeling it probably leaks when it rains.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe doors of this shack are simply weather-worn planks tied together\nalong cross-supports.  You could probably put your fist through them if\nyou had to, but it would be easier just to open them . . .\n~\nE\nnorth south wall~\nThe walls of the shack are simple, unadorned planks, many of which seem\nto have come from other buildings . . ..\n~\nE\ngear~\nA variety of gear in states of general mis-use lie about the room.  While\nsome of it may once have been useful, it's all junk now.\n~\nE\nbed bedrolls~\nSeveral piles of hides lie scattered about the room serving as beds.\nThey look as if they are used regularly.\n~\nS\n#17232\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail winds between two more buildings before it leads south out of\ntown.  As it leaves town, the trail leads slowly down into a wide valley.\nThe trees continue to thin in that direction, and you can't be sure, but\nyou think you see the glint of sunlight reflecting off water far down in\nthe valley.  The trail leads north back into town.  To the west are the\ncharred remains of a burned-out building, and to the east a sturdy, well-\nbuilt shack.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17233\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17235\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17234\nE\nshack hut east~\nThe hut to the east is constructed mostly of stone.  \"Patches\" of planks,\nmortar, branches and vines cover holes where larger stones have broken\nloose from the foundation.  The repairs look almost as sturdy as the\nremaining foundation, if not moreso.  It's clearly an old building, but\nsomeone is making an effort to keep it well-maintained.\n  A solid oak door is set into the doorway, blocking your view inside.\n~\nE\nvine patch mortar branch~\nSomeone seems to have patched holes in the foundation of the hut with\na mixture of muddy mortar and branches.  Vines have taken root, providing\nan overlying web of flora.  The patches give the hut a very \"earthy\"\nappearance, almost like a large, moss-covered rock with a nice patch\nof sod growing on top.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is well-trodden here, and it appears many pairs of boots have\nmade the journey south.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun struggles to break through the canopy here, and it appears to\nbe having much more success to the south.  You see birds among the boughs\nof the oaks again, and the chatter of squirrels filters down from far\nabove.\n~\nE\ndoor oak plank~\nThe door to this hut has been cut from a single width of hard oak\nplanking.  It looks very secure, which is good, but rare, in this\nneighborhood.  If it's locked, it would probably be easier to cut a\nhole in the wall than to break it down.\n~\nS\n#17233\nA well-built hut.~\nYou have entered a very comfortable shack.  Though the only furniture\nis a bed in one corner, the shack appears to have been recently cleaned.\nThe walls are solid, and the roof is strong enough to keep out the rain.\nWhat a wonderful place to hide away and rest.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17232\nE\noak plank~\nThe door looks as solid from the inside as it did from outside.  You\nadmire the beautiful grain of the wood . . .\n~\nE\nup~\nThe hut has a sod roof, supported by long, straight limbs culled from\nthe surrounding forest.  Someone did a very nice job of building it.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor of the hut is basically hard-packed dirt.  However, it's\npacked very well, and is almost as solid as stone.\n~\nE\nwalls east north south~\nThe walls of the hut consist of a waist-high stone foundation and smooth\nplanks above that.  They are entirely bare, and could use some decoration.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe door looks just as good inside, and is in very good shape.  If you\nwere to close it, it would probably keep unwanted characters out.\n~\nS\n#17234\nThe remains of a burned building.~\nYou stand amidst the charred ruins of what once might have been a very\nnice shack.  There certainly was a lot of wood in it, as the ashes are\nknee deep and charcoal beams still attempt to hold a roof that no longer\nexists.  You might find something if you rummage, but the place looks\nlike it's been well-scavanged.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\nvegetation forest vines~\nBranches from the forest beyond have grown through the remaining wall\nsupports, protruding into the room.  Large vines have used the branches\nto bridge their way in as well, and are slowly overtaking the area.  You\nare amazed at the resilience of the forest behind the building, and can't\neven imagine how horrible it would be to get stuck in it.\n~\nE\nashes ruins~\nDeep piles of gray ashes, matted into flat mounds by wind and rain,\nprovide an eerie backdrop for the grim black beams which rise like the\ntrees on some lost desert plain.  This place is creepy, even by local\nstandards.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest has already begun to reclaim the back wall of the house.  The\nvines have made themselves at home on the remaining wall supports, and\nhave created an impassable wall of vegetation.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nA short stone foundation survived on the southern side of the lot, \ndefiantly supporting the last remains of the only thing that can be clearly\nidentified as a wall.  Through the remains you can see that the forest\nappears to thin to the south, and you see the trail leading south into\nthe woods just in front of the building.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nThe owners of the building to the north seem to have salvaged a lot of\nthe useful materials from this site, and used them to re-build their\nsouthern wall.  They didn't do a very good job, though, and none of the\npieces fit together.  Cracks and holes appear all over.\n~\nE\nhole crack~\nYou can make out faint shapes inside the shack.  It's too dark to be\nsure, but judging from the whispering and sounds of shuffling, it sounds\nlike the residents might be home . . . and there's more than one person\nat home.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe gray ashes are a little damp, and are making a mess of your boots.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is much thinner here than at the northern edges of town, and\nthe occasional ray of sun sneaks through.  It appears that the trees\ncontinue to thin to the south.\n~\nS\n#17235\nA trail leading south out of town.~\nYou stand on the southern edge of the small village of Shadowvale.  The\ntown, which spreads out to your north, has a dark and menacing feel about\nit--even here you feel many eyes watching you.  The road continues north\ninto town, or south to the thinner forest and, eventually, foreign realms.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\ndown trail road~\nThe road is clear and well-marked as it leaves town to the south.  To\nthe north, it appears to lead into the heart of the village.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe thin forest to the west holds little of interest for you, though you\ndo see the remains of a burned-out building to the west of your trail--\nright on the edge of the approaching village.\n~\nE\neast~\nYou see a shack sitting along the east side of the road just north of here,\nmarking the entrance to a village.  The forest is just thin enough that\nyou could leave the trail without getting too horribly lost, but you see\nnothing of interest that would justify the effort.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun beams down upon you brightly as you look up to see squirrels\nplaying among the trees.  The forest is very peaceful here, but turns\ndark and ominous just to the north.\n~\nE\nsign~\n----------------\n    |  Sorry Brave   |\n    | Adventurers... |\n    |                |\n    |     The        |\n    |   Southern     |\n    |    Realms      |\n    |   Are Still    |\n    |     Under      |\n    |  Construction  |\n     ----------------\n           | |\n           | |\n~\nS\n#17236\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trees thin considerably along this stretch of the trail, and sunlight\nbeams warmly upon you.  An empty lot lies to your north, and you can see\na small grove of pine trees lying just beyond.  To your south are the\nremains of an old shack.  The trail to the west leads to the edge of town,\nand there appears to be a crossroads further into town to the east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17237\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is almost clear at this spot.  It would seem the locals have\nharvested a few trees in the surrounding area.  Mmmmm, that sun feels \ngood, eh?\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-trodden, and continues to widen to the west.\n~\nE\nsouth remains shack~\nThe shack is in major disrepair, but still standing.  It might still\nprovide shelter . . . if you can wedge yourself into a dry corner.  The\ndoorway is empty, the door long-ago stolen for some other housing project.\n~\nS\n#17237\nA campsite in an empty lot.~\nThis vacant lot has been used as a campsite so many times that it has\ntaken on a permanent appearance.  The remains of several fires are\nscattered about the site, and a pine grove that begins on the north\nend of the lot provides nice cover for sleeping.  You can go into the\ngrove to your north, or to the trail through town to the south.

You can make out a clearing to the north in the pine\ngrove, and taller weeds along the walls on each side of the lot provide\nnice protection from the wind.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest has thinned to only scattered trees, and the sun beams down\nupon the lot.  Shade can be gained under the pines to the north, and you\ncan see the forest rising above the far side of the grove.\n~\nE\neast west wall~\nA barrier of weeds and shrubs rings the lot along the edges of the\nneighboring buildings.  The walls appear to be solid and offer no access\nto the inside of either structure.\n~\nE\ncampfire fire~\nSeveral blackened circles surrounded with stones are scattered about\nthe lot.  Half-burned logs, apparently from the pine forest, lie rotting\naround the edges of each site.\n~\nS\n#17238\nA small pine grove.~\nYou have wandered into a small pine grove tucked away behind the homes\nin this area.  The underbrush has been tamed in this clearing, and the\nfresh scent of the small pines is quite refreshing.  The grove continues\nto your north and west.  To your east lies the back wall of a shack, and\nto the south a campsite.  It appears that the pine needles which litter\nthe ground would make a wonderful place to sleep.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17239\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17237\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17241\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees at the front of the grove look young and healthy, as if \nperhaps they are thinned regularly, or used for firewood.  They provide\nnice shelter for the grove, though they aren't much for climbing.\n~\nE\nwall shack east~\nThe wall of the shack is overgrown with flowery vines.  There do not\nappear to be any windows or other distinguishing features.\n~\nE\nflowery vines~\nThe vines appear to be from the morning glory family.  They cover the\nwall in thick patterns, sprouting patches of beautiful purple teacup\nshaped flowers here and there.  Insects and small birds play contentedly\nin the cover they provide.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe bed of pine needles which covers the ground is quite thick.  There\nare patches here and there where piles of needles have been gathered, most\nlikely for use in building fire.  The softness of the ground is a welcome\ntreat for your aching feet.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe boughs of the pines dance lightly in the wind overhead.  Birds and\nsquirrels ramble aimlessly among the branches searching for food.\n~\nS\n#17239\nA small pine grove.~\nThe serenity of the pine grove calms your anxieties as you venture\ndeeper within.  The heavy undergrowth of the forest once again rises to\nchoke out the pines and block passage to the north, and the back of\na house lies to your east.  The grove continues west and south . . . \nsuddenly, a loud cry captures your attention, and it appears to be coming\nfrom the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nE\npine tree~\nYou're amazed that these little trees do so well in the midst of the\ndark forest.  They can't be over 20 feet tall, and it's almost as if\nmagic protects them from the darkness around them.\n~\nE\nforest vines undergrowth~\nThe forest rises quickly above the grove, the undergrowth rising at its\nfeet to form a wall of vegetation that is clearly impassable.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe inside of the house is dimly lit, but you can clearly make out the\nshapes of two large \"men\" sitting around a table.  You make a mental note\nof the house's location so as not to accidentally wander in on them.\n~\nE\neast house shack~\nThe house to the east appears to be constructed of stone, and is in\nvery good shape.  Vines cover the back wall, but you can make out a window\nhidden behind a patch of flowers.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe soft needles here are not as nice as the ones at the entrance to\nthe grove . . . mushrooms, vines and other offshoots frmo the forest\nfight for a foothold.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy of the neighboring forest towers above the edge of the grove,\nreminding you again of the ominous nature of the entire village.  Once\nagain, life appears almost non-existent overhead . . . though you do feel\nthe odd sensation of being watched . . ..\n~\nS\n#17240\nA small pine grove.~\nThere is a small clearing in the pine forest, and a lone pine tree \nstands in the northwest corner of the grove.  As you peer intently\nup into the branches, you see a large owl's nest perched just out of\nreach.  The forest blocks passage to the north and west, and the rest\nof the pine grove lies east and south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17239\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17241\nE\nwest north forest undergrowth~\nOnce again the forest has pushed so densely against the grove that\npassage is impossible.  It looks pretty spooky anyway . . ..\n~\nE\ntree pine~\nThe pine tree stands alone in the corner of the clearing, as if holding\noff the forest by itself.  It provides a perfect perch for the owl to\nsurvey the grove, and plenty of room to swoop quickly down upon its\nunsuspecting dinner guests.\n~\nE\nnest~\nThe owl's nest looks to be about a yard in width, and is constructed\nof twigs and leaves wedged into a deep hole in the tree.  It sits just\nout of your reach . . . and the tree offers no branches for you to climb.\n~\nE\nskeleton~\nThe skeleton appears to be that of a rat, or perhaps a small cat.  It\nis about the right size for an owl's dinner.  It's best left alone.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe ground is relatively clear here--a perfect area for an owl's\nhunting grounds.  A small skeleton lies half-covered in pine needles,\nbut you see no other signs that anyone has been here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest hangs precariously above the pine grove, drowning out most\nof the light.  Besides the owl's nest, there are few signs of life here.\n~\nS\n#17241\nA small pine grove.~\nThis corner of the pine grove is very pleasant, and is by far the\nbrightest.  The forest closes in to block passage to the west, and adds\nan ominous gloom to an otherwise nice place.  The wall of a stone building\nlies to your south, and the pine grove runs to the east and north.  You\nhear a strange, hair-tingling shriek in the latter direction.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nE\ndown needles~\nThere are signs that others have been here before you.  The needles\nshow places where several others have rested, at least one of whom was\nbleeding . . . the trail of blood leads off to the north.\n~\nE\nstone wall house building~\nThe back of the house is simply a rock wall, offering no windows or\ndoors for passage.\n~\nE\nwest forest undergrowth~\nThough it appears that the forest thins a bit to the west, there's no\nway you're going to get there from here to find out.  It's almost as if\nsomeone has been encouraging the forest to form a wall . . . it's hard\nto believe it could be so consistently unpassable on it's own.\n~\nE\nbirds~\nThe birds appear to be only sparrows, and they're far out of your\nreach.  There's probably a better meal to be had somewhere else.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou spot several birds fluttering around amongst the pines, and hear\nthe distinct sounds of squirrels playing out of sight.\n~\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees provide a nice amount of cover here, and it would be a\nwonderful place to kick back and ponder the mysteries of life . . ..\n~\nS\n#17242\nThe remains of a shack.~\nThis shack has pretty much reached the end of its useful life.  The\nroof has collapsed in upon the interior, and most anything of use was\nlong ago stripped and salvaged.  You can climb across the rubble, where\na small clearing seems to sit in back of the building to the south, or\nexit to the path through town to the north.  To the east lies the exterior\nwall of a sturdy building, and to the west you see a hide-covered hut,\nbut no way to enter it.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nE\neast building wall~\nThe bare face of a stone wall forms the back of the building to the east.\nThere would appear to be no access from this side.\n~\nE\nwest hide hut~\nTo the west you can just make out what looks like an igloo made of\nanimal skins tucked within the trees.  However, you can't tell much more\nthan that from this vantage point.\n~\nE\nrubble~\nThe rubble would appear to be the remains of a rock wall which fell\nvictim to the elements some time ago.  It is now only a waist-high pile\nof rocks and boards.  You should be able to climb over it easily to get\nto the clearing beyond.\n~\nE\ndown~\nGrass and a variety of weeds have started to re-establish themselves now\nthat the shack has collapsed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees have thinned overhead, but the sun isn't at the proper angle\nto reach this particular lot.  Too bad, the grass could use some help.\n~\nS\n#17243\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYour attention is immediately drawn to the hut to the south, which appears\nto be constructed of animal hides and stands out awkwardly from the forest.\nTo your north is the stone wall of an old hut, the entrance of which lies\nfurther to the west.  The edge of town lies to your west, and the trail\neast will take you into the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17247\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\nhut hide~\nFrom the trail, it looks as though the hut is made of a large segment\nof leather pulled taught over some sort of from.  Further inspection\nmight provide more insights.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou are clearly near the western edge of the forest, as the trees become\nmuch thicker, and ominously darker, the further east you look.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-packed and dry.  It looks like many pairs of\nfeet, and in some cases multiple pairs, have used the trail recently.\n~\nE\nwall stone~\nExcept for a few small vines and some patches of fungus, the stone wall\nis bare.  You can tell from the outside that the door to this building is\nthe one just west of here.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nYou'll have to go a little farther west down the trail to see the door\nproperly.\n~\nS\n#17244\nA storage closet.~\nThe closet is very plain.  Several nails have been pounded into the\nwalls to serve as hooks, and the floor is scratched from the occasional\ntrunk that has been dragged in and out.  It is otherwise very clean\nand somewhat secure.  It's value as a hideout might outweigh its\noriginal purpose.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17245\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is simply a series of planks embedded in the ground, but it's\nlevel and dry.  It would certainly be among the cleaner places you've\nrested today . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of the hut appears to be made of planks, sealed here and there\nwith patches of sod.  It's not much, but it would likely keep you dry\nin the rain.\n~\nE\neast north south walls~\nThe walls are bare, but sturdy.\n~\nE\ndoor west~\nThe door separates the closet from the main room of the shack.  When\nclosed, it provides decent privacy.\n~\nS\n#17245\nThe Warrior's Shack.~\nYou have entered a well-kept shack that appears to belong to a warrior\nwho has taken up long-term residence in Shadowvale.  Though plain and\nunfurnished, the stone walls provide protection from the elements and,\nwell, at least the door works.  The trail through town lies to the\nsouth, and a door is set into the eastern wall.\n~\n0 D 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17244\nD2\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17246\nE\nnorth west walls~\nThe stone walls are well-constructed, and on the inside, at least, are\nin good shape.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of this shack actually has shingles, though light shows \nthrough in the corners of the room.  It's better than sleeping in the rain.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in oak planking.  It's worn, but not deteriorating.\nIt's certainly good enough to keep most of the bugs out of your bedroll.\n~\nE\ndoor east~\nThe door to the east isn't as solid as the exterior door, and appears\nto lead to a storage room or closet.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door to the outside is quite sturdy, and will definitely keep out\nwandering fidos and other undesirables.\n~\nS\n#17246\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYou stand at the western-most edge of a small village tucked within\nthe forest.  The town spreads out to the east, hidden beneath the quickly\ndarkening forest.  An air of gloom hangs over the grove, and you see\nlittle movement in the streets.  To your north lies an entrance to\na sturdy stone hut, but a wooden door blocks any view inside.  To your\nsouth is a dilapitated shack--the door is closed, but you can't imagine\nwhy anyone would bother.  The trail leaves town to your west, and leads\ninto the center of town (as well as the deeper forest) to your east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17245\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17248\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17249\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens as it leaves town to the west.  To the east, it becomes\nnarrower as it winds between the scattered buildings and trees.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is open and airy above you, and squirrels frolic among the\nboughs.  You can see that the trees slowly fade to the west, while to the\neast the canopy thickens and eventually fades into darkness.\n~\nE\nsouth shack~\nThe dilapitated shack to the south appears ready to collapse in on\nitself.  The walls are old and rotted, and large chunks of the roof\nare missing.  The well-worn path to the door suggests that someone\nis still using it regularly, despite its condition.\n~\nE\nwooden door~\nIt's a wooden door--your time would be better spent trying to open it.\n~\nE\nnorth stone hut~\nThe sturdy hut is built from cut limestone and looks to be kept up\nregularly.  You judge from the building pattern that it probably also\nextends to the east, but you see no entrance in that direction.  The\nwooden door is closed, but looks like it probably works.\n~\nS\n#17247\nA hut covered in animal hides.~\nHides have been stretched across a frame of bent branches to form a\ndomed hut among the trees.  The floor is clean and dry, and someone\nhas recently been building fires in the center of the room.  A shaft\nof sunlight pierces the hole in the roof which serves as a chimney,\nand casts a dim light about the room.  The doorway to the north leads\nback to the trail.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nstraw pile~\nIt would seem the current occupant is using the pile of straw as a bed.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt has been carefully maintained.  It is smooth\nand, except for a pile of straw in the corner, free of debris.\n~\nE\nhole up~\nYou can just make out the boughs of the trees as the wind blows them\nback and forth above the hut.  The hole is about a dagger's length\nacross--just enough to draw the smoke out, and not enough to let the\nrain in.\n~\nE\nbranches~\nThe branches appear to be taken from willow trees.  About a dozen of\nthem rise around the edge of the cirular shelter, and are tied with\ntwine where they meet at the top.\n~\nE\nhide walls skins~\nThe hides appear to be from a wide variety of animals.  Large skins,\nmost likely from wolves and bears, form the majority of the structure,\nand smaller skins have been used to fill the gaps.  Overall, the work\nis excellent.\n~\nS\n#17248\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17249\nThe trail leading out of Shadowvale.~\nThe trail leads east into a small village hidden within the edge of\nthe forest.  To the west the forest thins and eventually fades altogether.\nSquirrels and other wildlife play in the light cover near the trail, and\nyou can hear the chatter of birds in the surrounding canopy.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail looks well-travelled to the east toward town, but fades here\nand can't be seen to the west.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest thins to the west, but you can't make out the lands beyond.\nThe trail ends here, however, so there can't be too much out there . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the canopy in many places, leaving misty trails\nas it seeks out the ground below.  You notice the eerie contrast with\nthe forest to the east, which quickly becomes dark and menacing.\n~\nE\nnorth south forest~\nThe forest around you consists of random trees scattered among a low\ncovering of bushes and vines.  It has a rather cheerful feel about it,\nand you note a wide range of scents in the air.\n~\nS\n#17250\nA small clearing in the woods.~\nA small clearing has been created just behind the shacks along this\nrow.  Piles of garbage sit rotting along the edge of the forest, which\ncloses quickly in against the southern and western edges of the lot.\nThere are signs of a trail entering the underbrush to the west, but it\nis difficult to make out where it might go.  The back door of a shack\nlies to your east, and the remains of a fallen building lie north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD1\nExit ~\nback door east~\n16387 0 17231\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nE\ndown~\nThe clearing is covered in a soft, green turf.  If it weren't for the\nstink of rotting garbage, it'd be a nice place to rest for awhile.\n~\nE\nup~\nNo trees grow in the lot, and the refreshing glow of sunlight enhances\nthe area.  You can tell from the canopy though that this might be the only\nsunny spot for some distance in any direction.\n~\nE\ntrail west~\nThere appears to be a path leading into the forest at the western edge\nof the clearing, but the undergrowth is so heavy it is hard to be sure.\n~\nE\npile garbage~\nIt looks as if someone has been tossing the remains of meals, and perhaps\nworse, along the edges of this lot.  Even if there was something of value\nburied deep in there, you doubt it's worth enough to dig around and find\nit.\n~\nE\nback door east~\nThe door is simply a variety of random boards and planks tied together\nwith string and vines.  Nice effort, but certainly better at keeping\nout the wind than hearty adventurers like yourself.\n~\nS\n#17251\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail plunges into the forest, and the vegetation immediately\npresses in against you.  It appears that the trail continues south, and\nreturns east to the clearing.\n~\n0 A 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17252\nE\ndown trail~\nThe ground is covered in vegetation, and vines reach out to snag your\nfeet and armor.  The trail is faint, but after a few seconds you can\nsee that it clearly goes south, if anywhere . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest above is so thick that light can hardly penetrate.  The\nlower branches are covered in vines, and you can't see any further into\nthe forest in this direction than in any other.\n~\nE\nwest north forest underbrush~\nThe undergrowth is thick in this part of the forest.  You think the\nbacks of the buildings along the main trail should be to your north, but\nit is impossible to see more than several feet into the vegetation.\nThe trail is the only possible means of passage through this area.\n~\nS\n#17252\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the forest edge.  Vegetation presses in\nfrom the south, east and west preventing further passage.  A strange bush\nprotruding from the forest edge to the west captures your attention.\n~\n0 A 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17253\nE\ndown~\nThick sod, covered in leaves and decaying branches, covers the forest\nfloor.  You feel you should watch carefully where you are walking so\nas not to entangle yourself in the vines.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees grow low over the path, and the vines growing from the\nbranches hang just out of reach.  A wave of claustrophobia overcomes\nyou, and you feel the urge to turn and run.\n~\nE\nsouth east forest underbrush~\nThe underbrush almost reaches out from the forest to draw you in.  You\nhear the cries of a wide variety of wildlife from beyond the edge of the\ntrees, but you can't imagine what would live in such darkness.  You can't,\nthat's for sure . . . you might as well turn around and head back.\n~\nE\nhandle~\nThe handle is too deep in the bush to see.  Perhaps if you opened\nthe bush . . . \n~\nE\nmetal inside~\nThere appears to be a fence inside the bush.  As you investigate further,\nyou notice that the bush gives slightly under your weight.  You feel what\ncould be a handle of some sort . . .\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nAt first glance, the bush appears to be dying.  The leaves have all\ndried out, and the whole thing seems to almost sway and flap in the wind\n . . . almost as if it were hanging.  You see the faint glint of sunlight\nstriking metal deep inside.\n~\nS\n#17253\nThe hidden hut.~\nYou've gained entrance to a hut hidden within the underbrush at the\nedge of the forest.  It is constructed primarily of sod, and has the feel\nof an igloo--but it obviously wasn't built for comfort.  It is clearly\na temporary hideout of some sort, and amenities aren't apparently a\npriority to the owner.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17252\nE\ndown floor~\nSomeone has made an effort to at least pack the dirt on the ground into\nsomething resembling a floor.  Grass still grows in places, but it isn't\ndoing well in the absence of sunlight.\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nFrom the inside, you can see that someone has simply uprooted an\nentire bush and built a wire door frame through the middle.  The bush\nthen hangs from the frame, and from the outside, appears to still be\nhappily anchored in the soil.  You admire the genius that came up with\nthis idea.\n~\nE\n~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\nup branches vines~\nThe branches and vines that form the ceiling provide an interesting\nmaze at which to stare while you lie on your back awaiting sleep.\n~\nE\nwalls west south north sod~\nThe sod was cut from the ground and stacked into piles about 8 feet in\nheight.  A series of branches were added across the top of the room, and\nvines were allowed to grow across them as a \"roof\".  Not exactly the\nbuilding materials you'd choose for a honeymoon suite, but they serve\ntheir current purpose well . . . finding and getting into this hut is\ncertainly a challenge.\n~\nS\n#17254\nA path in the forest.~\nThe forest deepens to the west, and appears nearly impassable.  The trail\ncontinues in that direction though, as well as returning to the east.  The\nvegetation presses in from the north and south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17200\nS\n#17255\nA path through the forest.~\nThe path leads west from here, directly into the heart of the darkest\npart of the forest.  You notice an odd \"stillness\" about the trail in\nthat direction.  The forest pushes in from the south and east, preventing\npassage in those directions altogether.  To the north, the forest thins\nconsiderably.\n~\n0 0 3\nH 200 M 200\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17256\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17254\nE\nsouth east forest vegetation~\nYou note that the trees are becoming larger and older as you move to\nthe west.  Thick underbrush and massive vines block passage to the south\nand east, forcing the trail to turn to the west and north.\n~\nE\nup~\nBeams of sunlight burst through the canopy above, giving the forest about\nyou an eerie glow.  You can see that as you move west, the light disappears\ncompletely, and to the east the forest appears to be thinner.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail turns north and west here, forced to change course by the\nthickening underbrush.\n~\nS\n#17256\nThe path into the forest.~\nThe forest rises in a thick wall to the west.  Large vines and thick\nunderbrush provide an eerie backdrop to the deepeing darkness in that\ndirection.  The trail continues south, plunging into the edge of the\ndeeper woods, and to the east leads to a crossroads.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 3510\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nE\nnorth west vines underbrush forest~\nWhile the forest to the east is relatively clear, the forest to the\nwest is a mass of vegetation.  Thick, dark tree trunks rise far above you\nand squeak with a menacing tone as they sway in wind.  Large vines and\nbrambles grow between them, creating an impenetrable mass.  You can't\nimagine what kind of creatures would make their homes here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest seems to lean over you from the west, almost as it if plans\nto engulf you as a lunchtime snack.  The sun still finds the occasional\nhole to poke through here, but you can see it's having much better luck\nto the east.  Perhaps you would too . . ..\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail thins as it enters the forest to the south, but the hard-\npacked dirt suggests that it does, in fact, get travelled.  To the east\nthe trail leads to a crossroads.\n~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 17204   1 17204  1\t* The mimic\nM 0 17200   2 17205  1\t* the mangy fido\nG 1 3068  -1     \t*   a pair of hard leather

The trail appears\npassable, but it's going to hurt . . .\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17254\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17201\nE\neast~\nYou can just make out a crossroads down the trail to the east.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe idea of plunging into this mass of vines and vegetation isn't very\nappealing.  It does look like the trail continues, but you can't tell\njust how far . . .\n~\nE\nsouth~\nYou can't see more than three feet into the bushes to the south.\nPassage would be impossible.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nThe undergrowth to the north is far too dense to allow passage.\n~\nE\nundergrowth briars brambles bush~\nThe vegetation ahead is covered with large thorns.  Patches of cloth,\nfur, and what appears to be human hair hang randomly--remnants left\nunwillingly by previous adventurers, no doubt.  You don't see how you\ncould possibly get through without snagging your own clothes.\n~\nE\nup trees~\nSquirrels play in the canopy above you.  You can see the sky through\nthe trees to the east, but the canopy to the west is dark and ominous.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail leads to the east and west.  Though the forest around you is\ndamp, the ground is surprisingly dry.\n~\nS\n#17201\nThe thick undergrowth.~\nYou step into the brush and darkness surrounds you.  The sound of a\nrabbit bolting across the trail just ahead startles you, and as you jump\na large thorn scrapes your neck.  You quickly decide you don't like this\nplace much at all.  A large hedge blocks your path to the west, and it\nappears the undergrowth thins to the east.  You can't tell what lies\nto the north and south . . .\n~\n0 ACN 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17200\nD3\nExit ~\nhedge door west secret~\n16387 0 17202\nE\neast~\nThe trail looks clear a little farther to the east.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nA series of vines seem to have established itself to the north.\nCutting a path through them would be difficult, but it might be\npossible.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nThe undergrowth looks just as bad to the south, and there are no signs\nat all of a path in that direction.  You can't see far enough into\nthe darkness to determine what might lie ahead.\n~\nE\nthorns briars brambles undergrowth~\nThe brambles surround you, blocking all light.  Movement in any\ndirection is sure to get you snagged.\n~\nE\nhedge~\nThe trail clearly leads into the hedge--it just vanishes . . ..  There\nappears to be a small gap in the hedge, perhaps if you open it further\nyou could squeeze through to the other side.\n~\nE\nwest~\nA large hedge rises from the brambles and blocks the path to the west.\nYou spot a piece of cloth stuck to the branches, and it looks as if\nsomeone tried to squeeze through.  You may want to look at the hedge\na little closer . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy above you blocks all sunlight.  You can neither see nor hear\nsigns of life in this part of the forest.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe trail seems to come right out of the hedge to the west, and you can\njust make out it's course to the east through the brambles.\n~\nS\n#17202\nThe entrance to Shadowvale.~\nYou stand at the entrance to a shanty-town hidden within the woods.  The\ntrail leads west, serving as a makeshift street that winds between the\nhastily-constructed shacks that line each side to the north and south.\nThis is clearly where those not welcome within the walls of Midgaard\nmake their home.  The \"street\" looks empty to the west, and a large\nhedge blocks the path to the east.  To the south a lean-to has been\nconstructed among the trees, and a shack lies to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor skimpy~\n16387 0 17204\nD1\nExit ~\nhedge door east secret~\n16387 0 17201\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17203\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nE\neast~\nA large hedge cuts across the path, marking the edge of a denser section\nof forest.  The path disappears into the hedge.  Closer examination\nmight reveal a way to get through.\n~\nE\ndown~\nYou had better tie that bootlace before going on . . . .\n~\nE\nhedge~\nThe hedge seems to mark the barrier between the grove and the deeper\nforest beyond.  The trail leads right into the hedge, and upon closer\ninspection you note a small opening.  If you could open the hedge just\na little farther, you could squeeze through to the other side.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy overhead thins as it nears the center of town.  It's almost\nas if this were a hidden oasis tucked deep within the forest.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is constructed from old and weather-worn planks, most of which\nwere probably stolen from other structures.  A skimpy door covers the\nentrance.\n~\nE\nlean-to~\nTo the south, a lean-to has been constructed among the trees.  It appears\nto be made of nothing but branches, but it blends into the surrounding\nvegetation so well it is difficult to tell from here.\n~\nS\n#17203\nA lean-to in the woods.~\nThe lean-to has been constructed from bundles of branches lashed to a\ncross-support, which in turn has been secured to two trees.  The \"roof\"\nslopes down toward the southeast corner and is open to the north, where\na small footpath leads back to the trail.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17202\nE\neast west walls vegetation~\nThe lean-to has no walls as such, though a number of vines have draped \nover the roof to provide some protection from the wind.\n~\nE\nroof up~\nThe \"roof\" is nothing but dead branches tied into bundles with vines and\npiled deep enough across the supporting branch to provide shelter from the\nelements.  Not much, but you can tell it's probably effective.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the lean-to is nothing but soft grass.  There is a large\nindentation toward the back--obviously where someone has been sleeping on\na regular basis of late.\n~\nS\n#17204\nA large shack.~\nThe shack is constructed of weathered planks, obviously salvaged from\nother buildings.  Vines and branches from the forest outside poke through\nthe occasional gaps in the walls, but the shack seems to be holding up\nwell.  The door to the south leads back to the trail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor skimpy~\n16387 0 17202\nE\nvines branches wall north east west~\nThe weathered planks appear to be randomly nailed together.  What gaps\nwere left have long ago been covered by the vegetation of the dense forest\noutside.  Other than some interesting construction work, there is little\nelse of interest on the walls.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe dirt floor is clean, but doesn't look very comfortable.  It would\nprovide a dry place to rest, though.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling has been constructed of the same planks as the walls.  \nThough originally full of gaps and holes, the vegetation overgrowing the\nshack has made the roof neatly watertight.\n~\nE\nskimpy door~\nThe door consists of several thin boards nailed to some branches for\nsupport.  It appears to work like any other door . . ..\n~\nS\n#17205\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail continues toward the heart of the village.  A poorly-built\nshack lies to the north, while a more durable stone hut lies to the south.\nThe buildings continue along the trail ahead to what looks like a\ncrossroads or village square, and the trail leads back east to the dense\nforest.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17206\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17202\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door is made of hardwood planks and sturdy supports.  It would be\na tough one to break down . . . you might want to try just opening it.\n~\nE\nstone hut~\nThe hut to the south is constructed of solid stone walls with a proper,\nand well-maintained, thatch roof.  A solid wood door sits in the wall\ndirectly to your south, and the hut seems to continue to the west, where\nyou spot a window.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail continues through the trees, which are now thinning enough\nfor you to see that it leads to the west through town, and perhaps even\nwidens a little as it goes.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is a poor effort at shelter, and seems to consist of nothing\nmore than boards and branches tied to trees.  A small opening at the front\nserves as a door.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nYou'd have to go farther to the west to look into the window.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy continues to thin as you approach the center of town, and you\ncan tell that it eventually fades to the west.  You see bright shafts of\nsunlight breaking through the canopy in that direction, and the town\nlooks a lot less gloomy.\n~\nS\n#17206\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more that planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.  You might want to use the door to the south to get back on the\ntrail and out of harm's way.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nE\nwalls north east west planks~\nThe planks used to \"make\" the walls vary in size.  They also vary in\ncolor, shape and the means by which they are held together.  It's quite\nthe menagerie of construction methods.  You get the impression that a\nlot of the credit for the fact that the structure is still standing\nshould go to the vines outside, whose roots wrap tightly around anything\nexposed to the outside.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17207\nA large stone hut.~\nThe interior of the hut is dark and damp.  The stone walls are bare on the\ninside, and except for several mats on the floor there is nothing in the\nroom.  You hear voices to the west, and can see from the flickering light\naround the edges of the curtain hanging in the doorway that a fire is\nburning there.  The smell of cooking meat tempts you, but you can also\ngo through the door to the north and get on the main trail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17209\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door to the outside is made of sturdy hardwood planks.  It provides\ngood security, and, unlike most of the doors in this town, seems to have\nactually been made for the doorway it inhabits.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn of clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\ndown floor mat~\nSeveral worn reed mats lie about the floor, apparently serving as beds\nfor the current residents of the hut.\n~\nE\nroof ceiling thatch~\nLarge bundles of reeds, tied with vines, have been piled across a\ncarefully planned set of cross-supports.  This roof surely has no\nproblems with leaks.\n~\nE\nwalls south east stone~\nThe walls are constructed of square limestone blocks, obviously cut\ncarefully to fit.  You're surprised at the effort that went into them,\nand wonder if this building wasn't meant to be something more.\n~\nS\n#17208\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail approaches a small crossroads to the west, and what looks like\nit might be a fountain sits in the midst of the path in that direction.\nTo the east, the trail continues to the forest at the edge of town.  To the\nnorth is a stone building which appears to be a store of some sort, and\nto the south lies a stone hut.  The entrance to the hut is to the east,\nthough the window in front of you seems as if it might allow you to see\ninside.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17210\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nE\nletter sign~\nThe letters are difficult to make out, but with some effort, you can see\nthat the sign reads:  Blacksmith.\n~\nE\nbuilding store~\nThe building to the north looks to be a storefront, though it is in\ngreat disrepair.  The door covering the entrance is old, but appears as\nif it might still work.  As you get closer, you notice the presence of\nfaint lettering painted above the door.\n~\nE\nsouth hut~\nThe walls of the hut are in good shape, and the thick thatch roof\nsuggests some work has been done to keep this building up.  There is a door\ndown the trail to the east which seems to lead inside, and a window set\ninto the wall in front of you.  You think you see the flicker of flames\nthrough the window, but you can't be sure.\n~\nE\ndoor old~\nThe door is worn and weathered, and the hinges a bit rusty, but it\nseems likely you could still open it.\n~\nE\nup trees~\nThe sun fights its way through the boughs above and, when the branches\nget blown just the right way in the wind, the occasional warm ray of light\nreaches your face.  The canopy shows more signs of life as you move farther\nfrom the dense forests to the east.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here, and straightens out as the trees thin.  \nThe ground is a bit wet, which you attribute to the leaky fountain to the\nwest.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is very dirty, but you can make out a dimly-lit room inside\nthe hut.  There seems to be a door on the west side of the room, and\nanother on the east.  The flickering of a small fire draws your attention\nto a small hearth set into the wall.  You aren't sure, but there appears\nto be movement in the shadows.\n~\nS\n#17209\nThe kitchen of a stone hut.~\nThe kitchen of this hut is rather crude, but certainly effective.  A\nsmall hearth is set into the wall, with a variety of racks for hanging\npots and kettles.  A long countertop runs along the opposite wall, with\na series of bins for food storage beneath.  You imagine this building\nmight have once been a small cafe.  A curtain covers the entrance to the\nadjoining room to the east, and another door leads to the west.  A window\nset into the north wall admits just enough light to let you look around.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17214\nE\nsouth wall~\nThe stone walls appear to have once been carefully cut to fit.  Recent\nabuse, most likely in the form of clubs, swords and heads being bashed\ninto them, has seriously altered their appearance.  They're pitted all\nover, and large chunks are missing in several places.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof of the hut is very sturdy, and probably does a nice job of\nkeeping the place dry.\n~\nE\nwindow north~\nThrough the dirty window you can just make out the trail running east\nand west through town to the north of the hut.  Across the street you\nsee another stone building.\n~\nE\ngroove gouge~\nThe gouges look to have been made from stuff being thrown into, or at,\nthe box on a regular basis.  Maybe the stockboy wasn't too careful.\n~\nE\nbox bin~\nThe wooden box shows signs of wear, and has a number of grooves and\ngouges, both inside and out.  It is currently empty, however.\n~\nE\ncountertop~\nThe countertop is constructed of thick planking laid across a frame\nof sturdy posts.  It runs the full length of the wall, and a box has\nbeen built beneath it to serve as a storage bin.\n~\nE\nfire hearth~\nA small fire is burning in the hearth, started perhaps to prepare this\nevening's dinner.  Unfortunately, you don't see dinner itself anywhere.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn from clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\nrack pots kettle~\nA crude iron rack hangs above the fire awaiting a pot to hold over the\nfire.  The pots and kettles appear to be clean and usable, but are empty.\nApparently what you smelled from next door was yesterday's leftovers.\n~\nS\n#17210\nBennie's Blacksmith Shop.~\nYou've entered the interior of what was once clearly a blacksmith shop.\nA large hearth sits in the center of the room, providing access from\nall sides.  Rotted shelves line the walls, and a pair of tongs and a\nbillows lie rotting on the countertop.  Though the place might of once\nbeen quite busy, it appears that its better days are long past.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17208\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17212\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is slowly being overtaken by grass.  You attribute the deep\ndepression near the sliding door to the presence of horses once passing\nin and out for shoeing.  Other than this, the floor is bare--long ago\nvictim to the local scavangers.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nShafts of light pierce the weakened roof in many places, suggesting that\nthis building probably isn't very dry in the rain.  The light casts a dim\naura about the room.\n~\nE\nsliding door~\nThe sliding door to the west provides a wide berth to the street when\nopen.  It would appear that this is where Bennie once brought local\nhorses in and out of the building for shoeing.\n~\nE\neast wall~\nThe remains of a long countertop and storage shelves line the east wall.\n~\nE\nhearth~\nA circular hearth sits in the center of the room, built upon a stone\nfoundation.  The interior shows the scars of many fires, and the large\nchunks of rock missing around the edges suggest that perhaps it has\nbeen hit with a hammer repeatedly in the past.  The remains of several\nsmall fires sit in the bottom of the hearth, but you can tell it has\nbeen some time since it hosted a real blacksmith's furnace.\n~\nE\ncounter countertop~\nAt one time, a long countertop served as a workspace, running the entire\nlength of the east wall.  Like the shelves above it, though, it has been\nstripped of all useful pieces, and consists now of nothing more than a\nrotting frame.\n~\nE\nshelf shelves~\nLong, sturdy shelves at one time covered most of the interior walls in this\nbuilding, providing a massive amount of storage space.  Most of the wood\nhas long ago rotted or been removed for use elsewhere in town, though, and\nnot much remains but the frames.\n~\nE\nbillows~\nThere's not much left of the billows but the wooden frame.  It looks\nas though a leather \"bag\" for holding air might once have been attached,\nbut it has long ago rotted.  The only thing these would be useful for\nnow would be the wood scraps.\n~\nE\ntongs~\nThe tongs are old and rusted, and show the wear and tear of being thrusted\ninto the scorching flames time and time again.  Unfortunately, they aren't\nin any condition to salvage.\n~\nS\n#17211\nCrossroads at the center of town.~\nYou stand at the center of town, where the trail forms a sort of a\ncrossroad.  To the north you see a \"street\" that ends in a dead end.  The\nbuildings along each side appear to be nicer than those in the rest of\ntown.  The trail continues east and west through town, and another\nleads south, running between more buildings before it eventually leaves\ntown.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nE\ntrail~\nThe trail continues east and west to the edges of town at least.  To the\nsouth it widens a bit and appears to eventually become a road.\n~\nE\nstreet~\nThe street runs north and comes to an end at a building.  Other\nbuildings line the east and west sides.  It looks a little more promising\nthan the rest of town, and perhaps like it might have been the first\npart of town constructed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy has thinned considerably, and you can see now that the forest\nthins overhead to the west and the south.  Sunlight sneaks through in\nplaces, casting an eerie light over this part of Shadowvale.\n~\nE\ndown mud~\nYuck.  The mud has covered your boots, and you can feel the water seeping\ninto your socks . . ..\n~\nS\n#17212\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to a dead end at the wall of a stone\nbuilding several doors down.  This section of town looks somewhat more\npermanent than the rest, and the buildings are all of stone.  A wooden\ndoor leads to the building to the west, and a large sliding door provides\naccess to the stone building to the east.  To the south lies the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17210\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17217\nE\nslinding door~\nThe large wooden door hangs from a metal rail, and slides to one side\nto provide access to the building.  It would appear to be some sort\nof loading dock, or perhaps a stable door.\n~\nE\nwest structure~\nFour sturdy stone walls uphold the frame of a very old building, yet\nyou can see that the roof is in serious disrepair.  Planks have been\nstripped from the windows and awnings, most likely for use elsewhere in\ntown.  The door is battered, but is closed and probably rusted shut.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy above is much lighter, and you see small patches of sky\nbetween the boughs.  The forest thickens to the east and north, hanging\ndrearily over the edges of the village.  To the south and east it thins,\nand it looks as though the sun may actually be shining through.\n~\nE\ndown trail ground~\nThe trail here is heavily travelled.  It looks like most of the traffic\nleads to the huts at the end, as weeds grow freely along the rest of the\nbuildings.\n~\nE\neast building~\nThe building to the east looks to have once been a store of some sort.\nThe door on this side of the building is large, and slides to one side.\nIt looks like it might have been a loading dock, or maybe even a small\nstable.  A hitching post runs along the side of the building.\n~\nE\npost hitching~\nA worn branch has been mounted across two posts alongside the building.\nAt one time, judging from the considerable wear, many horses were tied\nhere on a regular basis.\n~\nS\n#17213\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail wanders west from the crossroads through another section of\ntown.  The walls of the buildings to the north and south of the crossroads\nlie to each side.  Several other buildings line the trail before it\neventually leads to the edge of town.  To the east lie the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy thins the further west you go, until it eventually\ndisappears somewhere beyond the edge of town.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is still narrow and winding along this stretch of town, but\nit would appear that it widens a bit to the west.\n~\nE\nnorth south walls~\nThe buildings to each side of the trail are made of stone and allow\nno access from this side.  You note that it looks like the roof is\ncollapsing a little on the building to the north.\n~\nS\n#17214\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail passes between two stone structures as it continues north\nand south through town.  To your north lies a small crossroads, and to\nthe south the trail leads to the edge of town.  The hut to the east is\nin good shape, but a door prevents you from seeing inside.  To the west\nlies a stone shanty.  A curtain made of a thick hide is pulled tightly\nacross the doorway, and strange markings are scrawled in red along each\nside of the entrance.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17209\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17228\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here and takes on the appearance of an actual\nroad.  It looks as though this southern route gets used often--the dirt\nis well-packed and the path free from grass.\n~\nE\nmarkings red sign~\nThe markings are in a script you don't recognize, but they have a\ndecidely evil feeling about them.  You get the impression the paint used\nto make them was probably blood . . ..\n~\nE\ncurtain hide~\nThe curtain is simply the hide of a large animal, perhaps an oxen or\nwater buffalo.  It's secured from the top, and seems to be tied loosely\nat the bottom as well.  You should be able to open it, though.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy continues to thin to the south, and the forest retreats\nsomewhat behind the buildings.  It feels a lot less enclosed here.  The\nsun breaks through the trees to warm your face, and a gentle breeze blows\nfrom the south.\n~\nE\nhut~\nThe hut is a fine, stone building.  The exterior masonry is of high \nquality, and the roof is in good shape.  You note a small quantity of smoke\nwafting from the top of the chimney.\n~\nE\nshanty~\nThe shanty is built of loosely-fitted stone which appears to be more\n\"piled\" than \"fitted\".  You can see that the roof is old, but see no\nmajor holes.  It might be a good place to rest . . . if it isn't inhabited.\n~\nS\n#17215\nThe remains of a shack.~\nYou stand in the midst of a deteriorating shack.  It appears as if it was\nonce attached to the store to the south, perhaps as workspace.  Shelves\nline the stone walls, and an old anvil stands in the corner.  The wall to\nthe west is almost entirely collapsed, providing access to the trail\noutside.  To the south a door connects to the storefront.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17210\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nLittle remains of the roof but the rafters, which are now largely\nover-grown with vines.  With a little work, you could find a sheltered\ncorner to rest in.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nGrass has started to re-take the ground inside the hut.  There is still\na lot of bare ground, and it appears as though someone has been sleeping\nhere regularly.\n~\nE\nnorth east wall shelves shelf~\nSturdy shelves have been built directly into the stone walls, providing\na significant amount of storage space.  They have long been stripped of\nanything of value they might once have held, and are home to only dust\nnow.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door isn't too sturdy, and was clearly designed to be an interior\nfixture.  It appears to be in good working condition.\n~\nS\n#17216\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to an end soon at the wall of a stone hut.\nTo the south, it leads back to the center of town.  An empty doorway leads\nto the building to the west, and the wall of the building to the east has\ncollapsed, allowing you access.  The prospects look best to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17219\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17218\nE\ndown trail~\nIt doesn't look much like anyone ever stops here.  The trail is well\nworn running north and south, but weeds cover the ground to the east and\nwest.  You note a slight rise as the trail runs north.\n~\nE\nup~\nIt's amazing how fast the canopy thickens, and a dull grey has set in\nabout you.  You can see that the edge of the forst lies just beyond the\nbuildings in all directions, and you're surprised that is hasn't yet\nengulfed the whole town.\n~\nE\ncollapsed wall rubble~\nThe remains of the wall consist of large stones and mortar.  It won't\ntake much effort to climb over it.\n~\nS\n#17217\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17218\nA sturdy lean-to.~\nAll that remains of the once proud stone building that stood here is the\nfront wall.  The back wall is partially collapsed, and is now a waist-high\npile of rubble.  Some enterprising resident has constructed a roof between\nthe two walls by laying branches and reeds across a series of slim poles.\nIt's not pretty, but it's clean and looks rather comfortable.  The trail\nlies to the east.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nnorth south~\nThe walls of the neighboring building are covered with scattered vines\nand large patches of mold.  Not very attractive, but interesting . . ..\n~\nE\nbranches reed roof ceiling~\nMost of the original branches used to create the ceiling are long-dead\nand starting to rot.  The mass of vegetation from the forest beyond has\ngrown over much of it, though, and has nicely filled gaps as they formed.\n~\nE\nrubble back~\nThe pile of rubble, which consists of mostly large blocks of stone,\nstands about chest-high to a dwarf.  You'd probably have to crawl to\nactually get back to it . . . and it certainly doesn't look like it's\nworth the effort.\n~\nS\n#17219\nThe end of the dead-end street.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the wall of a large stone structure.  It's\nhard to tell for sure, but you'd guess that the building to the north is\npart of either the building to the east or west, or maybe both.  A sturdy\noak door covers the entrance of the shack to the east, and a strong, solid\niron door blocks the entrance to the hut to your west.  You can try your\nluck with either of those, or take the trail back to the south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17220\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17223\nE\nup~\nYou feel claustrophobic beneath the shadow of the overhanging trees\nalong this end of the street.  The owners of these homes obviously didn't\nchoose the location for the wealth of sunlight it offers.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail branches neatly to the left and right to the entrances of the\ntwo buildings.  It would seem that the residents use it a lot.\n~\nE\nnorth wall~\nIt's as good a wall as you've ever seen, but that's about it.  It looks\nlike someone might even be clearing the vines off of it on occasion.\n~\nE\nsturdy oak~\nThe door is made of heavy oak planks that bear the scars of many seasons.\nIt looks like it might bear the scars of a few swordfights as well.  It's\nno worse for the wear, though, and if it's locked you won't likely be\ngetting in without a key.\n~\nE\niron~\nThis huge door is constructed of solid iron, decorated with the occasional\nrivet to hold the hinges and latch.  Considering that it's attached to a\nwindowless stone building, you imagine it might once have been a bank or\nsome other important structure.\n~\nS\n#17220\nLiving room of a small house.~\nYou can see, now that you are inside, that this shack is actually more\nof a home.  Sparse furnishings litter the room, and a picture hangs on the\nwall above a small fireplace.  It's actually rather cozy.  The front\ndoor leads back to the trail, and another door leads north to an adjoining\nroom.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17221\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17219\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nThis house has a proper roof, with relatively new planking serving to\nkeep the elements at bay.  You venture a guess that someone probably\nlives here regularly.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is nothing but packed and swept dirt, but it has aged well\nand is very clean.  You're surprised, in fact, at how clean this whole\nplace is.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls of cut stone are clean and free of the mold you see growing\non other buildings in Shadowvale.  The more you look it over, the more\nyou like this place.\n~\nE\npicture~\nA drawing of an ugly giant in a crude wood frame hangs slightly askew\non the wall.  The inscription below reads \"Brutus\".  You wonder if it's\ntrue that a mother always thinks her child is cute . . . and, if so, just\nwhat Brutus' mother might look like . . ..\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nA small stone hearth set into the stone wall flickers brightly from the\nsmall fire within.  The rack inside suggests it might also be used for\ncooking as well.\n~\nS\n#17221\nBrutus' Guest Room.~\nThis room is nicely furnished with a bed, a small nightstand and a desk.\nAgain, it is spotless.  You realize now that this is probably the guest\nquarters for the larger house across the street to the west.  This looks\nlike it would be a nice place to rest, or the door to the south will\ntake you back to the living room.\n~\n0 D 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17220\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof in this room is the same as that in the adjoining room, and it\nseems to be connected to the building next door.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor here is well-kept as well.  A nice rug made from the skin of\nsome unknown animal lies alongside the bed, and there's not a dust ball\nto be found.\n~\nE\nbed~\nThe bed is nothing but a simple cot, but it looks plenty comfortable.\n~\nE\nrug skin~\nThe hide is a dark black in color, with thick, coarse hair.  If pressed\nfor an answer, you'd guess it was from a large bear.\n~\nE\nnight stand table~\nA small wooden table serves as a nightstand next to the bed.  An oil\nlamp, built into the center of the table, provides light for the room.\n~\nE\noil lamp~\nIt's a very simple lamp, but it's unique in that it's somehow fixed\nto the table.  It's much to awkward to be of use anywhere else, and\nserves its purpose here very well.\n~\nE\nwalls north west east~\nThe stone walls are almost polished from constant brushing and cleaning.\nYou're impressed at the effort put into the upkeep of this place,\nespecially when you consider the neighborhood.\n~\nS\n#17222\nInside Windrunner's Crystal Ball~\nYou find yourself suspended in the air amidst a kaleidoscope of swirling\nmist.  After a moment, you realize you have been transferred to the inside\nof Windrunner's Crystal Ball--where he puts imputent mortals he needs to\nattend to . . ..  You feel it would be best to wait and see what he wants.\n~\n0 CDKNT 9\nO windrunner~\nE\nmist swirling~\nThe mist swirls about you in a fantastic variety of colors.  You find the\neffect almost mesmerizing.\n~\nS\n#17223\nThe entrance to Brutus' house.~\nYou've entered a small room that serves as the foyer for a rather\nlarge hut.  Actually, it's almost a house.  Several pairs of boots\nare lined neatly along the wall, and above them a series of hooks\nwait patiently for someone to hang a coat on them.  Other than this, the\nroom is bare.  You hear voices coming from the adjoining room to the\nnorth, and an iron door leads east.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17224\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17219\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe sturdy roof is constructed of heavy planking across a timber frame.\nFrom the looks of it, this house was built to endure.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor, though generally free of debris, is a bit muddy.  You hope it\ndoesn't mess up your nice boots.\n~\nE\nwest south wall~\nThe walls are made of large stone blocks, cut to fit tightly.  They are\nworn smooth with age, but remain sturdy.  Spikes have been driven into\nthem in various places to serve as hangers.\n~\nE\nspike hanger~\nIt's your basic metal spike . . . and it's driven securely into the wall.\n~\nE\niron door~\nThe heavy iron door looks a lot less imposing from the inside than it\ndid from the trail.  In fact, you're guessing it isn't solid at all, and\nis probably just a facade to fool the local \"wildlife\".\n~\nE\nboots~\nThe boots are smelly and worn, and you decide quickly you don't really\nwant to examine them further . . . ..\n~\nS\n#17224\nBrutus' Waiting Room.~\nYou are in what appears to be a waiting room, or perhaps a common room,\nfor the larger house about you.  The room is bare except for three logs\nthat serve as chairs and a picture on the wall.  A torch affixed to the\nwall provides enough light for you to see back into the entryway to the\nsouth, but, strangely, you see no other doors.  You could have sworn that\nfrom the outside this place looked a lot bigger . . ..\n  Maybe you were wrong.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17225\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17223\nE\ntorch~\nIt's a simple torch, and it's secured to the wall . . . .\n~\nE\npicture~\nA charcoal sketch of a giant, who appears to be a thief, adorns the\neast wall.  It's not life-size, but it's at least four feet in height.\nThe word \"Brutus\" is written along the bottom of the sketch.  You're\ncertain that Brutus isn't the type of guy you'd want to invite to your\nMom's house for dinner . . ..\n~\nE\nwest north wall~\nThe walls, though clean, are unadorned.  Someone must have figured they\nwere working hard enough just holding up the ceiling.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling in this room takes on a slight A-Frame appearance.  You\njudge from its construction that this room was built sometime before,\nand in a much better fashion, than the entryway to the south.\n~\nS\n#17225\nBrutus' bedroom.~\nYou've entered Brutus' private sanctuary.  A small desk sits in the corner,\nand is covered in slips of paper and ledgers.  Apparently Brutus is the\nhead honcho in these parts.  A bedroll is unrolled in front of the hearth,\nwhere a small fire warms the room.  You can exit to the west through the\nsecret door, or another door will take you north.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17226\nD3\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17224\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16451 0 11185\nE\nsecret picture~\nTo the west a hole has been roughly hewn into the wall, and you can see\nthat it's been covered with a crudely fashion door to which the picture\nwas then mounted.  Very ingenious.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt is clean, except for small piles of wood\nscraps around the hearth.  The bedroll occupies a corner of the room.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is constructed of spaced planks with wood shingles laid over\nthem.  It would seem that this isn't the orginal roof, and that perhaps\nBrutus had some work done recently.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls are made of stone and mortar.  They're discolored with age,\nbut basically in good shape.\n~\nE\nbedroll~\nThe bedroll is nothing but an old, ratty blanket, and you imagine it's\nprobably the source fo the horrible smell in the room.\n~\nE\nhearth fire~\nA small hearth is set into the wall, and a fire has recently been started.\nIt looks like Brutus was settling in for the evening.\n~\nE\nslips paper ledger~\nSeveral slips marked \"I.O.U.\" lay scattered about a large ledger.  In it\nBrutus seems to be tracking his income.  It looks like he's not only\ntrafficking in stolen merchandise, but collecting \"taxes\" from the local\nresidents as well.  From what you know about numbers, Brutus appears to\nbe doing very nicely for himself.\n~\nE\ndesk~\nIt's a small, simple desk.  It's made of wood, with a stone top.  There\nare holes in the front where drawers used to be, but Brutus seems to have\nfound little use for them.\n~\nS\n#17226\nBrutus' closet.~\nThis small closet is where Brutus probably keeps his inventory.  Too bad\nfor you his stock seems to be depleted.  The door to the south takes you\nback to the main bedroom.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17225\nD5\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17227\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling of the closet slopes steeply as it's near the edge of the\nhut.  Other than a few rope marks where someone seems to have hung something\nheavy, there's little of interest up there.\n~\nE\nnorth west east walls~\nThe closet has the same stone walls as the rest of the hut . . . what\ndid you expect?\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the closet isn't as clean as the floor of the room outside.\nIn fact, it looks a bit like the dirt has been recently disturbed . . ..\n~\nS\n#17227\nBrutus' secret storage room.~\nThat Brutus, he's a pretty smart guy.  The room has been dug beneath\nthe closet, and is rather crude.  It's big enough to store quite a bit\nof illegal merchandise in, though--even if it doesn't stay very clean.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD4\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17226\nE\nnorth south east west down walls dirt~\nThe walls are dirt, and they aren't very well-supported.  Little bits\nhave caved in here and there, and in several spots it looks like sharp\nweapons, maybe spears, were stuck into the walls for storage.  You wonder\nhow many good rains it will take until this whole end of the house sinks\ninto the ground.\n~\nE\nup secret~\nYou can see from below that the secret door is made from thick planks,\nand is laid across the top of the hole.  Brutus made it thick enough to\nseem real when he closed it and spread the dirt over it--but he just\nain't as smart as you, is he?\n~\nS\n#17228\nThe Cleric's Shanty.~\nThe small altar in the corner suggests that this shack is the home of\nthe local priest.  Other than the altar and a small cot, the room is bare\nof furnishings and possessions.  The door to the east leads back to the\ntrail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17214\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt shows a worn path from the door to the altar.\nIt would seem many have made that particular walk.  It would also seem\nthat they have tracked all sorts of dirt and other gross things in with\nthem.  You can see why the priest made the cot.\n~\nE\ncot bed~\nA simple cot, consisting of a board laid across to pieces of firewood,\nsits in the corner of the shack.  It looks really uncomfortable, but\nyou could see the advantages of it over, say, sleeping on the floor.\n~\nE\ndoor curtain hide~\nThe door to the shack consists of a simple hide nail to the upper\ncorners.  Apparently the priest trusts his clientele a little more\nthat you would.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is made of randomly over-laid planks.  The gaps\nare plugged with rags and other assorted materials, and the effort looks\nto be mildly successful.\n~\nE\nnorth west south walls~\nThe walls of the shack are simply planks, coated with a thin film of\nwhat looks like mud.  If it was an attempt at plaster, it was a very bad\none.  They do serve to keep the elements at bay, however . . ..\n~\nS\n#17229\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail continues north and south through Shadowvale.  To the north\nyou see a crossroads and what appears to be a fountain.  To the south,\nthe trail becomes a road out of town.  A poorly-constructed shack lies\nto your east, while a much nicer one lies to the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17230\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor flimsy~\n16387 0 17231\nE\ntrail down~\nThe trail leads north and south here, and appears to be heavily-trodden.\n~\nE\nwest shack~\nTo the west sits a nice shack that has been connected directly to the\nbuilding to the north and the ruins to the south.  A flimsy door has\nbeen set into the entrance, and a small window sits off to one side of\nthe door.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the trees above in various places, dispelling\nsome of the eerie shadows from the trees above.  This place is still\ndefinitely on the wierd side of creepy, though.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is covered in dirt.  As you wipe a spot clean, you note that\nthe curtains are drawn and you can't see in anyway.\n~\nE\ndoor flimsy~\nThe door most likely keeps out nothing but the rain.  Still, it'd be\neasier to open it than to kick it in . . ..\n~\nS\n#17230\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more than planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.  You might want to use the door to the west to get back on the\ntrail and out of harm's way.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nE\nplanks patch scrap~\nThe planks are of varying sizes and shapes, and, it would appear,\nthickness.  They are spotted with pieces of cloth, hide and anything\nelse that was available to keep out the rain.\n~\nE\nnorth east south walls~\nThe walls, such as they are, are a conglomeration of materials put\ntogether as availability and need dictated.  \"Mess\" is the first word\nthat comes to mind.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17231\nThe common shack.~\nThis well-maintained shack seems to serve as a common home to a variety\nof Shadowdale's residents.  Several bedrolls cover the floor, and gear\nof all kinds sits about the room.  You get the feeling, however, that the\nresidents wouldn't be ideal roommates . . ..

Not \nmuch, but it's a dry place to sleep.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is mostly branches woven into a tight sheet.\nYou get the feeling it probably leaks when it rains.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe doors of this shack are simply weather-worn planks tied together\nalong cross-supports.  You could probably put your fist through them if\nyou had to, but it would be easier just to open them . . .\n~\nE\nnorth south wall~\nThe walls of the shack are simple, unadorned planks, many of which seem\nto have come from other buildings . . ..\n~\nE\ngear~\nA variety of gear in states of general mis-use lie about the room.  While\nsome of it may once have been useful, it's all junk now.\n~\nE\nbed bedrolls~\nSeveral piles of hides lie scattered about the room serving as beds.\nThey look as if they are used regularly.\n~\nS\n#17232\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail winds between two more buildings before it leads south out of\ntown.  As it leaves town, the trail leads slowly down into a wide valley.\nThe trees continue to thin in that direction, and you can't be sure, but\nyou think you see the glint of sunlight reflecting off water far down in\nthe valley.  The trail leads north back into town.  To the west are the\ncharred remains of a burned-out building, and to the east a sturdy, well-\nbuilt shack.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17233\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17235\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17234\nE\nshack hut east~\nThe hut to the east is constructed mostly of stone.  \"Patches\" of planks,\nmortar, branches and vines cover holes where larger stones have broken\nloose from the foundation.  The repairs look almost as sturdy as the\nremaining foundation, if not moreso.  It's clearly an old building, but\nsomeone is making an effort to keep it well-maintained.\n  A solid oak door is set into the doorway, blocking your view inside.\n~\nE\nvine patch mortar branch~\nSomeone seems to have patched holes in the foundation of the hut with\na mixture of muddy mortar and branches.  Vines have taken root, providing\nan overlying web of flora.  The patches give the hut a very \"earthy\"\nappearance, almost like a large, moss-covered rock with a nice patch\nof sod growing on top.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is well-trodden here, and it appears many pairs of boots have\nmade the journey south.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun struggles to break through the canopy here, and it appears to\nbe having much more success to the south.  You see birds among the boughs\nof the oaks again, and the chatter of squirrels filters down from far\nabove.\n~\nE\ndoor oak plank~\nThe door to this hut has been cut from a single width of hard oak\nplanking.  It looks very secure, which is good, but rare, in this\nneighborhood.  If it's locked, it would probably be easier to cut a\nhole in the wall than to break it down.\n~\nS\n#17233\nA well-built hut.~\nYou have entered a very comfortable shack.  Though the only furniture\nis a bed in one corner, the shack appears to have been recently cleaned.\nThe walls are solid, and the roof is strong enough to keep out the rain.\nWhat a wonderful place to hide away and rest.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17232\nE\noak plank~\nThe door looks as solid from the inside as it did from outside.  You\nadmire the beautiful grain of the wood . . .\n~\nE\nup~\nThe hut has a sod roof, supported by long, straight limbs culled from\nthe surrounding forest.  Someone did a very nice job of building it.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor of the hut is basically hard-packed dirt.  However, it's\npacked very well, and is almost as solid as stone.\n~\nE\nwalls east north south~\nThe walls of the hut consist of a waist-high stone foundation and smooth\nplanks above that.  They are entirely bare, and could use some decoration.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe door looks just as good inside, and is in very good shape.  If you\nwere to close it, it would probably keep unwanted characters out.\n~\nS\n#17234\nThe remains of a burned building.~\nYou stand amidst the charred ruins of what once might have been a very\nnice shack.  There certainly was a lot of wood in it, as the ashes are\nknee deep and charcoal beams still attempt to hold a roof that no longer\nexists.  You might find something if you rummage, but the place looks\nlike it's been well-scavanged.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\nvegetation forest vines~\nBranches from the forest beyond have grown through the remaining wall\nsupports, protruding into the room.  Large vines have used the branches\nto bridge their way in as well, and are slowly overtaking the area.  You\nare amazed at the resilience of the forest behind the building, and can't\neven imagine how horrible it would be to get stuck in it.\n~\nE\nashes ruins~\nDeep piles of gray ashes, matted into flat mounds by wind and rain,\nprovide an eerie backdrop for the grim black beams which rise like the\ntrees on some lost desert plain.  This place is creepy, even by local\nstandards.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest has already begun to reclaim the back wall of the house.  The\nvines have made themselves at home on the remaining wall supports, and\nhave created an impassable wall of vegetation.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nA short stone foundation survived on the southern side of the lot, \ndefiantly supporting the last remains of the only thing that can be clearly\nidentified as a wall.  Through the remains you can see that the forest\nappears to thin to the south, and you see the trail leading south into\nthe woods just in front of the building.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nThe owners of the building to the north seem to have salvaged a lot of\nthe useful materials from this site, and used them to re-build their\nsouthern wall.  They didn't do a very good job, though, and none of the\npieces fit together.  Cracks and holes appear all over.\n~\nE\nhole crack~\nYou can make out faint shapes inside the shack.  It's too dark to be\nsure, but judging from the whispering and sounds of shuffling, it sounds\nlike the residents might be home . . . and there's more than one person\nat home.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe gray ashes are a little damp, and are making a mess of your boots.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is much thinner here than at the northern edges of town, and\nthe occasional ray of sun sneaks through.  It appears that the trees\ncontinue to thin to the south.\n~\nS\n#17235\nA trail leading south out of town.~\nYou stand on the southern edge of the small village of Shadowvale.  The\ntown, which spreads out to your north, has a dark and menacing feel about\nit--even here you feel many eyes watching you.

The forest is just thin enough that\nyou could leave the trail without getting too horribly lost, but you see\nnothing of interest that would justify the effort.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun beams down upon you brightly as you look up to see squirrels\nplaying among the trees.  The forest is very peaceful here, but turns\ndark and ominous just to the north.\n~\nE\nsign~\n----------------\n    |  Sorry Brave   |\n    | Adventurers... |\n    |                |\n    |     The        |\n    |   Southern     |\n    |    Realms      |\n    |   Are Still    |\n    |     Under      |\n    |  Construction  |\n     ----------------\n           | |\n           | |\n~\nS\n#17236\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trees thin considerably along this stretch of the trail, and sunlight\nbeams warmly upon you.  An empty lot lies to your north, and you can see\na small grove of pine trees lying just beyond.  To your south are the\nremains of an old shack.  The trail to the west leads to the edge of town,\nand there appears to be a crossroads further into town to the east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17237\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is almost clear at this spot.  It would seem the locals have\nharvested a few trees in the surrounding area.  Mmmmm, that sun feels \ngood, eh?\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-trodden, and continues to widen to the west.\n~\nE\nsouth remains shack~\nThe shack is in major disrepair, but still standing.  It might still\nprovide shelter . . . if you can wedge yourself into a dry corner.  The\ndoorway is empty, the door long-ago stolen for some other housing project.\n~\nS\n#17237\nA campsite in an empty lot.~\nThis vacant lot has been used as a campsite so many times that it has\ntaken on a permanent appearance.  The remains of several fires are\nscattered about the site, and a pine grove that begins on the north\nend of the lot provides nice cover for sleeping.  You can go into the\ngrove to your north, or to the trail through town to the south.

You can make out a clearing to the north in the pine\ngrove, and taller weeds along the walls on each side of the lot provide\nnice protection from the wind.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest has thinned to only scattered trees, and the sun beams down\nupon the lot.  Shade can be gained under the pines to the north, and you\ncan see the forest rising above the far side of the grove.\n~\nE\neast west wall~\nA barrier of weeds and shrubs rings the lot along the edges of the\nneighboring buildings.  The walls appear to be solid and offer no access\nto the inside of either structure.\n~\nE\ncampfire fire~\nSeveral blackened circles surrounded with stones are scattered about\nthe lot.  Half-burned logs, apparently from the pine forest, lie rotting\naround the edges of each site.\n~\nS\n#17238\nA small pine grove.~\nYou have wandered into a small pine grove tucked away behind the homes\nin this area.  The underbrush has been tamed in this clearing, and the\nfresh scent of the small pines is quite refreshing.  The grove continues\nto your north and west.  To your east lies the back wall of a shack, and\nto the south a campsite.  It appears that the pine needles which litter\nthe ground would make a wonderful place to sleep.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17239\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17237\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17241\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees at the front of the grove look young and healthy, as if \nperhaps they are thinned regularly, or used for firewood.  They provide\nnice shelter for the grove, though they aren't much for climbing.\n~\nE\nwall shack east~\nThe wall of the shack is overgrown with flowery vines.  There do not\nappear to be any windows or other distinguishing features.\n~\nE\nflowery vines~\nThe vines appear to be from the morning glory family.  They cover the\nwall in thick patterns, sprouting patches of beautiful purple teacup\nshaped flowers here and there.  Insects and small birds play contentedly\nin the cover they provide.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe bed of pine needles which covers the ground is quite thick.  There\nare patches here and there where piles of needles have been gathered, most\nlikely for use in building fire.  The softness of the ground is a welcome\ntreat for your aching feet.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe boughs of the pines dance lightly in the wind overhead.  Birds and\nsquirrels ramble aimlessly among the branches searching for food.\n~\nS\n#17239\nA small pine grove.~\nThe serenity of the pine grove calms your anxieties as you venture\ndeeper within.  The heavy undergrowth of the forest once again rises to\nchoke out the pines and block passage to the north, and the back of\na house lies to your east.  The grove continues west and south . . . \nsuddenly, a loud cry captures your attention, and it appears to be coming\nfrom the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nE\npine tree~\nYou're amazed that these little trees do so well in the midst of the\ndark forest.  They can't be over 20 feet tall, and it's almost as if\nmagic protects them from the darkness around them.\n~\nE\nforest vines undergrowth~\nThe forest rises quickly above the grove, the undergrowth rising at its\nfeet to form a wall of vegetation that is clearly impassable.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe inside of the house is dimly lit, but you can clearly make out the\nshapes of two large \"men\" sitting around a table.  You make a mental note\nof the house's location so as not to accidentally wander in on them.\n~\nE\neast house shack~\nThe house to the east appears to be constructed of stone, and is in\nvery good shape.  Vines cover the back wall, but you can make out a window\nhidden behind a patch of flowers.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe soft needles here are not as nice as the ones at the entrance to\nthe grove . . . mushrooms, vines and other offshoots frmo the forest\nfight for a foothold.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy of the neighboring forest towers above the edge of the grove,\nreminding you again of the ominous nature of the entire village.  Once\nagain, life appears almost non-existent overhead . . . though you do feel\nthe odd sensation of being watched . . ..\n~\nS\n#17240\nA small pine grove.~\nThere is a small clearing in the pine forest, and a lone pine tree \nstands in the northwest corner of the grove.  As you peer intently\nup into the branches, you see a large owl's nest perched just out of\nreach.  The forest blocks passage to the north and west, and the rest\nof the pine grove lies east and south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17239\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17241\nE\nwest north forest undergrowth~\nOnce again the forest has pushed so densely against the grove that\npassage is impossible.  It looks pretty spooky anyway . . ..\n~\nE\ntree pine~\nThe pine tree stands alone in the corner of the clearing, as if holding\noff the forest by itself.  It provides a perfect perch for the owl to\nsurvey the grove, and plenty of room to swoop quickly down upon its\nunsuspecting dinner guests.\n~\nE\nnest~\nThe owl's nest looks to be about a yard in width, and is constructed\nof twigs and leaves wedged into a deep hole in the tree.  It sits just\nout of your reach . . . and the tree offers no branches for you to climb.\n~\nE\nskeleton~\nThe skeleton appears to be that of a rat, or perhaps a small cat.  It\nis about the right size for an owl's dinner.  It's best left alone.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe ground is relatively clear here--a perfect area for an owl's\nhunting grounds.  A small skeleton lies half-covered in pine needles,\nbut you see no other signs that anyone has been here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest hangs precariously above the pine grove, drowning out most\nof the light.  Besides the owl's nest, there are few signs of life here.\n~\nS\n#17241\nA small pine grove.~\nThis corner of the pine grove is very pleasant, and is by far the\nbrightest.  The forest closes in to block passage to the west, and adds\nan ominous gloom to an otherwise nice place.  The wall of a stone building\nlies to your south, and the pine grove runs to the east and north.  You\nhear a strange, hair-tingling shriek in the latter direction.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nE\ndown needles~\nThere are signs that others have been here before you.  The needles\nshow places where several others have rested, at least one of whom was\nbleeding . . . the trail of blood leads off to the north.\n~\nE\nstone wall house building~\nThe back of the house is simply a rock wall, offering no windows or\ndoors for passage.\n~\nE\nwest forest undergrowth~\nThough it appears that the forest thins a bit to the west, there's no\nway you're going to get there from here to find out.  It's almost as if\nsomeone has been encouraging the forest to form a wall . . . it's hard\nto believe it could be so consistently unpassable on it's own.\n~\nE\nbirds~\nThe birds appear to be only sparrows, and they're far out of your\nreach.  There's probably a better meal to be had somewhere else.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou spot several birds fluttering around amongst the pines, and hear\nthe distinct sounds of squirrels playing out of sight.\n~\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees provide a nice amount of cover here, and it would be a\nwonderful place to kick back and ponder the mysteries of life . . ..\n~\nS\n#17242\nThe remains of a shack.~\nThis shack has pretty much reached the end of its useful life.  The\nroof has collapsed in upon the interior, and most anything of use was\nlong ago stripped and salvaged.  You can climb across the rubble, where\na small clearing seems to sit in back of the building to the south, or\nexit to the path through town to the north.  To the east lies the exterior\nwall of a sturdy building, and to the west you see a hide-covered hut,\nbut no way to enter it.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nE\neast building wall~\nThe bare face of a stone wall forms the back of the building to the east.\nThere would appear to be no access from this side.\n~\nE\nwest hide hut~\nTo the west you can just make out what looks like an igloo made of\nanimal skins tucked within the trees.  However, you can't tell much more\nthan that from this vantage point.\n~\nE\nrubble~\nThe rubble would appear to be the remains of a rock wall which fell\nvictim to the elements some time ago.  It is now only a waist-high pile\nof rocks and boards.  You should be able to climb over it easily to get\nto the clearing beyond.\n~\nE\ndown~\nGrass and a variety of weeds have started to re-establish themselves now\nthat the shack has collapsed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees have thinned overhead, but the sun isn't at the proper angle\nto reach this particular lot.  Too bad, the grass could use some help.\n~\nS\n#17243\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYour attention is immediately drawn to the hut to the south, which appears\nto be constructed of animal hides and stands out awkwardly from the forest.\nTo your north is the stone wall of an old hut, the entrance of which lies\nfurther to the west.  The edge of town lies to your west, and the trail\neast will take you into the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17247\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\nhut hide~\nFrom the trail, it looks as though the hut is made of a large segment\nof leather pulled taught over some sort of from.  Further inspection\nmight provide more insights.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou are clearly near the western edge of the forest, as the trees become\nmuch thicker, and ominously darker, the further east you look.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-packed and dry.  It looks like many pairs of\nfeet, and in some cases multiple pairs, have used the trail recently.\n~\nE\nwall stone~\nExcept for a few small vines and some patches of fungus, the stone wall\nis bare.  You can tell from the outside that the door to this building is\nthe one just west of here.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nYou'll have to go a little farther west down the trail to see the door\nproperly.\n~\nS\n#17244\nA storage closet.~\nThe closet is very plain.  Several nails have been pounded into the\nwalls to serve as hooks, and the floor is scratched from the occasional\ntrunk that has been dragged in and out.  It is otherwise very clean\nand somewhat secure.  It's value as a hideout might outweigh its\noriginal purpose.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17245\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is simply a series of planks embedded in the ground, but it's\nlevel and dry.  It would certainly be among the cleaner places you've\nrested today . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of the hut appears to be made of planks, sealed here and there\nwith patches of sod.  It's not much, but it would likely keep you dry\nin the rain.\n~\nE\neast north south walls~\nThe walls are bare, but sturdy.\n~\nE\ndoor west~\nThe door separates the closet from the main room of the shack.  When\nclosed, it provides decent privacy.\n~\nS\n#17245\nThe Warrior's Shack.~\nYou have entered a well-kept shack that appears to belong to a warrior\nwho has taken up long-term residence in Shadowvale.  Though plain and\nunfurnished, the stone walls provide protection from the elements and,\nwell, at least the door works.  The trail through town lies to the\nsouth, and a door is set into the eastern wall.\n~\n0 D 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17244\nD2\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17246\nE\nnorth west walls~\nThe stone walls are well-constructed, and on the inside, at least, are\nin good shape.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of this shack actually has shingles, though light shows \nthrough in the corners of the room.  It's better than sleeping in the rain.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in oak planking.  It's worn, but not deteriorating.\nIt's certainly good enough to keep most of the bugs out of your bedroll.\n~\nE\ndoor east~\nThe door to the east isn't as solid as the exterior door, and appears\nto lead to a storage room or closet.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door to the outside is quite sturdy, and will definitely keep out\nwandering fidos and other undesirables.\n~\nS\n#17246\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYou stand at the western-most edge of a small village tucked within\nthe forest.  The town spreads out to the east, hidden beneath the quickly\ndarkening forest.  An air of gloom hangs over the grove, and you see\nlittle movement in the streets.  To your north lies an entrance to\na sturdy stone hut, but a wooden door blocks any view inside.  To your\nsouth is a dilapitated shack--the door is closed, but you can't imagine\nwhy anyone would bother.  The trail leaves town to your west, and leads\ninto the center of town (as well as the deeper forest) to your east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17245\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17248\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17249\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens as it leaves town to the west.  To the east, it becomes\nnarrower as it winds between the scattered buildings and trees.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is open and airy above you, and squirrels frolic among the\nboughs.  You can see that the trees slowly fade to the west, while to the\neast the canopy thickens and eventually fades into darkness.\n~\nE\nsouth shack~\nThe dilapitated shack to the south appears ready to collapse in on\nitself.  The walls are old and rotted, and large chunks of the roof\nare missing.  The well-worn path to the door suggests that someone\nis still using it regularly, despite its condition.\n~\nE\nwooden door~\nIt's a wooden door--your time would be better spent trying to open it.\n~\nE\nnorth stone hut~\nThe sturdy hut is built from cut limestone and looks to be kept up\nregularly.  You judge from the building pattern that it probably also\nextends to the east, but you see no entrance in that direction.  The\nwooden door is closed, but looks like it probably works.\n~\nS\n#17247\nA hut covered in animal hides.~\nHides have been stretched across a frame of bent branches to form a\ndomed hut among the trees.  The floor is clean and dry, and someone\nhas recently been building fires in the center of the room.  A shaft\nof sunlight pierces the hole in the roof which serves as a chimney,\nand casts a dim light about the room.  The doorway to the north leads\nback to the trail.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nstraw pile~\nIt would seem the current occupant is using the pile of straw as a bed.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt has been carefully maintained.  It is smooth\nand, except for a pile of straw in the corner, free of debris.\n~\nE\nhole up~\nYou can just make out the boughs of the trees as the wind blows them\nback and forth above the hut.  The hole is about a dagger's length\nacross--just enough to draw the smoke out, and not enough to let the\nrain in.\n~\nE\nbranches~\nThe branches appear to be taken from willow trees.  About a dozen of\nthem rise around the edge of the cirular shelter, and are tied with\ntwine where they meet at the top.\n~\nE\nhide walls skins~\nThe hides appear to be from a wide variety of animals.  Large skins,\nmost likely from wolves and bears, form the majority of the structure,\nand smaller skins have been used to fill the gaps.  Overall, the work\nis excellent.\n~\nS\n#17248\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17249\nThe trail leading out of Shadowvale.~\nThe trail leads east into a small village hidden within the edge of\nthe forest.  To the west the forest thins and eventually fades altogether.\nSquirrels and other wildlife play in the light cover near the trail, and\nyou can hear the chatter of birds in the surrounding canopy.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail looks well-travelled to the east toward town, but fades here\nand can't be seen to the west.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest thins to the west, but you can't make out the lands beyond.\nThe trail ends here, however, so there can't be too much out there . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the canopy in many places, leaving misty trails\nas it seeks out the ground below.  You notice the eerie contrast with\nthe forest to the east, which quickly becomes dark and menacing.\n~\nE\nnorth south forest~\nThe forest around you consists of random trees scattered among a low\ncovering of bushes and vines.  It has a rather cheerful feel about it,\nand you note a wide range of scents in the air.\n~\nS\n#17250\nA small clearing in the woods.~\nA small clearing has been created just behind the shacks along this\nrow.  Piles of garbage sit rotting along the edge of the forest, which\ncloses quickly in against the southern and western edges of the lot.\nThere are signs of a trail entering the underbrush to the west, but it\nis difficult to make out where it might go.  The back door of a shack\nlies to your east, and the remains of a fallen building lie north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD1\nExit ~\nback door east~\n16387 0 17231\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nE\ndown~\nThe clearing is covered in a soft, green turf.  If it weren't for the\nstink of rotting garbage, it'd be a nice place to rest for awhile.\n~\nE\nup~\nNo trees grow in the lot, and the refreshing glow of sunlight enhances\nthe area.  You can tell from the canopy though that this might be the only\nsunny spot for some distance in any direction.\n~\nE\ntrail west~\nThere appears to be a path leading into the forest at the western edge\nof the clearing, but the undergrowth is so heavy it is hard to be sure.\n~\nE\npile garbage~\nIt looks as if someone has been tossing the remains of meals, and perhaps\nworse, along the edges of this lot.  Even if there was something of value\nburied deep in there, you doubt it's worth enough to dig around and find\nit.\n~\nE\nback door east~\nThe door is simply a variety of random boards and planks tied together\nwith string and vines.  Nice effort, but certainly better at keeping\nout the wind than hearty adventurers like yourself.\n~\nS\n#17251\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail plunges into the forest, and the vegetation immediately\npresses in against you.  It appears that the trail continues south, and\nreturns east to the clearing.\n~\n0 A 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17252\nE\ndown trail~\nThe ground is covered in vegetation, and vines reach out to snag your\nfeet and armor.  The trail is faint, but after a few seconds you can\nsee that it clearly goes south, if anywhere . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest above is so thick that light can hardly penetrate.  The\nlower branches are covered in vines, and you can't see any further into\nthe forest in this direction than in any other.\n~\nE\nwest north forest underbrush~\nThe undergrowth is thick in this part of the forest.  You think the\nbacks of the buildings along the main trail should be to your north, but\nit is impossible to see more than several feet into the vegetation.\nThe trail is the only possible means of passage through this area.\n~\nS\n#17252\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the forest edge.  Vegetation presses in\nfrom the south, east and west preventing further passage.  A strange bush\nprotruding from the forest edge to the west captures your attention.\n~\n0 A 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17253\nE\ndown~\nThick sod, covered in leaves and decaying branches, covers the forest\nfloor.  You feel you should watch carefully where you are walking so\nas not to entangle yourself in the vines.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees grow low over the path, and the vines growing from the\nbranches hang just out of reach.  A wave of claustrophobia overcomes\nyou, and you feel the urge to turn and run.\n~\nE\nsouth east forest underbrush~\nThe underbrush almost reaches out from the forest to draw you in.  You\nhear the cries of a wide variety of wildlife from beyond the edge of the\ntrees, but you can't imagine what would live in such darkness.  You can't,\nthat's for sure . . . you might as well turn around and head back.\n~\nE\nhandle~\nThe handle is too deep in the bush to see.  Perhaps if you opened\nthe bush . . . \n~\nE\nmetal inside~\nThere appears to be a fence inside the bush.  As you investigate further,\nyou notice that the bush gives slightly under your weight.  You feel what\ncould be a handle of some sort . . .\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nAt first glance, the bush appears to be dying.  The leaves have all\ndried out, and the whole thing seems to almost sway and flap in the wind\n . . . almost as if it were hanging.  You see the faint glint of sunlight\nstriking metal deep inside.\n~\nS\n#17253\nThe hidden hut.~\nYou've gained entrance to a hut hidden within the underbrush at the\nedge of the forest.  It is constructed primarily of sod, and has the feel\nof an igloo--but it obviously wasn't built for comfort.  It is clearly\na temporary hideout of some sort, and amenities aren't apparently a\npriority to the owner.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17252\nE\ndown floor~\nSomeone has made an effort to at least pack the dirt on the ground into\nsomething resembling a floor.  Grass still grows in places, but it isn't\ndoing well in the absence of sunlight.\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nFrom the inside, you can see that someone has simply uprooted an\nentire bush and built a wire door frame through the middle.  The bush\nthen hangs from the frame, and from the outside, appears to still be\nhappily anchored in the soil.  You admire the genius that came up with\nthis idea.\n~\nE\n~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\nup branches vines~\nThe branches and vines that form the ceiling provide an interesting\nmaze at which to stare while you lie on your back awaiting sleep.\n~\nE\nwalls west south north sod~\nThe sod was cut from the ground and stacked into piles about 8 feet in\nheight.  A series of branches were added across the top of the room, and\nvines were allowed to grow across them as a \"roof\".  Not exactly the\nbuilding materials you'd choose for a honeymoon suite, but they serve\ntheir current purpose well . . . finding and getting into this hut is\ncertainly a challenge.\n~\nS\n#17254\nA path in the forest.~\nThe forest deepens to the west, and appears nearly impassable.  The trail\ncontinues in that direction though, as well as returning to the east.

You notice an odd \"stillness\" about the trail in\nthat direction.  The forest pushes in from the south and east, preventing\npassage in those directions altogether.  To the north, the forest thins\nconsiderably.\n~\n0 0 3\nH 200 M 200\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17256\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17254\nE\nsouth east forest vegetation~\nYou note that the trees are becoming larger and older as you move to\nthe west.  Thick underbrush and massive vines block passage to the south\nand east, forcing the trail to turn to the west and north.\n~\nE\nup~\nBeams of sunlight burst through the canopy above, giving the forest about\nyou an eerie glow.  You can see that as you move west, the light disappears\ncompletely, and to the east the forest appears to be thinner.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail turns north and west here, forced to change course by the\nthickening underbrush.\n~\nS\n#17256\nThe path into the forest.~\nThe forest rises in a thick wall to the west.  Large vines and thick\nunderbrush provide an eerie backdrop to the deepeing darkness in that\ndirection.  The trail continues south, plunging into the edge of the\ndeeper woods, and to the east leads to a crossroads.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 3510\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nE\nnorth west vines underbrush forest~\nWhile the forest to the east is relatively clear, the forest to the\nwest is a mass of vegetation.  Thick, dark tree trunks rise far above you\nand squeak with a menacing tone as they sway in wind.  Large vines and\nbrambles grow between them, creating an impenetrable mass.  You can't\nimagine what kind of creatures would make their homes here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest seems to lean over you from the west, almost as it if plans\nto engulf you as a lunchtime snack.  The sun still finds the occasional\nhole to poke through here, but you can see it's having much better luck\nto the east.  Perhaps you would too . . ..\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail thins as it enters the forest to the south, but the hard-\npacked dirt suggests that it does, in fact, get travelled.  To the east\nthe trail leads to a crossroads.\n~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nM 0 17204   1 17204  1\t* The mimic\nM 0 17200   2 17205  1\t* the mangy fido\nG 1 3068  -1     \t*   a pair of hard leather

A poorly-built\nshack lies to the north, while a more durable stone hut lies to the south.\nThe buildings continue along the trail ahead to what looks like a\ncrossroads or village square, and the trail leads back east to the dense\nforest.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17206\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17202\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door is made of hardwood planks and sturdy supports.  It would be\na tough one to break down . . . you might want to try just opening it.\n~\nE\nstone hut~\nThe hut to the south is constructed of solid stone walls with a proper,\nand well-maintained, thatch roof.  A solid wood door sits in the wall\ndirectly to your south, and the hut seems to continue to the west, where\nyou spot a window.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail continues through the trees, which are now thinning enough\nfor you to see that it leads to the west through town, and perhaps even\nwidens a little as it goes.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is a poor effort at shelter, and seems to consist of nothing\nmore than boards and branches tied to trees.  A small opening at the front\nserves as a door.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nYou'd have to go farther to the west to look into the window.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy continues to thin as you approach the center of town, and you\ncan tell that it eventually fades to the west.  You see bright shafts of\nsunlight breaking through the canopy in that direction, and the town\nlooks a lot less gloomy.\n~\nS\n#17206\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more that planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.  You might want to use the door to the south to get back on the\ntrail and out of harm's way.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nE\nwalls north east west planks~\nThe planks used to \"make\" the walls vary in size.  They also vary in\ncolor, shape and the means by which they are held together.  It's quite\nthe menagerie of construction methods.  You get the impression that a\nlot of the credit for the fact that the structure is still standing\nshould go to the vines outside, whose roots wrap tightly around anything\nexposed to the outside.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17207\nA large stone hut.~\nThe interior of the hut is dark and damp.  The stone walls are bare on the\ninside, and except for several mats on the floor there is nothing in the\nroom.  You hear voices to the west, and can see from the flickering light\naround the edges of the curtain hanging in the doorway that a fire is\nburning there.  The smell of cooking meat tempts you, but you can also\ngo through the door to the north and get on the main trail.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor wood~\n16387 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17209\nE\ndoor wood~\nThe door to the outside is made of sturdy hardwood planks.  It provides\ngood security, and, unlike most of the doors in this town, seems to have\nactually been made for the doorway it inhabits.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn of clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\ndown floor mat~\nSeveral worn reed mats lie about the floor, apparently serving as beds\nfor the current residents of the hut.\n~\nE\nroof ceiling thatch~\nLarge bundles of reeds, tied with vines, have been piled across a\ncarefully planned set of cross-supports.  This roof surely has no\nproblems with leaks.\n~\nE\nwalls south east stone~\nThe walls are constructed of square limestone blocks, obviously cut\ncarefully to fit.  You're surprised at the effort that went into them,\nand wonder if this building wasn't meant to be something more.\n~\nS\n#17208\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail approaches a small crossroads to the west, and what looks like\nit might be a fountain sits in the midst of the path in that direction.\nTo the east, the trail continues to the forest at the edge of town.  To the\nnorth is a stone building which appears to be a store of some sort, and\nto the south lies a stone hut.  The entrance to the hut is to the east,\nthough the window in front of you seems as if it might allow you to see\ninside.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17210\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nE\nletter sign~\nThe letters are difficult to make out, but with some effort, you can see\nthat the sign reads:  Blacksmith.\n~\nE\nbuilding store~\nThe building to the north looks to be a storefront, though it is in\ngreat disrepair.  The door covering the entrance is old, but appears as\nif it might still work.  As you get closer, you notice the presence of\nfaint lettering painted above the door.\n~\nE\nsouth hut~\nThe walls of the hut are in good shape, and the thick thatch roof\nsuggests some work has been done to keep this building up.  There is a door\ndown the trail to the east which seems to lead inside, and a window set\ninto the wall in front of you.  You think you see the flicker of flames\nthrough the window, but you can't be sure.\n~\nE\ndoor old~\nThe door is worn and weathered, and the hinges a bit rusty, but it\nseems likely you could still open it.\n~\nE\nup trees~\nThe sun fights its way through the boughs above and, when the branches\nget blown just the right way in the wind, the occasional warm ray of light\nreaches your face.  The canopy shows more signs of life as you move farther\nfrom the dense forests to the east.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here, and straightens out as the trees thin.  \nThe ground is a bit wet, which you attribute to the leaky fountain to the\nwest.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is very dirty, but you can make out a dimly-lit room inside\nthe hut.  There seems to be a door on the west side of the room, and\nanother on the east.  The flickering of a small fire draws your attention\nto a small hearth set into the wall.  You aren't sure, but there appears\nto be movement in the shadows.\n~\nS\n#17209\nThe kitchen of a stone hut.~\nThe kitchen of this hut is rather crude, but certainly effective.  A\nsmall hearth is set into the wall, with a variety of racks for hanging\npots and kettles.  A long countertop runs along the opposite wall, with\na series of bins for food storage beneath.  You imagine this building\nmight have once been a small cafe.  A curtain covers the entrance to the\nadjoining room to the east, and another door leads to the west.  A window\nset into the north wall admits just enough light to let you look around.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ncurtain door~\n16387 0 17207\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17214\nE\nsouth wall~\nThe stone walls appear to have once been carefully cut to fit.  Recent\nabuse, most likely in the form of clubs, swords and heads being bashed\ninto them, has seriously altered their appearance.  They're pitted all\nover, and large chunks are missing in several places.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof of the hut is very sturdy, and probably does a nice job of\nkeeping the place dry.\n~\nE\nwindow north~\nThrough the dirty window you can just make out the trail running east\nand west through town to the north of the hut.  Across the street you\nsee another stone building.\n~\nE\ngroove gouge~\nThe gouges look to have been made from stuff being thrown into, or at,\nthe box on a regular basis.  Maybe the stockboy wasn't too careful.\n~\nE\nbox bin~\nThe wooden box shows signs of wear, and has a number of grooves and\ngouges, both inside and out.  It is currently empty, however.\n~\nE\ncountertop~\nThe countertop is constructed of thick planking laid across a frame\nof sturdy posts.  It runs the full length of the wall, and a box has\nbeen built beneath it to serve as a storage bin.\n~\nE\nfire hearth~\nA small fire is burning in the hearth, started perhaps to prepare this\nevening's dinner.  Unfortunately, you don't see dinner itself anywhere.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn from clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\nrack pots kettle~\nA crude iron rack hangs above the fire awaiting a pot to hold over the\nfire.  The pots and kettles appear to be clean and usable, but are empty.\nApparently what you smelled from next door was yesterday's leftovers.\n~\nS\n#17210\nBennie's Blacksmith Shop.~\nYou've entered the interior of what was once clearly a blacksmith shop.\nA large hearth sits in the center of the room, providing access from\nall sides.  Rotted shelves line the walls, and a pair of tongs and a\nbillows lie rotting on the countertop.  Though the place might of once\nbeen quite busy, it appears that its better days are long past.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17208\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17212\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is slowly being overtaken by grass.  You attribute the deep\ndepression near the sliding door to the presence of horses once passing\nin and out for shoeing.  Other than this, the floor is bare--long ago\nvictim to the local scavangers.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nShafts of light pierce the weakened roof in many places, suggesting that\nthis building probably isn't very dry in the rain.  The light casts a dim\naura about the room.\n~\nE\nsliding door~\nThe sliding door to the west provides a wide berth to the street when\nopen.  It would appear that this is where Bennie once brought local\nhorses in and out of the building for shoeing.\n~\nE\neast wall~\nThe remains of a long countertop and storage shelves line the east wall.\n~\nE\nhearth~\nA circular hearth sits in the center of the room, built upon a stone\nfoundation.  The interior shows the scars of many fires, and the large\nchunks of rock missing around the edges suggest that perhaps it has\nbeen hit with a hammer repeatedly in the past.  The remains of several\nsmall fires sit in the bottom of the hearth, but you can tell it has\nbeen some time since it hosted a real blacksmith's furnace.\n~\nE\ncounter countertop~\nAt one time, a long countertop served as a workspace, running the entire\nlength of the east wall.  Like the shelves above it, though, it has been\nstripped of all useful pieces, and consists now of nothing more than a\nrotting frame.\n~\nE\nshelf shelves~\nLong, sturdy shelves at one time covered most of the interior walls in this\nbuilding, providing a massive amount of storage space.  Most of the wood\nhas long ago rotted or been removed for use elsewhere in town, though, and\nnot much remains but the frames.\n~\nE\nbillows~\nThere's not much left of the billows but the wooden frame.  It looks\nas though a leather \"bag\" for holding air might once have been attached,\nbut it has long ago rotted.  The only thing these would be useful for\nnow would be the wood scraps.\n~\nE\ntongs~\nThe tongs are old and rusted, and show the wear and tear of being thrusted\ninto the scorching flames time and time again.  Unfortunately, they aren't\nin any condition to salvage.\n~\nS\n#17211\nCrossroads at the center of town.~\nYou stand at the center of town, where the trail forms a sort of a\ncrossroad.  To the north you see a \"street\" that ends in a dead end.  The\nbuildings along each side appear to be nicer than those in the rest of\ntown.  The trail continues east and west through town, and another\nleads south, running between more buildings before it eventually leaves\ntown.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nE\ntrail~\nThe trail continues east and west to the edges of town at least.  To the\nsouth it widens a bit and appears to eventually become a road.\n~\nE\nstreet~\nThe street runs north and comes to an end at a building.  Other\nbuildings line the east and west sides.  It looks a little more promising\nthan the rest of town, and perhaps like it might have been the first\npart of town constructed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy has thinned considerably, and you can see now that the forest\nthins overhead to the west and the south.  Sunlight sneaks through in\nplaces, casting an eerie light over this part of Shadowvale.\n~\nE\ndown mud~\nYuck.  The mud has covered your boots, and you can feel the water seeping\ninto your socks . . ..\n~\nS\n#17212\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to a dead end at the wall of a stone\nbuilding several doors down.  This section of town looks somewhat more\npermanent than the rest, and the buildings are all of stone.  A wooden\ndoor leads to the building to the west, and a large sliding door provides\naccess to the stone building to the east.  To the south lies the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17210\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17217\nE\nslinding door~\nThe large wooden door hangs from a metal rail, and slides to one side\nto provide access to the building.  It would appear to be some sort\nof loading dock, or perhaps a stable door.\n~\nE\nwest structure~\nFour sturdy stone walls uphold the frame of a very old building, yet\nyou can see that the roof is in serious disrepair.  Planks have been\nstripped from the windows and awnings, most likely for use elsewhere in\ntown.  The door is battered, but is closed and probably rusted shut.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy above is much lighter, and you see small patches of sky\nbetween the boughs.  The forest thickens to the east and north, hanging\ndrearily over the edges of the village.  To the south and east it thins,\nand it looks as though the sun may actually be shining through.\n~\nE\ndown trail ground~\nThe trail here is heavily travelled.  It looks like most of the traffic\nleads to the huts at the end, as weeds grow freely along the rest of the\nbuildings.\n~\nE\neast building~\nThe building to the east looks to have once been a store of some sort.\nThe door on this side of the building is large, and slides to one side.\nIt looks like it might have been a loading dock, or maybe even a small\nstable.  A hitching post runs along the side of the building.\n~\nE\npost hitching~\nA worn branch has been mounted across two posts alongside the building.\nAt one time, judging from the considerable wear, many horses were tied\nhere on a regular basis.\n~\nS\n#17213\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail wanders west from the crossroads through another section of\ntown.  The walls of the buildings to the north and south of the crossroads\nlie to each side.  Several other buildings line the trail before it\neventually leads to the edge of town.  To the east lie the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy thins the further west you go, until it eventually\ndisappears somewhere beyond the edge of town.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is still narrow and winding along this stretch of town, but\nit would appear that it widens a bit to the west.\n~\nE\nnorth south walls~\nThe buildings to each side of the trail are made of stone and allow\nno access from this side.  You note that it looks like the roof is\ncollapsing a little on the building to the north.\n~\nS\n#17214\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail passes between two stone structures as it continues north\nand south through town.  To your north lies a small crossroads, and to\nthe south the trail leads to the edge of town.  The hut to the east is\nin good shape, but a door prevents you from seeing inside.  To the west\nlies a stone shanty.  A curtain made of a thick hide is pulled tightly\nacross the doorway, and strange markings are scrawled in red along each\nside of the entrance.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17209\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17228\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here and takes on the appearance of an actual\nroad.  It looks as though this southern route gets used often--the dirt\nis well-packed and the path free from grass.\n~\nE\nmarkings red sign~\nThe markings are in a script you don't recognize, but they have a\ndecidely evil feeling about them.  You get the impression the paint used\nto make them was probably blood . . ..\n~\nE\ncurtain hide~\nThe curtain is simply the hide of a large animal, perhaps an oxen or\nwater buffalo.  It's secured from the top, and seems to be tied loosely\nat the bottom as well.  You should be able to open it, though.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy continues to thin to the south, and the forest retreats\nsomewhat behind the buildings.  It feels a lot less enclosed here.  The\nsun breaks through the trees to warm your face, and a gentle breeze blows\nfrom the south.\n~\nE\nhut~\nThe hut is a fine, stone building.  The exterior masonry is of high \nquality, and the roof is in good shape.  You note a small quantity of smoke\nwafting from the top of the chimney.\n~\nE\nshanty~\nThe shanty is built of loosely-fitted stone which appears to be more\n\"piled\" than \"fitted\".  You can see that the roof is old, but see no\nmajor holes.  It might be a good place to rest . . . if it isn't inhabited.\n~\nS\n#17215\nThe remains of a shack.~\nYou stand in the midst of a deteriorating shack.  It appears as if it was\nonce attached to the store to the south, perhaps as workspace.  Shelves\nline the stone walls, and an old anvil stands in the corner.  The wall to\nthe west is almost entirely collapsed, providing access to the trail\noutside.  To the south a door connects to the storefront.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17210\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nLittle remains of the roof but the rafters, which are now largely\nover-grown with vines.  With a little work, you could find a sheltered\ncorner to rest in.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nGrass has started to re-take the ground inside the hut.  There is still\na lot of bare ground, and it appears as though someone has been sleeping\nhere regularly.\n~\nE\nnorth east wall shelves shelf~\nSturdy shelves have been built directly into the stone walls, providing\na significant amount of storage space.  They have long been stripped of\nanything of value they might once have held, and are home to only dust\nnow.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door isn't too sturdy, and was clearly designed to be an interior\nfixture.  It appears to be in good working condition.\n~\nS\n#17216\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to an end soon at the wall of a stone hut.\nTo the south, it leads back to the center of town.  An empty doorway leads\nto the building to the west, and the wall of the building to the east has\ncollapsed, allowing you access.  The prospects look best to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17219\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17218\nE\ndown trail~\nIt doesn't look much like anyone ever stops here.  The trail is well\nworn running north and south, but weeds cover the ground to the east and\nwest.  You note a slight rise as the trail runs north.\n~\nE\nup~\nIt's amazing how fast the canopy thickens, and a dull grey has set in\nabout you.  You can see that the edge of the forst lies just beyond the\nbuildings in all directions, and you're surprised that is hasn't yet\nengulfed the whole town.\n~\nE\ncollapsed wall rubble~\nThe remains of the wall consist of large stones and mortar.  It won't\ntake much effort to climb over it.\n~\nS\n#17217\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17218\nA sturdy lean-to.~\nAll that remains of the once proud stone building that stood here is the\nfront wall.  The back wall is partially collapsed, and is now a waist-high\npile of rubble.  Some enterprising resident has constructed a roof between\nthe two walls by laying branches and reeds across a series of slim poles.\nIt's not pretty, but it's clean and looks rather comfortable.  The trail\nlies to the east.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nnorth south~\nThe walls of the neighboring building are covered with scattered vines\nand large patches of mold.  Not very attractive, but interesting . . ..\n~\nE\nbranches reed roof ceiling~\nMost of the original branches used to create the ceiling are long-dead\nand starting to rot.  The mass of vegetation from the forest beyond has\ngrown over much of it, though, and has nicely filled gaps as they formed.\n~\nE\nrubble back~\nThe pile of rubble, which consists of mostly large blocks of stone,\nstands about chest-high to a dwarf.  You'd probably have to crawl to\nactually get back to it . . . and it certainly doesn't look like it's\nworth the effort.\n~\nS\n#17219\nThe end of the dead-end street.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the wall of a large stone structure.  It's\nhard to tell for sure, but you'd guess that the building to the north is\npart of either the building to the east or west, or maybe both.  A sturdy\noak door covers the entrance of the shack to the east, and a strong, solid\niron door blocks the entrance to the hut to your west.  You can try your\nluck with either of those, or take the trail back to the south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17220\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17223\nE\nup~\nYou feel claustrophobic beneath the shadow of the overhanging trees\nalong this end of the street.  The owners of these homes obviously didn't\nchoose the location for the wealth of sunlight it offers.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail branches neatly to the left and right to the entrances of the\ntwo buildings.  It would seem that the residents use it a lot.\n~\nE\nnorth wall~\nIt's as good a wall as you've ever seen, but that's about it.  It looks\nlike someone might even be clearing the vines off of it on occasion.\n~\nE\nsturdy oak~\nThe door is made of heavy oak planks that bear the scars of many seasons.\nIt looks like it might bear the scars of a few swordfights as well.  It's\nno worse for the wear, though, and if it's locked you won't likely be\ngetting in without a key.\n~\nE\niron~\nThis huge door is constructed of solid iron, decorated with the occasional\nrivet to hold the hinges and latch.  Considering that it's attached to a\nwindowless stone building, you imagine it might once have been a bank or\nsome other important structure.\n~\nS\n#17220\nLiving room of a small house.~\nYou can see, now that you are inside, that this shack is actually more\nof a home.  Sparse furnishings litter the room, and a picture hangs on the\nwall above a small fireplace.  It's actually rather cozy.  The front\ndoor leads back to the trail, and another door leads north to an adjoining\nroom.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17221\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17219\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nThis house has a proper roof, with relatively new planking serving to\nkeep the elements at bay.  You venture a guess that someone probably\nlives here regularly.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is nothing but packed and swept dirt, but it has aged well\nand is very clean.  You're surprised, in fact, at how clean this whole\nplace is.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls of cut stone are clean and free of the mold you see growing\non other buildings in Shadowvale.  The more you look it over, the more\nyou like this place.\n~\nE\npicture~\nA drawing of an ugly giant in a crude wood frame hangs slightly askew\non the wall.  The inscription below reads \"Brutus\".  You wonder if it's\ntrue that a mother always thinks her child is cute . . . and, if so, just\nwhat Brutus' mother might look like . . ..\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nA small stone hearth set into the stone wall flickers brightly from the\nsmall fire within.  The rack inside suggests it might also be used for\ncooking as well.\n~\nS\n#17221\nBrutus' Guest Room.~\nThis room is nicely furnished with a bed, a small nightstand and a desk.\nAgain, it is spotless.  You realize now that this is probably the guest\nquarters for the larger house across the street to the west.  This looks\nlike it would be a nice place to rest, or the door to the south will\ntake you back to the living room.\n~\n0 D 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17220\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof in this room is the same as that in the adjoining room, and it\nseems to be connected to the building next door.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor here is well-kept as well.  A nice rug made from the skin of\nsome unknown animal lies alongside the bed, and there's not a dust ball\nto be found.\n~\nE\nbed~\nThe bed is nothing but a simple cot, but it looks plenty comfortable.\n~\nE\nrug skin~\nThe hide is a dark black in color, with thick, coarse hair.  If pressed\nfor an answer, you'd guess it was from a large bear.\n~\nE\nnight stand table~\nA small wooden table serves as a nightstand next to the bed.  An oil\nlamp, built into the center of the table, provides light for the room.\n~\nE\noil lamp~\nIt's a very simple lamp, but it's unique in that it's somehow fixed\nto the table.  It's much to awkward to be of use anywhere else, and\nserves its purpose here very well.\n~\nE\nwalls north west east~\nThe stone walls are almost polished from constant brushing and cleaning.\nYou're impressed at the effort put into the upkeep of this place,\nespecially when you consider the neighborhood.\n~\nS\n#17222\nInside Windrunner's Crystal Ball~\nYou find yourself suspended in the air amidst a kaleidoscope of swirling\nmist.  After a moment, you realize you have been transferred to the inside\nof Windrunner's Crystal Ball--where he puts imputent mortals he needs to\nattend to . . ..  You feel it would be best to wait and see what he wants.\n~\n0 CDKNT 9\nO windrunner~\nE\nmist swirling~\nThe mist swirls about you in a fantastic variety of colors.  You find the\neffect almost mesmerizing.\n~\nS\n#17223\nThe entrance to Brutus' house.~\nYou've entered a small room that serves as the foyer for a rather\nlarge hut.  Actually, it's almost a house.  Several pairs of boots\nare lined neatly along the wall, and above them a series of hooks\nwait patiently for someone to hang a coat on them.  Other than this, the\nroom is bare.  You hear voices coming from the adjoining room to the\nnorth, and an iron door leads east.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17224\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17219\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe sturdy roof is constructed of heavy planking across a timber frame.\nFrom the looks of it, this house was built to endure.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor, though generally free of debris, is a bit muddy.  You hope it\ndoesn't mess up your nice boots.\n~\nE\nwest south wall~\nThe walls are made of large stone blocks, cut to fit tightly.  They are\nworn smooth with age, but remain sturdy.  Spikes have been driven into\nthem in various places to serve as hangers.\n~\nE\nspike hanger~\nIt's your basic metal spike . . . and it's driven securely into the wall.\n~\nE\niron door~\nThe heavy iron door looks a lot less imposing from the inside than it\ndid from the trail.  In fact, you're guessing it isn't solid at all, and\nis probably just a facade to fool the local \"wildlife\".\n~\nE\nboots~\nThe boots are smelly and worn, and you decide quickly you don't really\nwant to examine them further . . . ..\n~\nS\n#17224\nBrutus' Waiting Room.~\nYou are in what appears to be a waiting room, or perhaps a common room,\nfor the larger house about you.  The room is bare except for three logs\nthat serve as chairs and a picture on the wall.  A torch affixed to the\nwall provides enough light for you to see back into the entryway to the\nsouth, but, strangely, you see no other doors.  You could have sworn that\nfrom the outside this place looked a lot bigger . . ..\n  Maybe you were wrong.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17225\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17223\nE\ntorch~\nIt's a simple torch, and it's secured to the wall . . . .\n~\nE\npicture~\nA charcoal sketch of a giant, who appears to be a thief, adorns the\neast wall.  It's not life-size, but it's at least four feet in height.\nThe word \"Brutus\" is written along the bottom of the sketch.  You're\ncertain that Brutus isn't the type of guy you'd want to invite to your\nMom's house for dinner . . ..\n~\nE\nwest north wall~\nThe walls, though clean, are unadorned.  Someone must have figured they\nwere working hard enough just holding up the ceiling.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling in this room takes on a slight A-Frame appearance.  You\njudge from its construction that this room was built sometime before,\nand in a much better fashion, than the entryway to the south.\n~\nS\n#17225\nBrutus' bedroom.~\nYou've entered Brutus' private sanctuary.  A small desk sits in the corner,\nand is covered in slips of paper and ledgers.  Apparently Brutus is the\nhead honcho in these parts.  A bedroll is unrolled in front of the hearth,\nwhere a small fire warms the room.  You can exit to the west through the\nsecret door, or another door will take you north.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17226\nD3\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17224\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16451 0 11185\nE\nsecret picture~\nTo the west a hole has been roughly hewn into the wall, and you can see\nthat it's been covered with a crudely fashion door to which the picture\nwas then mounted.  Very ingenious.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt is clean, except for small piles of wood\nscraps around the hearth.  The bedroll occupies a corner of the room.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is constructed of spaced planks with wood shingles laid over\nthem.  It would seem that this isn't the orginal roof, and that perhaps\nBrutus had some work done recently.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls are made of stone and mortar.  They're discolored with age,\nbut basically in good shape.\n~\nE\nbedroll~\nThe bedroll is nothing but an old, ratty blanket, and you imagine it's\nprobably the source fo the horrible smell in the room.\n~\nE\nhearth fire~\nA small hearth is set into the wall, and a fire has recently been started.\nIt looks like Brutus was settling in for the evening.\n~\nE\nslips paper ledger~\nSeveral slips marked \"I.O.U.\" lay scattered about a large ledger.  In it\nBrutus seems to be tracking his income.  It looks like he's not only\ntrafficking in stolen merchandise, but collecting \"taxes\" from the local\nresidents as well.  From what you know about numbers, Brutus appears to\nbe doing very nicely for himself.\n~\nE\ndesk~\nIt's a small, simple desk.  It's made of wood, with a stone top.  There\nare holes in the front where drawers used to be, but Brutus seems to have\nfound little use for them.\n~\nS\n#17226\nBrutus' closet.~\nThis small closet is where Brutus probably keeps his inventory.  Too bad\nfor you his stock seems to be depleted.  The door to the south takes you\nback to the main bedroom.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17225\nD5\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17227\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling of the closet slopes steeply as it's near the edge of the\nhut.  Other than a few rope marks where someone seems to have hung something\nheavy, there's little of interest up there.\n~\nE\nnorth west east walls~\nThe closet has the same stone walls as the rest of the hut . . . what\ndid you expect?\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the closet isn't as clean as the floor of the room outside.\nIn fact, it looks a bit like the dirt has been recently disturbed . . ..\n~\nS\n#17227\nBrutus' secret storage room.~\nThat Brutus, he's a pretty smart guy.  The room has been dug beneath\nthe closet, and is rather crude.  It's big enough to store quite a bit\nof illegal merchandise in, though--even if it doesn't stay very clean.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD4\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17226\nE\nnorth south east west down walls dirt~\nThe walls are dirt, and they aren't very well-supported.  Little bits\nhave caved in here and there, and in several spots it looks like sharp\nweapons, maybe spears, were stuck into the walls for storage.  You wonder\nhow many good rains it will take until this whole end of the house sinks\ninto the ground.\n~\nE\nup secret~\nYou can see from below that the secret door is made from thick planks,\nand is laid across the top of the hole.  Brutus made it thick enough to\nseem real when he closed it and spread the dirt over it--but he just\nain't as smart as you, is he?\n~\nS\n#17228\nThe Cleric's Shanty.~\nThe small altar in the corner suggests that this shack is the home of\nthe local priest.  Other than the altar and a small cot, the room is bare\nof furnishings and possessions.

It would also seem\nthat they have tracked all sorts of dirt and other gross things in with\nthem.  You can see why the priest made the cot.\n~\nE\ncot bed~\nA simple cot, consisting of a board laid across to pieces of firewood,\nsits in the corner of the shack.  It looks really uncomfortable, but\nyou could see the advantages of it over, say, sleeping on the floor.\n~\nE\ndoor curtain hide~\nThe door to the shack consists of a simple hide nail to the upper\ncorners.  Apparently the priest trusts his clientele a little more\nthat you would.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is made of randomly over-laid planks.  The gaps\nare plugged with rags and other assorted materials, and the effort looks\nto be mildly successful.\n~\nE\nnorth west south walls~\nThe walls of the shack are simply planks, coated with a thin film of\nwhat looks like mud.  If it was an attempt at plaster, it was a very bad\none.  They do serve to keep the elements at bay, however . . ..\n~\nS\n#17229\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail continues north and south through Shadowvale.  To the north\nyou see a crossroads and what appears to be a fountain.  To the south,\nthe trail becomes a road out of town.

A flimsy door has\nbeen set into the entrance, and a small window sits off to one side of\nthe door.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the trees above in various places, dispelling\nsome of the eerie shadows from the trees above.  This place is still\ndefinitely on the wierd side of creepy, though.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is covered in dirt.  As you wipe a spot clean, you note that\nthe curtains are drawn and you can't see in anyway.\n~\nE\ndoor flimsy~\nThe door most likely keeps out nothing but the rain.  Still, it'd be\neasier to open it than to kick it in . . ..\n~\nS\n#17230\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more than planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.

They are spotted with pieces of cloth, hide and anything\nelse that was available to keep out the rain.\n~\nE\nnorth east south walls~\nThe walls, such as they are, are a conglomeration of materials put\ntogether as availability and need dictated.  \"Mess\" is the first word\nthat comes to mind.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe ground is covered in heavily-matted grass, most of which is clinging\nto life.  It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17231\nThe common shack.~\nThis well-maintained shack seems to serve as a common home to a variety\nof Shadowdale's residents.  Several bedrolls cover the floor, and gear\nof all kinds sits about the room.  You get the feeling, however, that the\nresidents wouldn't be ideal roommates . . ..

Not \nmuch, but it's a dry place to sleep.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is mostly branches woven into a tight sheet.\nYou get the feeling it probably leaks when it rains.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe doors of this shack are simply weather-worn planks tied together\nalong cross-supports.  You could probably put your fist through them if\nyou had to, but it would be easier just to open them . . .\n~\nE\nnorth south wall~\nThe walls of the shack are simple, unadorned planks, many of which seem\nto have come from other buildings . . ..\n~\nE\ngear~\nA variety of gear in states of general mis-use lie about the room.  While\nsome of it may once have been useful, it's all junk now.\n~\nE\nbed bedrolls~\nSeveral piles of hides lie scattered about the room serving as beds.\nThey look as if they are used regularly.\n~\nS\n#17232\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail winds between two more buildings before it leads south out of\ntown.  As it leaves town, the trail leads slowly down into a wide valley.\nThe trees continue to thin in that direction, and you can't be sure, but\nyou think you see the glint of sunlight reflecting off water far down in\nthe valley.  The trail leads north back into town.  To the west are the\ncharred remains of a burned-out building, and to the east a sturdy, well-\nbuilt shack.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17233\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17235\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17234\nE\nshack hut east~\nThe hut to the east is constructed mostly of stone.  \"Patches\" of planks,\nmortar, branches and vines cover holes where larger stones have broken\nloose from the foundation.  The repairs look almost as sturdy as the\nremaining foundation, if not moreso.  It's clearly an old building, but\nsomeone is making an effort to keep it well-maintained.\n  A solid oak door is set into the doorway, blocking your view inside.\n~\nE\nvine patch mortar branch~\nSomeone seems to have patched holes in the foundation of the hut with\na mixture of muddy mortar and branches.  Vines have taken root, providing\nan overlying web of flora.  The patches give the hut a very \"earthy\"\nappearance, almost like a large, moss-covered rock with a nice patch\nof sod growing on top.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is well-trodden here, and it appears many pairs of boots have\nmade the journey south.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun struggles to break through the canopy here, and it appears to\nbe having much more success to the south.  You see birds among the boughs\nof the oaks again, and the chatter of squirrels filters down from far\nabove.\n~\nE\ndoor oak plank~\nThe door to this hut has been cut from a single width of hard oak\nplanking.  It looks very secure, which is good, but rare, in this\nneighborhood.  If it's locked, it would probably be easier to cut a\nhole in the wall than to break it down.\n~\nS\n#17233\nA well-built hut.~\nYou have entered a very comfortable shack.  Though the only furniture\nis a bed in one corner, the shack appears to have been recently cleaned.\nThe walls are solid, and the roof is strong enough to keep out the rain.\nWhat a wonderful place to hide away and rest.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17232\nE\noak plank~\nThe door looks as solid from the inside as it did from outside.  You\nadmire the beautiful grain of the wood . . .\n~\nE\nup~\nThe hut has a sod roof, supported by long, straight limbs culled from\nthe surrounding forest.  Someone did a very nice job of building it.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor of the hut is basically hard-packed dirt.  However, it's\npacked very well, and is almost as solid as stone.\n~\nE\nwalls east north south~\nThe walls of the hut consist of a waist-high stone foundation and smooth\nplanks above that.  They are entirely bare, and could use some decoration.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe door looks just as good inside, and is in very good shape.  If you\nwere to close it, it would probably keep unwanted characters out.\n~\nS\n#17234\nThe remains of a burned building.~\nYou stand amidst the charred ruins of what once might have been a very\nnice shack.  There certainly was a lot of wood in it, as the ashes are\nknee deep and charcoal beams still attempt to hold a roof that no longer\nexists.  You might find something if you rummage, but the place looks\nlike it's been well-scavanged.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\nvegetation forest vines~\nBranches from the forest beyond have grown through the remaining wall\nsupports, protruding into the room.  Large vines have used the branches\nto bridge their way in as well, and are slowly overtaking the area.  You\nare amazed at the resilience of the forest behind the building, and can't\neven imagine how horrible it would be to get stuck in it.\n~\nE\nashes ruins~\nDeep piles of gray ashes, matted into flat mounds by wind and rain,\nprovide an eerie backdrop for the grim black beams which rise like the\ntrees on some lost desert plain.  This place is creepy, even by local\nstandards.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest has already begun to reclaim the back wall of the house.  The\nvines have made themselves at home on the remaining wall supports, and\nhave created an impassable wall of vegetation.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nA short stone foundation survived on the southern side of the lot, \ndefiantly supporting the last remains of the only thing that can be clearly\nidentified as a wall.  Through the remains you can see that the forest\nappears to thin to the south, and you see the trail leading south into\nthe woods just in front of the building.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nThe owners of the building to the north seem to have salvaged a lot of\nthe useful materials from this site, and used them to re-build their\nsouthern wall.  They didn't do a very good job, though, and none of the\npieces fit together.  Cracks and holes appear all over.\n~\nE\nhole crack~\nYou can make out faint shapes inside the shack.  It's too dark to be\nsure, but judging from the whispering and sounds of shuffling, it sounds\nlike the residents might be home . . . and there's more than one person\nat home.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe gray ashes are a little damp, and are making a mess of your boots.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is much thinner here than at the northern edges of town, and\nthe occasional ray of sun sneaks through.  It appears that the trees\ncontinue to thin to the south.\n~\nS\n#17235\nA trail leading south out of town.~\nYou stand on the southern edge of the small village of Shadowvale.  The\ntown, which spreads out to your north, has a dark and menacing feel about\nit--even here you feel many eyes watching you.  The road continues north\ninto town, or south to the thinner forest and, eventually, foreign realms.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17232\nE\ndown trail road~\nThe road is clear and well-marked as it leaves town to the south.  To\nthe north, it appears to lead into the heart of the village.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe thin forest to the west holds little of interest for you, though you\ndo see the remains of a burned-out building to the west of your trail--\nright on the edge of the approaching village.\n~\nE\neast~\nYou see a shack sitting along the east side of the road just north of here,\nmarking the entrance to a village.  The forest is just thin enough that\nyou could leave the trail without getting too horribly lost, but you see\nnothing of interest that would justify the effort.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun beams down upon you brightly as you look up to see squirrels\nplaying among the trees.

An empty lot lies to your north, and you can see\na small grove of pine trees lying just beyond.  To your south are the\nremains of an old shack.  The trail to the west leads to the edge of town,\nand there appears to be a crossroads further into town to the east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17237\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is almost clear at this spot.

It might still\nprovide shelter . . . if you can wedge yourself into a dry corner.  The\ndoorway is empty, the door long-ago stolen for some other housing project.\n~\nS\n#17237\nA campsite in an empty lot.~\nThis vacant lot has been used as a campsite so many times that it has\ntaken on a permanent appearance.  The remains of several fires are\nscattered about the site, and a pine grove that begins on the north\nend of the lot provides nice cover for sleeping.  You can go into the\ngrove to your north, or to the trail through town to the south.

You can make out a clearing to the north in the pine\ngrove, and taller weeds along the walls on each side of the lot provide\nnice protection from the wind.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest has thinned to only scattered trees, and the sun beams down\nupon the lot.  Shade can be gained under the pines to the north, and you\ncan see the forest rising above the far side of the grove.\n~\nE\neast west wall~\nA barrier of weeds and shrubs rings the lot along the edges of the\nneighboring buildings.  The walls appear to be solid and offer no access\nto the inside of either structure.\n~\nE\ncampfire fire~\nSeveral blackened circles surrounded with stones are scattered about\nthe lot.  Half-burned logs, apparently from the pine forest, lie rotting\naround the edges of each site.\n~\nS\n#17238\nA small pine grove.~\nYou have wandered into a small pine grove tucked away behind the homes\nin this area.  The underbrush has been tamed in this clearing, and the\nfresh scent of the small pines is quite refreshing.  The grove continues\nto your north and west.  To your east lies the back wall of a shack, and\nto the south a campsite.

They provide\nnice shelter for the grove, though they aren't much for climbing.\n~\nE\nwall shack east~\nThe wall of the shack is overgrown with flowery vines.  There do not\nappear to be any windows or other distinguishing features.\n~\nE\nflowery vines~\nThe vines appear to be from the morning glory family.  They cover the\nwall in thick patterns, sprouting patches of beautiful purple teacup\nshaped flowers here and there.  Insects and small birds play contentedly\nin the cover they provide.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe bed of pine needles which covers the ground is quite thick.  There\nare patches here and there where piles of needles have been gathered, most\nlikely for use in building fire.  The softness of the ground is a welcome\ntreat for your aching feet.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe boughs of the pines dance lightly in the wind overhead.  Birds and\nsquirrels ramble aimlessly among the branches searching for food.\n~\nS\n#17239\nA small pine grove.~\nThe serenity of the pine grove calms your anxieties as you venture\ndeeper within.  The heavy undergrowth of the forest once again rises to\nchoke out the pines and block passage to the north, and the back of\na house lies to your east.  The grove continues west and south . . . \nsuddenly, a loud cry captures your attention, and it appears to be coming\nfrom the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nE\npine tree~\nYou're amazed that these little trees do so well in the midst of the\ndark forest.

You make a mental note\nof the house's location so as not to accidentally wander in on them.\n~\nE\neast house shack~\nThe house to the east appears to be constructed of stone, and is in\nvery good shape.  Vines cover the back wall, but you can make out a window\nhidden behind a patch of flowers.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe soft needles here are not as nice as the ones at the entrance to\nthe grove . . . mushrooms, vines and other offshoots frmo the forest\nfight for a foothold.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy of the neighboring forest towers above the edge of the grove,\nreminding you again of the ominous nature of the entire village.

It looks pretty spooky anyway . . ..\n~\nE\ntree pine~\nThe pine tree stands alone in the corner of the clearing, as if holding\noff the forest by itself.  It provides a perfect perch for the owl to\nsurvey the grove, and plenty of room to swoop quickly down upon its\nunsuspecting dinner guests.\n~\nE\nnest~\nThe owl's nest looks to be about a yard in width, and is constructed\nof twigs and leaves wedged into a deep hole in the tree.  It sits just\nout of your reach . . . and the tree offers no branches for you to climb.\n~\nE\nskeleton~\nThe skeleton appears to be that of a rat, or perhaps a small cat.  It\nis about the right size for an owl's dinner.  It's best left alone.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe ground is relatively clear here--a perfect area for an owl's\nhunting grounds.  A small skeleton lies half-covered in pine needles,\nbut you see no other signs that anyone has been here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest hangs precariously above the pine grove, drowning out most\nof the light.  Besides the owl's nest, there are few signs of life here.\n~\nS\n#17241\nA small pine grove.~\nThis corner of the pine grove is very pleasant, and is by far the\nbrightest.  The forest closes in to block passage to the west, and adds\nan ominous gloom to an otherwise nice place.  The wall of a stone building\nlies to your south, and the pine grove runs to the east and north.  You\nhear a strange, hair-tingling shriek in the latter direction.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nE\ndown needles~\nThere are signs that others have been here before you.  The needles\nshow places where several others have rested, at least one of whom was\nbleeding . . . the trail of blood leads off to the north.\n~\nE\nstone wall house building~\nThe back of the house is simply a rock wall, offering no windows or\ndoors for passage.\n~\nE\nwest forest undergrowth~\nThough it appears that the forest thins a bit to the west, there's no\nway you're going to get there from here to find out.  It's almost as if\nsomeone has been encouraging the forest to form a wall . . . it's hard\nto believe it could be so consistently unpassable on it's own.\n~\nE\nbirds~\nThe birds appear to be only sparrows, and they're far out of your\nreach.  There's probably a better meal to be had somewhere else.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou spot several birds fluttering around amongst the pines, and hear\nthe distinct sounds of squirrels playing out of sight.\n~\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees provide a nice amount of cover here, and it would be a\nwonderful place to kick back and ponder the mysteries of life . . ..\n~\nS\n#17242\nThe remains of a shack.~\nThis shack has pretty much reached the end of its useful life.  The\nroof has collapsed in upon the interior, and most anything of use was\nlong ago stripped and salvaged.  You can climb across the rubble, where\na small clearing seems to sit in back of the building to the south, or\nexit to the path through town to the north.  To the east lies the exterior\nwall of a sturdy building, and to the west you see a hide-covered hut,\nbut no way to enter it.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nE\neast building wall~\nThe bare face of a stone wall forms the back of the building to the east.\nThere would appear to be no access from this side.\n~\nE\nwest hide hut~\nTo the west you can just make out what looks like an igloo made of\nanimal skins tucked within the trees.  However, you can't tell much more\nthan that from this vantage point.\n~\nE\nrubble~\nThe rubble would appear to be the remains of a rock wall which fell\nvictim to the elements some time ago.  It is now only a waist-high pile\nof rocks and boards.  You should be able to climb over it easily to get\nto the clearing beyond.\n~\nE\ndown~\nGrass and a variety of weeds have started to re-establish themselves now\nthat the shack has collapsed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees have thinned overhead, but the sun isn't at the proper angle\nto reach this particular lot.  Too bad, the grass could use some help.\n~\nS\n#17243\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYour attention is immediately drawn to the hut to the south, which appears\nto be constructed of animal hides and stands out awkwardly from the forest.\nTo your north is the stone wall of an old hut, the entrance of which lies\nfurther to the west.  The edge of town lies to your west, and the trail\neast will take you into the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17247\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\nhut hide~\nFrom the trail, it looks as though the hut is made of a large segment\nof leather pulled taught over some sort of from.  Further inspection\nmight provide more insights.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou are clearly near the western edge of the forest, as the trees become\nmuch thicker, and ominously darker, the further east you look.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-packed and dry.  It looks like many pairs of\nfeet, and in some cases multiple pairs, have used the trail recently.\n~\nE\nwall stone~\nExcept for a few small vines and some patches of fungus, the stone wall\nis bare.  You can tell from the outside that the door to this building is\nthe one just west of here.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nYou'll have to go a little farther west down the trail to see the door\nproperly.\n~\nS\n#17244\nA storage closet.~\nThe closet is very plain.  Several nails have been pounded into the\nwalls to serve as hooks, and the floor is scratched from the occasional\ntrunk that has been dragged in and out.  It is otherwise very clean\nand somewhat secure.  It's value as a hideout might outweigh its\noriginal purpose.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17245\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is simply a series of planks embedded in the ground, but it's\nlevel and dry.  It would certainly be among the cleaner places you've\nrested today . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of the hut appears to be made of planks, sealed here and there\nwith patches of sod.  It's not much, but it would likely keep you dry\nin the rain.\n~\nE\neast north south walls~\nThe walls are bare, but sturdy.\n~\nE\ndoor west~\nThe door separates the closet from the main room of the shack.  When\nclosed, it provides decent privacy.\n~\nS\n#17245\nThe Warrior's Shack.~\nYou have entered a well-kept shack that appears to belong to a warrior\nwho has taken up long-term residence in Shadowvale.  Though plain and\nunfurnished, the stone walls provide protection from the elements and,\nwell, at least the door works.  The trail through town lies to the\nsouth, and a door is set into the eastern wall.\n~\n0 D 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17244\nD2\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17246\nE\nnorth west walls~\nThe stone walls are well-constructed, and on the inside, at least, are\nin good shape.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of this shack actually has shingles, though light shows \nthrough in the corners of the room.  It's better than sleeping in the rain.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in oak planking.  It's worn, but not deteriorating.\nIt's certainly good enough to keep most of the bugs out of your bedroll.\n~\nE\ndoor east~\nThe door to the east isn't as solid as the exterior door, and appears\nto lead to a storage room or closet.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door to the outside is quite sturdy, and will definitely keep out\nwandering fidos and other undesirables.\n~\nS\n#17246\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYou stand at the western-most edge of a small village tucked within\nthe forest.  The town spreads out to the east, hidden beneath the quickly\ndarkening forest.  An air of gloom hangs over the grove, and you see\nlittle movement in the streets.  To your north lies an entrance to\na sturdy stone hut, but a wooden door blocks any view inside.  To your\nsouth is a dilapitated shack--the door is closed, but you can't imagine\nwhy anyone would bother.  The trail leaves town to your west, and leads\ninto the center of town (as well as the deeper forest) to your east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17245\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17248\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17249\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens as it leaves town to the west.  To the east, it becomes\nnarrower as it winds between the scattered buildings and trees.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is open and airy above you, and squirrels frolic among the\nboughs.  You can see that the trees slowly fade to the west, while to the\neast the canopy thickens and eventually fades into darkness.\n~\nE\nsouth shack~\nThe dilapitated shack to the south appears ready to collapse in on\nitself.  The walls are old and rotted, and large chunks of the roof\nare missing.  The well-worn path to the door suggests that someone\nis still using it regularly, despite its condition.\n~\nE\nwooden door~\nIt's a wooden door--your time would be better spent trying to open it.\n~\nE\nnorth stone hut~\nThe sturdy hut is built from cut limestone and looks to be kept up\nregularly.  You judge from the building pattern that it probably also\nextends to the east, but you see no entrance in that direction.  The\nwooden door is closed, but looks like it probably works.\n~\nS\n#17247\nA hut covered in animal hides.~\nHides have been stretched across a frame of bent branches to form a\ndomed hut among the trees.  The floor is clean and dry, and someone\nhas recently been building fires in the center of the room.  A shaft\nof sunlight pierces the hole in the roof which serves as a chimney,\nand casts a dim light about the room.  The doorway to the north leads\nback to the trail.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nstraw pile~\nIt would seem the current occupant is using the pile of straw as a bed.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt has been carefully maintained.  It is smooth\nand, except for a pile of straw in the corner, free of debris.\n~\nE\nhole up~\nYou can just make out the boughs of the trees as the wind blows them\nback and forth above the hut.  The hole is about a dagger's length\nacross--just enough to draw the smoke out, and not enough to let the\nrain in.\n~\nE\nbranches~\nThe branches appear to be taken from willow trees.  About a dozen of\nthem rise around the edge of the cirular shelter, and are tied with\ntwine where they meet at the top.\n~\nE\nhide walls skins~\nThe hides appear to be from a wide variety of animals.  Large skins,\nmost likely from wolves and bears, form the majority of the structure,\nand smaller skins have been used to fill the gaps.  Overall, the work\nis excellent.\n~\nS\n#17248\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17249\nThe trail leading out of Shadowvale.~\nThe trail leads east into a small village hidden within the edge of\nthe forest.  To the west the forest thins and eventually fades altogether.\nSquirrels and other wildlife play in the light cover near the trail, and\nyou can hear the chatter of birds in the surrounding canopy.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail looks well-travelled to the east toward town, but fades here\nand can't be seen to the west.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest thins to the west, but you can't make out the lands beyond.\nThe trail ends here, however, so there can't be too much out there . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the canopy in many places, leaving misty trails\nas it seeks out the ground below.  You notice the eerie contrast with\nthe forest to the east, which quickly becomes dark and menacing.\n~\nE\nnorth south forest~\nThe forest around you consists of random trees scattered among a low\ncovering of bushes and vines.  It has a rather cheerful feel about it,\nand you note a wide range of scents in the air.\n~\nS\n#17250\nA small clearing in the woods.~\nA small clearing has been created just behind the shacks along this\nrow.  Piles of garbage sit rotting along the edge of the forest, which\ncloses quickly in against the southern and western edges of the lot.\nThere are signs of a trail entering the underbrush to the west, but it\nis difficult to make out where it might go.  The back door of a shack\nlies to your east, and the remains of a fallen building lie north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD1\nExit ~\nback door east~\n16387 0 17231\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nE\ndown~\nThe clearing is covered in a soft, green turf.  If it weren't for the\nstink of rotting garbage, it'd be a nice place to rest for awhile.\n~\nE\nup~\nNo trees grow in the lot, and the refreshing glow of sunlight enhances\nthe area.  You can tell from the canopy though that this might be the only\nsunny spot for some distance in any direction.\n~\nE\ntrail west~\nThere appears to be a path leading into the forest at the western edge\nof the clearing, but the undergrowth is so heavy it is hard to be sure.\n~\nE\npile garbage~\nIt looks as if someone has been tossing the remains of meals, and perhaps\nworse, along the edges of this lot.  Even if there was something of value\nburied deep in there, you doubt it's worth enough to dig around and find\nit.\n~\nE\nback door east~\nThe door is simply a variety of random boards and planks tied together\nwith string and vines.  Nice effort, but certainly better at keeping\nout the wind than hearty adventurers like yourself.\n~\nS\n#17251\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail plunges into the forest, and the vegetation immediately\npresses in against you.  It appears that the trail continues south, and\nreturns east to the clearing.\n~\n0 A 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17252\nE\ndown trail~\nThe ground is covered in vegetation, and vines reach out to snag your\nfeet and armor.  The trail is faint, but after a few seconds you can\nsee that it clearly goes south, if anywhere . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest above is so thick that light can hardly penetrate.  The\nlower branches are covered in vines, and you can't see any further into\nthe forest in this direction than in any other.\n~\nE\nwest north forest underbrush~\nThe undergrowth is thick in this part of the forest.  You think the\nbacks of the buildings along the main trail should be to your north, but\nit is impossible to see more than several feet into the vegetation.\nThe trail is the only possible means of passage through this area.\n~\nS\n#17252\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the forest edge.  Vegetation presses in\nfrom the south, east and west preventing further passage.  A strange bush\nprotruding from the forest edge to the west captures your attention.\n~\n0 A 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17253\nE\ndown~\nThick sod, covered in leaves and decaying branches, covers the forest\nfloor.  You feel you should watch carefully where you are walking so\nas not to entangle yourself in the vines.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees grow low over the path, and the vines growing from the\nbranches hang just out of reach.  A wave of claustrophobia overcomes\nyou, and you feel the urge to turn and run.\n~\nE\nsouth east forest underbrush~\nThe underbrush almost reaches out from the forest to draw you in.  You\nhear the cries of a wide variety of wildlife from beyond the edge of the\ntrees, but you can't imagine what would live in such darkness.  You can't,\nthat's for sure . . . you might as well turn around and head back.\n~\nE\nhandle~\nThe handle is too deep in the bush to see.  Perhaps if you opened\nthe bush . . . \n~\nE\nmetal inside~\nThere appears to be a fence inside the bush.  As you investigate further,\nyou notice that the bush gives slightly under your weight.  You feel what\ncould be a handle of some sort . . .\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nAt first glance, the bush appears to be dying.  The leaves have all\ndried out, and the whole thing seems to almost sway and flap in the wind\n . . . almost as if it were hanging.  You see the faint glint of sunlight\nstriking metal deep inside.\n~\nS\n#17253\nThe hidden hut.~\nYou've gained entrance to a hut hidden within the underbrush at the\nedge of the forest.  It is constructed primarily of sod, and has the feel\nof an igloo--but it obviously wasn't built for comfort.  It is clearly\na temporary hideout of some sort, and amenities aren't apparently a\npriority to the owner.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17252\nE\ndown floor~\nSomeone has made an effort to at least pack the dirt on the ground into\nsomething resembling a floor.  Grass still grows in places, but it isn't\ndoing well in the absence of sunlight.\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nFrom the inside, you can see that someone has simply uprooted an\nentire bush and built a wire door frame through the middle.  The bush\nthen hangs from the frame, and from the outside, appears to still be\nhappily anchored in the soil.  You admire the genius that came up with\nthis idea.\n~\nE\n~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\nup branches vines~\nThe branches and vines that form the ceiling provide an interesting\nmaze at which to stare while you lie on your back awaiting sleep.\n~\nE\nwalls west south north sod~\nThe sod was cut from the ground and stacked into piles about 8 feet in\nheight.  A series of branches were added across the top of the room, and\nvines were allowed to grow across them as a \"roof\".  Not exactly the\nbuilding materials you'd choose for a honeymoon suite, but they serve\ntheir current purpose well . . . finding and getting into this hut is\ncertainly a challenge.\n~\nS\n#17254\nA path in the forest.~\nThe forest deepens to the west, and appears nearly impassable.  The trail\ncontinues in that direction though, as well as returning to the east.  The\nvegetation presses in from the north and south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17200\nS\n#17255\nA path through the forest.~\nThe path leads west from here, directly into the heart of the darkest\npart of the forest.  You notice an odd \"stillness\" about the trail in\nthat direction.  The forest pushes in from the south and east, preventing\npassage in those directions altogether.  To the north, the forest thins\nconsiderably.\n~\n0 0 3\nH 200 M 200\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17256\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17254\nE\nsouth east forest vegetation~\nYou note that the trees are becoming larger and older as you move to\nthe west.  Thick underbrush and massive vines block passage to the south\nand east, forcing the trail to turn to the west and north.\n~\nE\nup~\nBeams of sunlight burst through the canopy above, giving the forest about\nyou an eerie glow.  You can see that as you move west, the light disappears\ncompletely, and to the east the forest appears to be thinner.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail turns north and west here, forced to change course by the\nthickening underbrush.\n~\nS\n#17256\nThe path into the forest.~\nThe forest rises in a thick wall to the west.  Large vines and thick\nunderbrush provide an eerie backdrop to the deepeing darkness in that\ndirection.  The trail continues south, plunging into the edge of the\ndeeper woods, and to the east leads to a crossroads.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 3510\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nE\nnorth west vines underbrush forest~\nWhile the forest to the east is relatively clear, the forest to the\nwest is a mass of vegetation.  Thick, dark tree trunks rise far above you\nand squeak with a menacing tone as they sway in wind.  Large vines and\nbrambles grow between them, creating an impenetrable mass.  You can't\nimagine what kind of creatures would make their homes here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest seems to lean over you from the west, almost as it if plans\nto engulf you as a lunchtime snack.  The sun still finds the occasional\nhole to poke through here, but you can see it's having much better luck\nto the east.  Perhaps you would too . . ..\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail thins as it enters the forest to the south, but the hard-\npacked dirt suggests that it does, in fact, get travelled.

It's almost\nas if this were a hidden oasis tucked deep within the forest.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is constructed from old and weather-worn planks, most of which\nwere probably stolen from other structures.  A skimpy door covers the\nentrance.\n~\nE\nlean-to~\nTo the south, a lean-to has been constructed among the trees.  It appears\nto be made of nothing but branches, but it blends into the surrounding\nvegetation so well it is difficult to tell from here.\n~\nS\n#17203\nA lean-to in the woods.~\nThe lean-to has been constructed from bundles of branches lashed to a\ncross-support, which in turn has been secured to two trees.

Not much, but you can tell it's probably effective.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the lean-to is nothing but soft grass.  There is a large\nindentation toward the back--obviously where someone has been sleeping on\na regular basis of late.\n~\nS\n#17204\nA large shack.~\nThe shack is constructed of weathered planks, obviously salvaged from\nother buildings.

A solid wood door sits in the wall\ndirectly to your south, and the hut seems to continue to the west, where\nyou spot a window.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail continues through the trees, which are now thinning enough\nfor you to see that it leads to the west through town, and perhaps even\nwidens a little as it goes.\n~\nE\nshack~\nThe shack is a poor effort at shelter, and seems to consist of nothing\nmore than boards and branches tied to trees.

It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.  You get\nthe distinct feeling that if the neighboring vines should die, the whole\nthing would eventually collapse.\n~\nS\n#17207\nA large stone hut.~\nThe interior of the hut is dark and damp.  The stone walls are bare on the\ninside, and except for several mats on the floor there is nothing in the\nroom.  You hear voices to the west, and can see from the flickering light\naround the edges of the curtain hanging in the doorway that a fire is\nburning there.

This roof surely has no\nproblems with leaks.\n~\nE\nwalls south east stone~\nThe walls are constructed of square limestone blocks, obviously cut\ncarefully to fit.  You're surprised at the effort that went into them,\nand wonder if this building wasn't meant to be something more.\n~\nS\n#17208\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail approaches a small crossroads to the west, and what looks like\nit might be a fountain sits in the midst of the path in that direction.\nTo the east, the trail continues to the forest at the edge of town.  To the\nnorth is a stone building which appears to be a store of some sort, and\nto the south lies a stone hut.  The entrance to the hut is to the east,\nthough the window in front of you seems as if it might allow you to see\ninside.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17210\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17205\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nE\nletter sign~\nThe letters are difficult to make out, but with some effort, you can see\nthat the sign reads:  Blacksmith.\n~\nE\nbuilding store~\nThe building to the north looks to be a storefront, though it is in\ngreat disrepair.  The door covering the entrance is old, but appears as\nif it might still work.  As you get closer, you notice the presence of\nfaint lettering painted above the door.\n~\nE\nsouth hut~\nThe walls of the hut are in good shape, and the thick thatch roof\nsuggests some work has been done to keep this building up.  There is a door\ndown the trail to the east which seems to lead inside, and a window set\ninto the wall in front of you.  You think you see the flicker of flames\nthrough the window, but you can't be sure.\n~\nE\ndoor old~\nThe door is worn and weathered, and the hinges a bit rusty, but it\nseems likely you could still open it.\n~\nE\nup trees~\nThe sun fights its way through the boughs above and, when the branches\nget blown just the right way in the wind, the occasional warm ray of light\nreaches your face.  The canopy shows more signs of life as you move farther\nfrom the dense forests to the east.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here, and straightens out as the trees thin.  \nThe ground is a bit wet, which you attribute to the leaky fountain to the\nwest.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe window is very dirty, but you can make out a dimly-lit room inside\nthe hut.  There seems to be a door on the west side of the room, and\nanother on the east.  The flickering of a small fire draws your attention\nto a small hearth set into the wall.  You aren't sure, but there appears\nto be movement in the shadows.\n~\nS\n#17209\nThe kitchen of a stone hut.~\nThe kitchen of this hut is rather crude, but certainly effective.  A\nsmall hearth is set into the wall, with a variety of racks for hanging\npots and kettles.  A long countertop runs along the opposite wall, with\na series of bins for food storage beneath.  You imagine this building\nmight have once been a small cafe.  A curtain covers the entrance to the\nadjoining room to the east, and another door leads to the west.

They're pitted all\nover, and large chunks are missing in several places.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof of the hut is very sturdy, and probably does a nice job of\nkeeping the place dry.\n~\nE\nwindow north~\nThrough the dirty window you can just make out the trail running east\nand west through town to the north of the hut.  Across the street you\nsee another stone building.\n~\nE\ngroove gouge~\nThe gouges look to have been made from stuff being thrown into, or at,\nthe box on a regular basis.  Maybe the stockboy wasn't too careful.\n~\nE\nbox bin~\nThe wooden box shows signs of wear, and has a number of grooves and\ngouges, both inside and out.  It is currently empty, however.\n~\nE\ncountertop~\nThe countertop is constructed of thick planking laid across a frame\nof sturdy posts.  It runs the full length of the wall, and a box has\nbeen built beneath it to serve as a storage bin.\n~\nE\nfire hearth~\nA small fire is burning in the hearth, started perhaps to prepare this\nevening's dinner.  Unfortunately, you don't see dinner itself anywhere.\n~\nE\ncurtain~\nA curtain sewn from clothing fragments serves as a door to the next room.\n~\nE\nrack pots kettle~\nA crude iron rack hangs above the fire awaiting a pot to hold over the\nfire.  The pots and kettles appear to be clean and usable, but are empty.\nApparently what you smelled from next door was yesterday's leftovers.\n~\nS\n#17210\nBennie's Blacksmith Shop.~\nYou've entered the interior of what was once clearly a blacksmith shop.\nA large hearth sits in the center of the room, providing access from\nall sides.  Rotted shelves line the walls, and a pair of tongs and a\nbillows lie rotting on the countertop.  Though the place might of once\nbeen quite busy, it appears that its better days are long past.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor old~\n16387 0 17208\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17212\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is slowly being overtaken by grass.  You attribute the deep\ndepression near the sliding door to the presence of horses once passing\nin and out for shoeing.  Other than this, the floor is bare--long ago\nvictim to the local scavangers.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nShafts of light pierce the weakened roof in many places, suggesting that\nthis building probably isn't very dry in the rain.  The light casts a dim\naura about the room.\n~\nE\nsliding door~\nThe sliding door to the west provides a wide berth to the street when\nopen.  It would appear that this is where Bennie once brought local\nhorses in and out of the building for shoeing.\n~\nE\neast wall~\nThe remains of a long countertop and storage shelves line the east wall.\n~\nE\nhearth~\nA circular hearth sits in the center of the room, built upon a stone\nfoundation.  The interior shows the scars of many fires, and the large\nchunks of rock missing around the edges suggest that perhaps it has\nbeen hit with a hammer repeatedly in the past.  The remains of several\nsmall fires sit in the bottom of the hearth, but you can tell it has\nbeen some time since it hosted a real blacksmith's furnace.\n~\nE\ncounter countertop~\nAt one time, a long countertop served as a workspace, running the entire\nlength of the east wall.  Like the shelves above it, though, it has been\nstripped of all useful pieces, and consists now of nothing more than a\nrotting frame.\n~\nE\nshelf shelves~\nLong, sturdy shelves at one time covered most of the interior walls in this\nbuilding, providing a massive amount of storage space.  Most of the wood\nhas long ago rotted or been removed for use elsewhere in town, though, and\nnot much remains but the frames.\n~\nE\nbillows~\nThere's not much left of the billows but the wooden frame.  It looks\nas though a leather \"bag\" for holding air might once have been attached,\nbut it has long ago rotted.  The only thing these would be useful for\nnow would be the wood scraps.\n~\nE\ntongs~\nThe tongs are old and rusted, and show the wear and tear of being thrusted\ninto the scorching flames time and time again.  Unfortunately, they aren't\nin any condition to salvage.\n~\nS\n#17211\nCrossroads at the center of town.~\nYou stand at the center of town, where the trail forms a sort of a\ncrossroad.  To the north you see a \"street\" that ends in a dead end.  The\nbuildings along each side appear to be nicer than those in the rest of\ntown.  The trail continues east and west through town, and another\nleads south, running between more buildings before it eventually leaves\ntown.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17208\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17214\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17213\nE\ntrail~\nThe trail continues east and west to the edges of town at least.  To the\nsouth it widens a bit and appears to eventually become a road.\n~\nE\nstreet~\nThe street runs north and comes to an end at a building.  Other\nbuildings line the east and west sides.  It looks a little more promising\nthan the rest of town, and perhaps like it might have been the first\npart of town constructed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy has thinned considerably, and you can see now that the forest\nthins overhead to the west and the south.  Sunlight sneaks through in\nplaces, casting an eerie light over this part of Shadowvale.\n~\nE\ndown mud~\nYuck.  The mud has covered your boots, and you can feel the water seeping\ninto your socks . . ..\n~\nS\n#17212\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to a dead end at the wall of a stone\nbuilding several doors down.  This section of town looks somewhat more\npermanent than the rest, and the buildings are all of stone.  A wooden\ndoor leads to the building to the west, and a large sliding door provides\naccess to the stone building to the east.  To the south lies the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor sliding~\n16387 0 17210\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17217\nE\nslinding door~\nThe large wooden door hangs from a metal rail, and slides to one side\nto provide access to the building.  It would appear to be some sort\nof loading dock, or perhaps a stable door.\n~\nE\nwest structure~\nFour sturdy stone walls uphold the frame of a very old building, yet\nyou can see that the roof is in serious disrepair.  Planks have been\nstripped from the windows and awnings, most likely for use elsewhere in\ntown.  The door is battered, but is closed and probably rusted shut.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy above is much lighter, and you see small patches of sky\nbetween the boughs.  The forest thickens to the east and north, hanging\ndrearily over the edges of the village.  To the south and east it thins,\nand it looks as though the sun may actually be shining through.\n~\nE\ndown trail ground~\nThe trail here is heavily travelled.  It looks like most of the traffic\nleads to the huts at the end, as weeds grow freely along the rest of the\nbuildings.\n~\nE\neast building~\nThe building to the east looks to have once been a store of some sort.\nThe door on this side of the building is large, and slides to one side.\nIt looks like it might have been a loading dock, or maybe even a small\nstable.  A hitching post runs along the side of the building.\n~\nE\npost hitching~\nA worn branch has been mounted across two posts alongside the building.\nAt one time, judging from the considerable wear, many horses were tied\nhere on a regular basis.\n~\nS\n#17213\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nThe trail wanders west from the crossroads through another section of\ntown.  The walls of the buildings to the north and south of the crossroads\nlie to each side.  Several other buildings line the trail before it\neventually leads to the edge of town.  To the east lie the crossroads\nin the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy thins the further west you go, until it eventually\ndisappears somewhere beyond the edge of town.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is still narrow and winding along this stretch of town, but\nit would appear that it widens a bit to the west.\n~\nE\nnorth south walls~\nThe buildings to each side of the trail are made of stone and allow\nno access from this side.  You note that it looks like the roof is\ncollapsing a little on the building to the north.\n~\nS\n#17214\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail passes between two stone structures as it continues north\nand south through town.  To your north lies a small crossroads, and to\nthe south the trail leads to the edge of town.  The hut to the east is\nin good shape, but a door prevents you from seeing inside.  To the west\nlies a stone shanty.  A curtain made of a thick hide is pulled tightly\nacross the doorway, and strange markings are scrawled in red along each\nside of the entrance.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17211\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17209\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17229\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor curtain hide~\n16387 0 17228\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens a bit here and takes on the appearance of an actual\nroad.  It looks as though this southern route gets used often--the dirt\nis well-packed and the path free from grass.\n~\nE\nmarkings red sign~\nThe markings are in a script you don't recognize, but they have a\ndecidely evil feeling about them.  You get the impression the paint used\nto make them was probably blood . . ..\n~\nE\ncurtain hide~\nThe curtain is simply the hide of a large animal, perhaps an oxen or\nwater buffalo.  It's secured from the top, and seems to be tied loosely\nat the bottom as well.  You should be able to open it, though.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest canopy continues to thin to the south, and the forest retreats\nsomewhat behind the buildings.  It feels a lot less enclosed here.  The\nsun breaks through the trees to warm your face, and a gentle breeze blows\nfrom the south.\n~\nE\nhut~\nThe hut is a fine, stone building.  The exterior masonry is of high \nquality, and the roof is in good shape.  You note a small quantity of smoke\nwafting from the top of the chimney.\n~\nE\nshanty~\nThe shanty is built of loosely-fitted stone which appears to be more\n\"piled\" than \"fitted\".  You can see that the roof is old, but see no\nmajor holes.  It might be a good place to rest . . . if it isn't inhabited.\n~\nS\n#17215\nThe remains of a shack.~\nYou stand in the midst of a deteriorating shack.  It appears as if it was\nonce attached to the store to the south, perhaps as workspace.  Shelves\nline the stone walls, and an old anvil stands in the corner.  The wall to\nthe west is almost entirely collapsed, providing access to the trail\noutside.  To the south a door connects to the storefront.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17210\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nLittle remains of the roof but the rafters, which are now largely\nover-grown with vines.  With a little work, you could find a sheltered\ncorner to rest in.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nGrass has started to re-take the ground inside the hut.  There is still\na lot of bare ground, and it appears as though someone has been sleeping\nhere regularly.\n~\nE\nnorth east wall shelves shelf~\nSturdy shelves have been built directly into the stone walls, providing\na significant amount of storage space.  They have long been stripped of\nanything of value they might once have held, and are home to only dust\nnow.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door isn't too sturdy, and was clearly designed to be an interior\nfixture.  It appears to be in good working condition.\n~\nS\n#17216\nAlong the dead-end street.~\nThe trail to the north comes to an end soon at the wall of a stone hut.\nTo the south, it leads back to the center of town.  An empty doorway leads\nto the building to the west, and the wall of the building to the east has\ncollapsed, allowing you access.  The prospects look best to the north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17219\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17215\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17212\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17218\nE\ndown trail~\nIt doesn't look much like anyone ever stops here.  The trail is well\nworn running north and south, but weeds cover the ground to the east and\nwest.  You note a slight rise as the trail runs north.\n~\nE\nup~\nIt's amazing how fast the canopy thickens, and a dull grey has set in\nabout you.  You can see that the edge of the forst lies just beyond the\nbuildings in all directions, and you're surprised that is hasn't yet\nengulfed the whole town.\n~\nE\ncollapsed wall rubble~\nThe remains of the wall consist of large stones and mortar.  It won't\ntake much effort to climb over it.\n~\nS\n#17217\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17218\nA sturdy lean-to.~\nAll that remains of the once proud stone building that stood here is the\nfront wall.  The back wall is partially collapsed, and is now a waist-high\npile of rubble.  Some enterprising resident has constructed a roof between\nthe two walls by laying branches and reeds across a series of slim poles.\nIt's not pretty, but it's clean and looks rather comfortable.  The trail\nlies to the east.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nE\nnorth south~\nThe walls of the neighboring building are covered with scattered vines\nand large patches of mold.  Not very attractive, but interesting . . ..\n~\nE\nbranches reed roof ceiling~\nMost of the original branches used to create the ceiling are long-dead\nand starting to rot.  The mass of vegetation from the forest beyond has\ngrown over much of it, though, and has nicely filled gaps as they formed.\n~\nE\nrubble back~\nThe pile of rubble, which consists of mostly large blocks of stone,\nstands about chest-high to a dwarf.  You'd probably have to crawl to\nactually get back to it . . . and it certainly doesn't look like it's\nworth the effort.\n~\nS\n#17219\nThe end of the dead-end street.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the wall of a large stone structure.  It's\nhard to tell for sure, but you'd guess that the building to the north is\npart of either the building to the east or west, or maybe both.  A sturdy\noak door covers the entrance of the shack to the east, and a strong, solid\niron door blocks the entrance to the hut to your west.  You can try your\nluck with either of those, or take the trail back to the south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17220\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17216\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17223\nE\nup~\nYou feel claustrophobic beneath the shadow of the overhanging trees\nalong this end of the street.  The owners of these homes obviously didn't\nchoose the location for the wealth of sunlight it offers.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail branches neatly to the left and right to the entrances of the\ntwo buildings.  It would seem that the residents use it a lot.\n~\nE\nnorth wall~\nIt's as good a wall as you've ever seen, but that's about it.  It looks\nlike someone might even be clearing the vines off of it on occasion.\n~\nE\nsturdy oak~\nThe door is made of heavy oak planks that bear the scars of many seasons.\nIt looks like it might bear the scars of a few swordfights as well.  It's\nno worse for the wear, though, and if it's locked you won't likely be\ngetting in without a key.\n~\nE\niron~\nThis huge door is constructed of solid iron, decorated with the occasional\nrivet to hold the hinges and latch.  Considering that it's attached to a\nwindowless stone building, you imagine it might once have been a bank or\nsome other important structure.\n~\nS\n#17220\nLiving room of a small house.~\nYou can see, now that you are inside, that this shack is actually more\nof a home.  Sparse furnishings litter the room, and a picture hangs on the\nwall above a small fireplace.  It's actually rather cozy.  The front\ndoor leads back to the trail, and another door leads north to an adjoining\nroom.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17221\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak~\n16387 0 17219\nE\nup roof ceiling~\nThis house has a proper roof, with relatively new planking serving to\nkeep the elements at bay.  You venture a guess that someone probably\nlives here regularly.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is nothing but packed and swept dirt, but it has aged well\nand is very clean.  You're surprised, in fact, at how clean this whole\nplace is.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls of cut stone are clean and free of the mold you see growing\non other buildings in Shadowvale.  The more you look it over, the more\nyou like this place.\n~\nE\npicture~\nA drawing of an ugly giant in a crude wood frame hangs slightly askew\non the wall.  The inscription below reads \"Brutus\".  You wonder if it's\ntrue that a mother always thinks her child is cute . . . and, if so, just\nwhat Brutus' mother might look like . . ..\n~\nE\nfireplace~\nA small stone hearth set into the stone wall flickers brightly from the\nsmall fire within.  The rack inside suggests it might also be used for\ncooking as well.\n~\nS\n#17221\nBrutus' Guest Room.~\nThis room is nicely furnished with a bed, a small nightstand and a desk.\nAgain, it is spotless.  You realize now that this is probably the guest\nquarters for the larger house across the street to the west.  This looks\nlike it would be a nice place to rest, or the door to the south will\ntake you back to the living room.\n~\n0 D 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17220\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof in this room is the same as that in the adjoining room, and it\nseems to be connected to the building next door.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor here is well-kept as well.  A nice rug made from the skin of\nsome unknown animal lies alongside the bed, and there's not a dust ball\nto be found.\n~\nE\nbed~\nThe bed is nothing but a simple cot, but it looks plenty comfortable.\n~\nE\nrug skin~\nThe hide is a dark black in color, with thick, coarse hair.  If pressed\nfor an answer, you'd guess it was from a large bear.\n~\nE\nnight stand table~\nA small wooden table serves as a nightstand next to the bed.  An oil\nlamp, built into the center of the table, provides light for the room.\n~\nE\noil lamp~\nIt's a very simple lamp, but it's unique in that it's somehow fixed\nto the table.  It's much to awkward to be of use anywhere else, and\nserves its purpose here very well.\n~\nE\nwalls north west east~\nThe stone walls are almost polished from constant brushing and cleaning.\nYou're impressed at the effort put into the upkeep of this place,\nespecially when you consider the neighborhood.\n~\nS\n#17222\nInside Windrunner's Crystal Ball~\nYou find yourself suspended in the air amidst a kaleidoscope of swirling\nmist.  After a moment, you realize you have been transferred to the inside\nof Windrunner's Crystal Ball--where he puts imputent mortals he needs to\nattend to . . ..  You feel it would be best to wait and see what he wants.\n~\n0 CDKNT 9\nO windrunner~\nE\nmist swirling~\nThe mist swirls about you in a fantastic variety of colors.  You find the\neffect almost mesmerizing.\n~\nS\n#17223\nThe entrance to Brutus' house.~\nYou've entered a small room that serves as the foyer for a rather\nlarge hut.  Actually, it's almost a house.  Several pairs of boots\nare lined neatly along the wall, and above them a series of hooks\nwait patiently for someone to hang a coat on them.  Other than this, the\nroom is bare.  You hear voices coming from the adjoining room to the\nnorth, and an iron door leads east.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17224\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor iron~\n16391 17211 17219\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe sturdy roof is constructed of heavy planking across a timber frame.\nFrom the looks of it, this house was built to endure.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor, though generally free of debris, is a bit muddy.  You hope it\ndoesn't mess up your nice boots.\n~\nE\nwest south wall~\nThe walls are made of large stone blocks, cut to fit tightly.  They are\nworn smooth with age, but remain sturdy.  Spikes have been driven into\nthem in various places to serve as hangers.\n~\nE\nspike hanger~\nIt's your basic metal spike . . . and it's driven securely into the wall.\n~\nE\niron door~\nThe heavy iron door looks a lot less imposing from the inside than it\ndid from the trail.  In fact, you're guessing it isn't solid at all, and\nis probably just a facade to fool the local \"wildlife\".\n~\nE\nboots~\nThe boots are smelly and worn, and you decide quickly you don't really\nwant to examine them further . . . ..\n~\nS\n#17224\nBrutus' Waiting Room.~\nYou are in what appears to be a waiting room, or perhaps a common room,\nfor the larger house about you.  The room is bare except for three logs\nthat serve as chairs and a picture on the wall.  A torch affixed to the\nwall provides enough light for you to see back into the entryway to the\nsouth, but, strangely, you see no other doors.  You could have sworn that\nfrom the outside this place looked a lot bigger . . ..\n  Maybe you were wrong.\n~\n0 D 3\nD1\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17225\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17223\nE\ntorch~\nIt's a simple torch, and it's secured to the wall . . . .\n~\nE\npicture~\nA charcoal sketch of a giant, who appears to be a thief, adorns the\neast wall.  It's not life-size, but it's at least four feet in height.\nThe word \"Brutus\" is written along the bottom of the sketch.  You're\ncertain that Brutus isn't the type of guy you'd want to invite to your\nMom's house for dinner . . ..\n~\nE\nwest north wall~\nThe walls, though clean, are unadorned.  Someone must have figured they\nwere working hard enough just holding up the ceiling.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling in this room takes on a slight A-Frame appearance.  You\njudge from its construction that this room was built sometime before,\nand in a much better fashion, than the entryway to the south.\n~\nS\n#17225\nBrutus' bedroom.~\nYou've entered Brutus' private sanctuary.  A small desk sits in the corner,\nand is covered in slips of paper and ledgers.  Apparently Brutus is the\nhead honcho in these parts.  A bedroll is unrolled in front of the hearth,\nwhere a small fire warms the room.  You can exit to the west through the\nsecret door, or another door will take you north.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17226\nD3\nExit ~\npicture secret~\n16487 17227 17224\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16451 0 11185\nE\nsecret picture~\nTo the west a hole has been roughly hewn into the wall, and you can see\nthat it's been covered with a crudely fashion door to which the picture\nwas then mounted.  Very ingenious.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt is clean, except for small piles of wood\nscraps around the hearth.  The bedroll occupies a corner of the room.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is constructed of spaced planks with wood shingles laid over\nthem.  It would seem that this isn't the orginal roof, and that perhaps\nBrutus had some work done recently.\n~\nE\neast south walls~\nThe walls are made of stone and mortar.  They're discolored with age,\nbut basically in good shape.\n~\nE\nbedroll~\nThe bedroll is nothing but an old, ratty blanket, and you imagine it's\nprobably the source fo the horrible smell in the room.\n~\nE\nhearth fire~\nA small hearth is set into the wall, and a fire has recently been started.\nIt looks like Brutus was settling in for the evening.\n~\nE\nslips paper ledger~\nSeveral slips marked \"I.O.U.\" lay scattered about a large ledger.  In it\nBrutus seems to be tracking his income.  It looks like he's not only\ntrafficking in stolen merchandise, but collecting \"taxes\" from the local\nresidents as well.  From what you know about numbers, Brutus appears to\nbe doing very nicely for himself.\n~\nE\ndesk~\nIt's a small, simple desk.  It's made of wood, with a stone top.  There\nare holes in the front where drawers used to be, but Brutus seems to have\nfound little use for them.\n~\nS\n#17226\nBrutus' closet.~\nThis small closet is where Brutus probably keeps his inventory.  Too bad\nfor you his stock seems to be depleted.  The door to the south takes you\nback to the main bedroom.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17225\nD5\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17227\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe ceiling of the closet slopes steeply as it's near the edge of the\nhut.  Other than a few rope marks where someone seems to have hung something\nheavy, there's little of interest up there.\n~\nE\nnorth west east walls~\nThe closet has the same stone walls as the rest of the hut . . . what\ndid you expect?\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of the closet isn't as clean as the floor of the room outside.\nIn fact, it looks a bit like the dirt has been recently disturbed . . ..\n~\nS\n#17227\nBrutus' secret storage room.~\nThat Brutus, he's a pretty smart guy.  The room has been dug beneath\nthe closet, and is rather crude.  It's big enough to store quite a bit\nof illegal merchandise in, though--even if it doesn't stay very clean.\n~\n0 AD 3\nD4\nExit ~\nsecret dirt~\n16487 17220 17226\nE\nnorth south east west down walls dirt~\nThe walls are dirt, and they aren't very well-supported.  Little bits\nhave caved in here and there, and in several spots it looks like sharp\nweapons, maybe spears, were stuck into the walls for storage.  You wonder\nhow many good rains it will take until this whole end of the house sinks\ninto the ground.\n~\nE\nup secret~\nYou can see from below that the secret door is made from thick planks,\nand is laid across the top of the hole.

It would also seem\nthat they have tracked all sorts of dirt and other gross things in with\nthem.  You can see why the priest made the cot.\n~\nE\ncot bed~\nA simple cot, consisting of a board laid across to pieces of firewood,\nsits in the corner of the shack.  It looks really uncomfortable, but\nyou could see the advantages of it over, say, sleeping on the floor.\n~\nE\ndoor curtain hide~\nThe door to the shack consists of a simple hide nail to the upper\ncorners.  Apparently the priest trusts his clientele a little more\nthat you would.\n~\nE\nup ceiling~\nThe ceiling of the shack is made of randomly over-laid planks.  The gaps\nare plugged with rags and other assorted materials, and the effort looks\nto be mildly successful.\n~\nE\nnorth west south walls~\nThe walls of the shack are simply planks, coated with a thin film of\nwhat looks like mud.

They do serve to keep the elements at bay, however . . ..\n~\nS\n#17229\nA trail leading south through town.~\nThe trail continues north and south through Shadowvale.  To the north\nyou see a crossroads and what appears to be a fountain.  To the south,\nthe trail becomes a road out of town.

A flimsy door has\nbeen set into the entrance, and a small window sits off to one side of\nthe door.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the trees above in various places, dispelling\nsome of the eerie shadows from the trees above.

As you wipe a spot clean, you note that\nthe curtains are drawn and you can't see in anyway.\n~\nE\ndoor flimsy~\nThe door most likely keeps out nothing but the rain.  Still, it'd be\neasier to open it than to kick it in . . ..\n~\nS\n#17230\nA poorly-built shack.~\nThis small shack is nothing more than planks and branches tied together\nin completely random patterns.  It appears to be a continuing process, and\nwhen a new hole appears another scrap is used to cover it.  You get\nthe feeling it's eventually going to get so heavy it will collapse in on\nitself.

It looks comfortable enough to sleep on, but the apparent volume\nof traffic makes you wonder if that's a good idea.\n~\nE\nup ceiling roof~\nThe roof is a victim of the same planning process as the walls.

As it leaves town, the trail leads slowly down into a wide valley.\nThe trees continue to thin in that direction, and you can't be sure, but\nyou think you see the glint of sunlight reflecting off water far down in\nthe valley.

The repairs look almost as sturdy as the\nremaining foundation, if not moreso.  It's clearly an old building, but\nsomeone is making an effort to keep it well-maintained.\n  A solid oak door is set into the doorway, blocking your view inside.\n~\nE\nvine patch mortar branch~\nSomeone seems to have patched holes in the foundation of the hut with\na mixture of muddy mortar and branches.  Vines have taken root, providing\nan overlying web of flora.  The patches give the hut a very \"earthy\"\nappearance, almost like a large, moss-covered rock with a nice patch\nof sod growing on top.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail is well-trodden here, and it appears many pairs of boots have\nmade the journey south.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun struggles to break through the canopy here, and it appears to\nbe having much more success to the south.  You see birds among the boughs\nof the oaks again, and the chatter of squirrels filters down from far\nabove.\n~\nE\ndoor oak plank~\nThe door to this hut has been cut from a single width of hard oak\nplanking.  It looks very secure, which is good, but rare, in this\nneighborhood.  If it's locked, it would probably be easier to cut a\nhole in the wall than to break it down.\n~\nS\n#17233\nA well-built hut.~\nYou have entered a very comfortable shack.  Though the only furniture\nis a bed in one corner, the shack appears to have been recently cleaned.\nThe walls are solid, and the roof is strong enough to keep out the rain.\nWhat a wonderful place to hide away and rest.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor oak plank~\n16387 0 17232\nE\noak plank~\nThe door looks as solid from the inside as it did from outside.

Someone did a very nice job of building it.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor of the hut is basically hard-packed dirt.  However, it's\npacked very well, and is almost as solid as stone.\n~\nE\nwalls east north south~\nThe walls of the hut consist of a waist-high stone foundation and smooth\nplanks above that.  They are entirely bare, and could use some decoration.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nThe door looks just as good inside, and is in very good shape.  If you\nwere to close it, it would probably keep unwanted characters out.\n~\nS\n#17234\nThe remains of a burned building.~\nYou stand amidst the charred ruins of what once might have been a very\nnice shack.  There certainly was a lot of wood in it, as the ashes are\nknee deep and charcoal beams still attempt to hold a roof that no longer\nexists.

You\nare amazed at the resilience of the forest behind the building, and can't\neven imagine how horrible it would be to get stuck in it.\n~\nE\nashes ruins~\nDeep piles of gray ashes, matted into flat mounds by wind and rain,\nprovide an eerie backdrop for the grim black beams which rise like the\ntrees on some lost desert plain.  This place is creepy, even by local\nstandards.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest has already begun to reclaim the back wall of the house.  The\nvines have made themselves at home on the remaining wall supports, and\nhave created an impassable wall of vegetation.\n~\nE\nsouth~\nA short stone foundation survived on the southern side of the lot, \ndefiantly supporting the last remains of the only thing that can be clearly\nidentified as a wall.  Through the remains you can see that the forest\nappears to thin to the south, and you see the trail leading south into\nthe woods just in front of the building.\n~\nE\nnorth~\nThe owners of the building to the north seem to have salvaged a lot of\nthe useful materials from this site, and used them to re-build their\nsouthern wall.  They didn't do a very good job, though, and none of the\npieces fit together.  Cracks and holes appear all over.\n~\nE\nhole crack~\nYou can make out faint shapes inside the shack.  It's too dark to be\nsure, but judging from the whispering and sounds of shuffling, it sounds\nlike the residents might be home . . . and there's more than one person\nat home.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe gray ashes are a little damp, and are making a mess of your boots.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is much thinner here than at the northern edges of town, and\nthe occasional ray of sun sneaks through.  It appears that the trees\ncontinue to thin to the south.\n~\nS\n#17235\nA trail leading south out of town.~\nYou stand on the southern edge of the small village of Shadowvale.  The\ntown, which spreads out to your north, has a dark and menacing feel about\nit--even here you feel many eyes watching you.

The forest is just thin enough that\nyou could leave the trail without getting too horribly lost, but you see\nnothing of interest that would justify the effort.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun beams down upon you brightly as you look up to see squirrels\nplaying among the trees.

It might still\nprovide shelter . . . if you can wedge yourself into a dry corner.  The\ndoorway is empty, the door long-ago stolen for some other housing project.\n~\nS\n#17237\nA campsite in an empty lot.~\nThis vacant lot has been used as a campsite so many times that it has\ntaken on a permanent appearance.  The remains of several fires are\nscattered about the site, and a pine grove that begins on the north\nend of the lot provides nice cover for sleeping.

Shade can be gained under the pines to the north, and you\ncan see the forest rising above the far side of the grove.\n~\nE\neast west wall~\nA barrier of weeds and shrubs rings the lot along the edges of the\nneighboring buildings.  The walls appear to be solid and offer no access\nto the inside of either structure.\n~\nE\ncampfire fire~\nSeveral blackened circles surrounded with stones are scattered about\nthe lot.  Half-burned logs, apparently from the pine forest, lie rotting\naround the edges of each site.\n~\nS\n#17238\nA small pine grove.~\nYou have wandered into a small pine grove tucked away behind the homes\nin this area.  The underbrush has been tamed in this clearing, and the\nfresh scent of the small pines is quite refreshing.  The grove continues\nto your north and west.  To your east lies the back wall of a shack, and\nto the south a campsite.

There do not\nappear to be any windows or other distinguishing features.\n~\nE\nflowery vines~\nThe vines appear to be from the morning glory family.  They cover the\nwall in thick patterns, sprouting patches of beautiful purple teacup\nshaped flowers here and there.  Insects and small birds play contentedly\nin the cover they provide.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe bed of pine needles which covers the ground is quite thick.  There\nare patches here and there where piles of needles have been gathered, most\nlikely for use in building fire.  The softness of the ground is a welcome\ntreat for your aching feet.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe boughs of the pines dance lightly in the wind overhead.  Birds and\nsquirrels ramble aimlessly among the branches searching for food.\n~\nS\n#17239\nA small pine grove.~\nThe serenity of the pine grove calms your anxieties as you venture\ndeeper within.  The heavy undergrowth of the forest once again rises to\nchoke out the pines and block passage to the north, and the back of\na house lies to your east.  The grove continues west and south . . . \nsuddenly, a loud cry captures your attention, and it appears to be coming\nfrom the west.\n~\n0 0 3\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17238\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17240\nE\npine tree~\nYou're amazed that these little trees do so well in the midst of the\ndark forest.  They can't be over 20 feet tall, and it's almost as if\nmagic protects them from the darkness around them.\n~\nE\nforest vines undergrowth~\nThe forest rises quickly above the grove, the undergrowth rising at its\nfeet to form a wall of vegetation that is clearly impassable.\n~\nE\nwindow~\nThe inside of the house is dimly lit, but you can clearly make out the\nshapes of two large \"men\" sitting around a table.  You make a mental note\nof the house's location so as not to accidentally wander in on them.\n~\nE\neast house shack~\nThe house to the east appears to be constructed of stone, and is in\nvery good shape.  Vines cover the back wall, but you can make out a window\nhidden behind a patch of flowers.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe soft needles here are not as nice as the ones at the entrance to\nthe grove . . . mushrooms, vines and other offshoots frmo the forest\nfight for a foothold.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy of the neighboring forest towers above the edge of the grove,\nreminding you again of the ominous nature of the entire village.  Once\nagain, life appears almost non-existent overhead . . . though you do feel\nthe odd sensation of being watched . . ..\n~\nS\n#17240\nA small pine grove.~\nThere is a small clearing in the pine forest, and a lone pine tree \nstands in the northwest corner of the grove.  As you peer intently\nup into the branches, you see a large owl's nest perched just out of\nreach.

It looks pretty spooky anyway . . ..\n~\nE\ntree pine~\nThe pine tree stands alone in the corner of the clearing, as if holding\noff the forest by itself.  It provides a perfect perch for the owl to\nsurvey the grove, and plenty of room to swoop quickly down upon its\nunsuspecting dinner guests.\n~\nE\nnest~\nThe owl's nest looks to be about a yard in width, and is constructed\nof twigs and leaves wedged into a deep hole in the tree.  It sits just\nout of your reach . . . and the tree offers no branches for you to climb.\n~\nE\nskeleton~\nThe skeleton appears to be that of a rat, or perhaps a small cat.  It\nis about the right size for an owl's dinner.  It's best left alone.\n~\nE\ndown needles~\nThe ground is relatively clear here--a perfect area for an owl's\nhunting grounds.  A small skeleton lies half-covered in pine needles,\nbut you see no other signs that anyone has been here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest hangs precariously above the pine grove, drowning out most\nof the light.  Besides the owl's nest, there are few signs of life here.\n~\nS\n#17241\nA small pine grove.~\nThis corner of the pine grove is very pleasant, and is by far the\nbrightest.  The forest closes in to block passage to the west, and adds\nan ominous gloom to an otherwise nice place.  The wall of a stone building\nlies to your south, and the pine grove runs to the east and north.

The needles\nshow places where several others have rested, at least one of whom was\nbleeding . . . the trail of blood leads off to the north.\n~\nE\nstone wall house building~\nThe back of the house is simply a rock wall, offering no windows or\ndoors for passage.\n~\nE\nwest forest undergrowth~\nThough it appears that the forest thins a bit to the west, there's no\nway you're going to get there from here to find out.  It's almost as if\nsomeone has been encouraging the forest to form a wall . . . it's hard\nto believe it could be so consistently unpassable on it's own.\n~\nE\nbirds~\nThe birds appear to be only sparrows, and they're far out of your\nreach.  There's probably a better meal to be had somewhere else.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou spot several birds fluttering around amongst the pines, and hear\nthe distinct sounds of squirrels playing out of sight.\n~\nE\npine tree~\nThe trees provide a nice amount of cover here, and it would be a\nwonderful place to kick back and ponder the mysteries of life . . ..\n~\nS\n#17242\nThe remains of a shack.~\nThis shack has pretty much reached the end of its useful life.  The\nroof has collapsed in upon the interior, and most anything of use was\nlong ago stripped and salvaged.  You can climb across the rubble, where\na small clearing seems to sit in back of the building to the south, or\nexit to the path through town to the north.  To the east lies the exterior\nwall of a sturdy building, and to the west you see a hide-covered hut,\nbut no way to enter it.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nE\neast building wall~\nThe bare face of a stone wall forms the back of the building to the east.\nThere would appear to be no access from this side.\n~\nE\nwest hide hut~\nTo the west you can just make out what looks like an igloo made of\nanimal skins tucked within the trees.  However, you can't tell much more\nthan that from this vantage point.\n~\nE\nrubble~\nThe rubble would appear to be the remains of a rock wall which fell\nvictim to the elements some time ago.  It is now only a waist-high pile\nof rocks and boards.  You should be able to climb over it easily to get\nto the clearing beyond.\n~\nE\ndown~\nGrass and a variety of weeds have started to re-establish themselves now\nthat the shack has collapsed.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees have thinned overhead, but the sun isn't at the proper angle\nto reach this particular lot.  Too bad, the grass could use some help.\n~\nS\n#17243\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYour attention is immediately drawn to the hut to the south, which appears\nto be constructed of animal hides and stands out awkwardly from the forest.\nTo your north is the stone wall of an old hut, the entrance of which lies\nfurther to the west.  The edge of town lies to your west, and the trail\neast will take you into the center of town.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17236\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17247\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\nhut hide~\nFrom the trail, it looks as though the hut is made of a large segment\nof leather pulled taught over some sort of from.  Further inspection\nmight provide more insights.\n~\nE\nup~\nYou are clearly near the western edge of the forest, as the trees become\nmuch thicker, and ominously darker, the further east you look.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail here is well-packed and dry.  It looks like many pairs of\nfeet, and in some cases multiple pairs, have used the trail recently.\n~\nE\nwall stone~\nExcept for a few small vines and some patches of fungus, the stone wall\nis bare.  You can tell from the outside that the door to this building is\nthe one just west of here.\n~\nE\ndoor~\nYou'll have to go a little farther west down the trail to see the door\nproperly.\n~\nS\n#17244\nA storage closet.~\nThe closet is very plain.  Several nails have been pounded into the\nwalls to serve as hooks, and the floor is scratched from the occasional\ntrunk that has been dragged in and out.  It is otherwise very clean\nand somewhat secure.  It's value as a hideout might outweigh its\noriginal purpose.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17245\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor is simply a series of planks embedded in the ground, but it's\nlevel and dry.  It would certainly be among the cleaner places you've\nrested today . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of the hut appears to be made of planks, sealed here and there\nwith patches of sod.  It's not much, but it would likely keep you dry\nin the rain.\n~\nE\neast north south walls~\nThe walls are bare, but sturdy.\n~\nE\ndoor west~\nThe door separates the closet from the main room of the shack.  When\nclosed, it provides decent privacy.\n~\nS\n#17245\nThe Warrior's Shack.~\nYou have entered a well-kept shack that appears to belong to a warrior\nwho has taken up long-term residence in Shadowvale.  Though plain and\nunfurnished, the stone walls provide protection from the elements and,\nwell, at least the door works.  The trail through town lies to the\nsouth, and a door is set into the eastern wall.\n~\n0 D 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor east~\n16487 17216 17244\nD2\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17246\nE\nnorth west walls~\nThe stone walls are well-constructed, and on the inside, at least, are\nin good shape.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe roof of this shack actually has shingles, though light shows \nthrough in the corners of the room.  It's better than sleeping in the rain.\n~\nE\ndown~\nThe floor is covered in oak planking.  It's worn, but not deteriorating.\nIt's certainly good enough to keep most of the bugs out of your bedroll.\n~\nE\ndoor east~\nThe door to the east isn't as solid as the exterior door, and appears\nto lead to a storage room or closet.\n~\nE\ndoor south~\nThe door to the outside is quite sturdy, and will definitely keep out\nwandering fidos and other undesirables.\n~\nS\n#17246\nThe trail through Shadowvale.~\nYou stand at the western-most edge of a small village tucked within\nthe forest.  The town spreads out to the east, hidden beneath the quickly\ndarkening forest.  An air of gloom hangs over the grove, and you see\nlittle movement in the streets.  To your north lies an entrance to\na sturdy stone hut, but a wooden door blocks any view inside.  To your\nsouth is a dilapitated shack--the door is closed, but you can't imagine\nwhy anyone would bother.  The trail leaves town to your west, and leads\ninto the center of town (as well as the deeper forest) to your east.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\nwooden door~\n16387 0 17245\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 17248\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17249\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail widens as it leaves town to the west.  To the east, it becomes\nnarrower as it winds between the scattered buildings and trees.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe canopy is open and airy above you, and squirrels frolic among the\nboughs.  You can see that the trees slowly fade to the west, while to the\neast the canopy thickens and eventually fades into darkness.\n~\nE\nsouth shack~\nThe dilapitated shack to the south appears ready to collapse in on\nitself.  The walls are old and rotted, and large chunks of the roof\nare missing.  The well-worn path to the door suggests that someone\nis still using it regularly, despite its condition.\n~\nE\nwooden door~\nIt's a wooden door--your time would be better spent trying to open it.\n~\nE\nnorth stone hut~\nThe sturdy hut is built from cut limestone and looks to be kept up\nregularly.  You judge from the building pattern that it probably also\nextends to the east, but you see no entrance in that direction.  The\nwooden door is closed, but looks like it probably works.\n~\nS\n#17247\nA hut covered in animal hides.~\nHides have been stretched across a frame of bent branches to form a\ndomed hut among the trees.  The floor is clean and dry, and someone\nhas recently been building fires in the center of the room.  A shaft\nof sunlight pierces the hole in the roof which serves as a chimney,\nand casts a dim light about the room.  The doorway to the north leads\nback to the trail.\n~\n0 D 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17243\nE\nstraw pile~\nIt would seem the current occupant is using the pile of straw as a bed.\n~\nE\ndown floor~\nThe floor of packed dirt has been carefully maintained.  It is smooth\nand, except for a pile of straw in the corner, free of debris.\n~\nE\nhole up~\nYou can just make out the boughs of the trees as the wind blows them\nback and forth above the hut.  The hole is about a dagger's length\nacross--just enough to draw the smoke out, and not enough to let the\nrain in.\n~\nE\nbranches~\nThe branches appear to be taken from willow trees.  About a dozen of\nthem rise around the edge of the cirular shelter, and are tied with\ntwine where they meet at the top.\n~\nE\nhide walls skins~\nThe hides appear to be from a wide variety of animals.  Large skins,\nmost likely from wolves and bears, form the majority of the structure,\nand smaller skins have been used to fill the gaps.  Overall, the work\nis excellent.\n~\nS\n#17248\nA collapsed building.~\nAs you push your way into the building the wall supports give way and\nthe roof collapses in upon you!  You're trapped!\n~\n0 ACD 0\nE\nup down roof floor ceiling west north south east door north wall~\nThe weight of the ceiling has smashed your head tightly against the\nground, making it impossible to look around.  You're screwed.\n~\nS\n#17249\nThe trail leading out of Shadowvale.~\nThe trail leads east into a small village hidden within the edge of\nthe forest.  To the west the forest thins and eventually fades altogether.\nSquirrels and other wildlife play in the light cover near the trail, and\nyou can hear the chatter of birds in the surrounding canopy.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17246\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail looks well-travelled to the east toward town, but fades here\nand can't be seen to the west.\n~\nE\nwest~\nThe forest thins to the west, but you can't make out the lands beyond.\nThe trail ends here, however, so there can't be too much out there . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe sun breaks through the canopy in many places, leaving misty trails\nas it seeks out the ground below.  You notice the eerie contrast with\nthe forest to the east, which quickly becomes dark and menacing.\n~\nE\nnorth south forest~\nThe forest around you consists of random trees scattered among a low\ncovering of bushes and vines.  It has a rather cheerful feel about it,\nand you note a wide range of scents in the air.\n~\nS\n#17250\nA small clearing in the woods.~\nA small clearing has been created just behind the shacks along this\nrow.  Piles of garbage sit rotting along the edge of the forest, which\ncloses quickly in against the southern and western edges of the lot.\nThere are signs of a trail entering the underbrush to the west, but it\nis difficult to make out where it might go.  The back door of a shack\nlies to your east, and the remains of a fallen building lie north.\n~\n0 0 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17242\nD1\nExit ~\nback door east~\n16387 0 17231\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nE\ndown~\nThe clearing is covered in a soft, green turf.  If it weren't for the\nstink of rotting garbage, it'd be a nice place to rest for awhile.\n~\nE\nup~\nNo trees grow in the lot, and the refreshing glow of sunlight enhances\nthe area.  You can tell from the canopy though that this might be the only\nsunny spot for some distance in any direction.\n~\nE\ntrail west~\nThere appears to be a path leading into the forest at the western edge\nof the clearing, but the undergrowth is so heavy it is hard to be sure.\n~\nE\npile garbage~\nIt looks as if someone has been tossing the remains of meals, and perhaps\nworse, along the edges of this lot.  Even if there was something of value\nburied deep in there, you doubt it's worth enough to dig around and find\nit.\n~\nE\nback door east~\nThe door is simply a variety of random boards and planks tied together\nwith string and vines.  Nice effort, but certainly better at keeping\nout the wind than hearty adventurers like yourself.\n~\nS\n#17251\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail plunges into the forest, and the vegetation immediately\npresses in against you.  It appears that the trail continues south, and\nreturns east to the clearing.\n~\n0 A 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17250\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17252\nE\ndown trail~\nThe ground is covered in vegetation, and vines reach out to snag your\nfeet and armor.  The trail is faint, but after a few seconds you can\nsee that it clearly goes south, if anywhere . . ..\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest above is so thick that light can hardly penetrate.  The\nlower branches are covered in vines, and you can't see any further into\nthe forest in this direction than in any other.\n~\nE\nwest north forest underbrush~\nThe undergrowth is thick in this part of the forest.  You think the\nbacks of the buildings along the main trail should be to your north, but\nit is impossible to see more than several feet into the vegetation.\nThe trail is the only possible means of passage through this area.\n~\nS\n#17252\nA brush-covered trail in the woods.~\nThe trail comes to an end at the forest edge.  Vegetation presses in\nfrom the south, east and west preventing further passage.  A strange bush\nprotruding from the forest edge to the west captures your attention.\n~\n0 A 3\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17251\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17253\nE\ndown~\nThick sod, covered in leaves and decaying branches, covers the forest\nfloor.  You feel you should watch carefully where you are walking so\nas not to entangle yourself in the vines.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe trees grow low over the path, and the vines growing from the\nbranches hang just out of reach.  A wave of claustrophobia overcomes\nyou, and you feel the urge to turn and run.\n~\nE\nsouth east forest underbrush~\nThe underbrush almost reaches out from the forest to draw you in.  You\nhear the cries of a wide variety of wildlife from beyond the edge of the\ntrees, but you can't imagine what would live in such darkness.  You can't,\nthat's for sure . . . you might as well turn around and head back.\n~\nE\nhandle~\nThe handle is too deep in the bush to see.  Perhaps if you opened\nthe bush . . . \n~\nE\nmetal inside~\nThere appears to be a fence inside the bush.  As you investigate further,\nyou notice that the bush gives slightly under your weight.  You feel what\ncould be a handle of some sort . . .\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nAt first glance, the bush appears to be dying.  The leaves have all\ndried out, and the whole thing seems to almost sway and flap in the wind\n . . . almost as if it were hanging.  You see the faint glint of sunlight\nstriking metal deep inside.\n~\nS\n#17253\nThe hidden hut.~\nYou've gained entrance to a hut hidden within the underbrush at the\nedge of the forest.  It is constructed primarily of sod, and has the feel\nof an igloo--but it obviously wasn't built for comfort.  It is clearly\na temporary hideout of some sort, and amenities aren't apparently a\npriority to the owner.\n~\n0 ACDKT 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor bush~\n16387 0 17252\nE\ndown floor~\nSomeone has made an effort to at least pack the dirt on the ground into\nsomething resembling a floor.  Grass still grows in places, but it isn't\ndoing well in the absence of sunlight.\n~\nE\ndoor bush~\nFrom the inside, you can see that someone has simply uprooted an\nentire bush and built a wire door frame through the middle.  The bush\nthen hangs from the frame, and from the outside, appears to still be\nhappily anchored in the soil.  You admire the genius that came up with\nthis idea.\n~\nE\n~\nGeneric extended description.\n~\nE\nup branches vines~\nThe branches and vines that form the ceiling provide an interesting\nmaze at which to stare while you lie on your back awaiting sleep.\n~\nE\nwalls west south north sod~\nThe sod was cut from the ground and stacked into piles about 8 feet in\nheight.  A series of branches were added across the top of the room, and\nvines were allowed to grow across them as a \"roof\".  Not exactly the\nbuilding materials you'd choose for a honeymoon suite, but they serve\ntheir current purpose well . . . finding and getting into this hut is\ncertainly a challenge.\n~\nS\n#17254\nA path in the forest.~\nThe forest deepens to the west, and appears nearly impassable.  The trail\ncontinues in that direction though, as well as returning to the east.  The\nvegetation presses in from the north and south.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17200\nS\n#17255\nA path through the forest.~\nThe path leads west from here, directly into the heart of the darkest\npart of the forest.  You notice an odd \"stillness\" about the trail in\nthat direction.  The forest pushes in from the south and east, preventing\npassage in those directions altogether.  To the north, the forest thins\nconsiderably.\n~\n0 0 3\nH 200 M 200\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17256\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17254\nE\nsouth east forest vegetation~\nYou note that the trees are becoming larger and older as you move to\nthe west.  Thick underbrush and massive vines block passage to the south\nand east, forcing the trail to turn to the west and north.\n~\nE\nup~\nBeams of sunlight burst through the canopy above, giving the forest about\nyou an eerie glow.  You can see that as you move west, the light disappears\ncompletely, and to the east the forest appears to be thinner.\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail turns north and west here, forced to change course by the\nthickening underbrush.\n~\nS\n#17256\nThe path into the forest.~\nThe forest rises in a thick wall to the west.  Large vines and thick\nunderbrush provide an eerie backdrop to the deepeing darkness in that\ndirection.  The trail continues south, plunging into the edge of the\ndeeper woods, and to the east leads to a crossroads.\n~\n0 0 3\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 3510\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 17255\nE\nnorth west vines underbrush forest~\nWhile the forest to the east is relatively clear, the forest to the\nwest is a mass of vegetation.  Thick, dark tree trunks rise far above you\nand squeak with a menacing tone as they sway in wind.  Large vines and\nbrambles grow between them, creating an impenetrable mass.  You can't\nimagine what kind of creatures would make their homes here.\n~\nE\nup~\nThe forest seems to lean over you from the west, almost as it if plans\nto engulf you as a lunchtime snack.  The sun still finds the occasional\nhole to poke through here, but you can see it's having much better luck\nto the east.  Perhaps you would too . . ..\n~\nE\ndown trail~\nThe trail thins as it enters the forest to the south, but the hard-\npacked dirt suggests that it does, in fact, get travelled.

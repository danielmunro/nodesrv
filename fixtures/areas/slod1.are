instead of pure magic, \nspecialized into fighting arts also, which is so brutal. At first\nWe tried to keep them from leaving into other planes so they wouldn't\nlose their perspective to the true power. But as usual, Power and money\nis too luring for most to keep their mind in magic. As thei arrived into\nplane of Boinga, they realized they could easily enough stop their\nvictims muscles from working and this way gain the edge against the\nmost powerful fighters in Boinga. Learned in fighting skills, as they\nwere to defend us from invanders at first, they now possess the most\ndevastating power and we can only pray that they dont use it wrong\nagainst poor living creatures of Boinga.\n~\nE\n2~\nWe have given possibility to move between the planes to few students\nwho did show their excellence in wizardry. To them we taught the\nthe travelling skill and name Nethermancers. As to restrict their\npowers, We took away from them the possibility to protect themselves\nwith few armors.

instead of pure magic, \nspecialized into fighting arts also, which is so brutal. At first\nWe tried to keep them from leaving into other planes so they wouldn't\nlose their perspective to the true power. But as usual, Power and money\nis too luring for most to keep their mind in magic. As thei arrived into\nplane of Boinga, they realized they could easily enough stop their\nvictims muscles from working and this way gain the edge against the\nmost powerful fighters in Boinga. Learned in fighting skills, as they\nwere to defend us from invanders at first, they now possess the most\ndevastating power and we can only pray that they dont use it wrong\nagainst poor living creatures of Boinga.\n~\nE\n2~\nWe have given possibility to move between the planes to few students\nwho did show their excellence in wizardry. To them we taught the\nthe travelling skill and name Nethermancers. As to restrict their\npowers, We took away from them the possibility to protect themselves\nwith few armors. To compensate this a little, We have decided to bless\ntheir Weapons with special ability, so they can survive in suffering\nworld of boinga\n~\nE\nchapter 1~\n{CChapter 1\n{x \nFrom early ages we have found the way to move between planes and found \nnew plane where we can create safe institute of learning away from\nterror of normal people of Boinga. Our main goal was to build only \nuniversity in this plane where anyone interested in magic and proven\nworthy could come and learn to more powerful aspects of magic. Years\nwent by and we found ourselves sleeping on the floors of class rooms, so\nonly one conclusion was possible since we were not under hurry to leave\nour safe harbor, to build houses for our students.\n~\n#23550\nCauldron~\nHuge black Cauldron~\nHuge black cauldron stands in the middle of the room~\nunknown~\nforge ABGRTY 0\n18 19 20 21 0\n0 6500 0 P\n#23551\nlong steel chain~\na Long steel chain~\nThere is a chain of somekind on the ground, covered in dust.~\nsteel~\ntrap_part FPQT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n44 50 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 M\n#23552\nsmall spikes~\na handfull of small spikes~\nThere is a handfull of spikes on the ground, dropped by an assassin. better not step on 'em!~\nunknown~\ntrap_part FPQT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n44 50 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 M\n#23553\nWand Mental blast~\na Wand of {wmental blast{x~\nThere is a staff of somekind on the ground.~\nElf spine~\nwand AG AO\n49 10 8 'psionic blast' 0\n44 50 10000 P\n#23554\npiece paper~\na piece of paper~\na piece of paper is laying on the ground gathering dust~\npaper~\ntrash FGHQ AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 P\nE\nPaper writing~\nHerbs can be used to create various potions by undead\nWhich is odd since We have tried to learn to create the very same\nthings that these undead people create without success. \n~\n#23555\nportal~\na portal~\n~\nspace~\nportal OTY 0\n0 0 0 23646 0\n0 10000 0 P\nE\neast~\nIt's pitch black, but something definately is in east\n~\n#23556\npan pipe~\na set of pan pipes~\nSet of pipes is on the ground gathering dust, what a shame.~\nwood~\nwand ABFGT AO\n51 2 2 'sleep' 0\n48 10 1000 P\nA\n1 -3\n#23557\nwand control~\na Wand of control~\na plain wooden stick is on the ground~\nwood~\nwand ABFG AO\n51 2 2 'charm person' 0\n48 50 5000 P\n#23558\ngolden key~\na small golden key~\nthe golden key is gathering dust here~\ngold~\nkey ABFG AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n51 100 0 P\nF\nA 0 0 K\n#23559\nskull key~\na skeleton key~\nA bone lies here.~\nbone~\nkey 0 A\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 50 0 P\n#23560\npaper scroll~\na Scroll of travel~\nsmall piece of paper is on the ground~\nmutant hide~\nscroll FQTUd AO\n43 'traveler fog' 'teleport' '' ''\n32 10 100 P\n#23561\npaper scroll~\na scroll of re-animation~\nsmall piece of paper is on the ground~\nvolare hide~\nscroll FQTUd AO\n51 'animate dead' '' '' ''\n51 10 100 P\n#23562\nwand protection~\na wand of protection~\na plain wooden stick is on the ground~\nwood~\nwand ABFG AO\n29 11 9 'protection neutral' 0\n48 50 5000 P\n#23563\nempty bottle~\nan empty potion bottle~\nan empty bottle is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n0 '' '' '' ''\n0 10 100 P\n#23564\nsmall blue herb~\na small blue herb~\na small blue herb grows here~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n55 'flamestrike' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23565\nsmall blue herb~\na small blue herb~\na small blue herb grows here~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n55 'slow' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23566\nred herb~\na small red herb~\na small red herb grows here on a small bush~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n55 'energy drain' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23567\nred herb~\na small red herb~\na small red herb grows here on a small bush~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n29 'water breathing' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23568\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n49 'bless' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23569\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n52 'cancellation' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23570\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n52 'frenzy' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23571\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n48 'withstand death' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23572\npiece paper~\na piece of paper~\na piece of paper is laying on the ground gathering dust~\npaper~\ntrash FGHQ AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 P\nE\npaper writing~\nUs{Rcses{x  {Rgszsz{xrch to meld {Rggs{xike i \nto chai{RGsseEs{x   .

instead of pure magic, \nspecialized into fighting arts also, which is so brutal. At first\nWe tried to keep them from leaving into other planes so they wouldn't\nlose their perspective to the true power. But as usual, Power and money\nis too luring for most to keep their mind in magic. As thei arrived into\nplane of Boinga, they realized they could easily enough stop their\nvictims muscles from working and this way gain the edge against the\nmost powerful fighters in Boinga. Learned in fighting skills, as they\nwere to defend us from invanders at first, they now possess the most\ndevastating power and we can only pray that they dont use it wrong\nagainst poor living creatures of Boinga.\n~\nE\n2~\nWe have given possibility to move between the planes to few students\nwho did show their excellence in wizardry. To them we taught the\nthe travelling skill and name Nethermancers. As to restrict their\npowers, We took away from them the possibility to protect themselves\nwith few armors.

But as usual, Power and money\nis too luring for most to keep their mind in magic. As thei arrived into\nplane of Boinga, they realized they could easily enough stop their\nvictims muscles from working and this way gain the edge against the\nmost powerful fighters in Boinga. Learned in fighting skills, as they\nwere to defend us from invanders at first, they now possess the most\ndevastating power and we can only pray that they dont use it wrong\nagainst poor living creatures of Boinga.","We have given possibility to move between the planes to few students\nwho did show their excellence in wizardry. To them we taught the\nthe travelling skill and name Nethermancers. As to restrict their\npowers, We took away from them the possibility to protect themselves\nwith few armors. To compensate this a little, We have decided to bless\ntheir Weapons with special ability, so they can survive in suffering\nworld of boinga","{CChapter 1\n{x \nFrom early ages we have found the way to move between planes and found \nnew plane where we can create safe institute of learning away from\nterror of normal people of Boinga. Our main goal was to build only \nuniversity in this plane where anyone interested in magic and proven\nworthy could come and learn to more powerful aspects of magic. Years\nwent by and we found ourselves sleeping on the floors of class rooms, so\nonly one conclusion was possible since we were not under hurry to leave\nour safe harbor, to build houses for our students."],"material":"Elf hide","type":"trash","extraFlag":"FGHTUYd","wearFlag":"AO","pObjFlags":"0 0 0 0

instead of pure magic, \nspecialized into fighting arts also, which is so brutal. At first\nWe tried to keep them from leaving into other planes so they wouldn't\nlose their perspective to the true power. But as usual, Power and money\nis too luring for most to keep their mind in magic. As thei arrived into\nplane of Boinga, they realized they could easily enough stop their\nvictims muscles from working and this way gain the edge against the\nmost powerful fighters in Boinga. Learned in fighting skills, as they\nwere to defend us from invanders at first, they now possess the most\ndevastating power and we can only pray that they dont use it wrong\nagainst poor living creatures of Boinga.\n~\nE\n2~\nWe have given possibility to move between the planes to few students\nwho did show their excellence in wizardry. To them we taught the\nthe travelling skill and name Nethermancers. As to restrict their\npowers, We took away from them the possibility to protect themselves\nwith few armors.

instead of pure magic, \nspecialized into fighting arts also, which is so brutal. At first\nWe tried to keep them from leaving into other planes so they wouldn't\nlose their perspective to the true power. But as usual, Power and money\nis too luring for most to keep their mind in magic. As thei arrived into\nplane of Boinga, they realized they could easily enough stop their\nvictims muscles from working and this way gain the edge against the\nmost powerful fighters in Boinga. Learned in fighting skills, as they\nwere to defend us from invanders at first, they now possess the most\ndevastating power and we can only pray that they dont use it wrong\nagainst poor living creatures of Boinga.\n~\nE\n2~\nWe have given possibility to move between the planes to few students\nwho did show their excellence in wizardry. To them we taught the\nthe travelling skill and name Nethermancers. As to restrict their\npowers, We took away from them the possibility to protect themselves\nwith few armors. To compensate this a little, We have decided to bless\ntheir Weapons with special ability, so they can survive in suffering\nworld of boinga\n~\nE\nchapter 1~\n{CChapter 1\n{x \nFrom early ages we have found the way to move between planes and found \nnew plane where we can create safe institute of learning away from\nterror of normal people of Boinga. Our main goal was to build only \nuniversity in this plane where anyone interested in magic and proven\nworthy could come and learn to more powerful aspects of magic. Years\nwent by and we found ourselves sleeping on the floors of class rooms, so\nonly one conclusion was possible since we were not under hurry to leave\nour safe harbor, to build houses for our students.\n~\n#23550\nCauldron~\nHuge black Cauldron~\nHuge black cauldron stands in the middle of the room~\nunknown~\nforge ABGRTY 0\n18 19 20 21 0\n0 6500 0 P\n#23551\nlong steel chain~\na Long steel chain~\nThere is a chain of somekind on the ground, covered in dust.~\nsteel~\ntrap_part FPQT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n44 50 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 M\n#23552\nsmall spikes~\na handfull of small spikes~\nThere is a handfull of spikes on the ground, dropped by an assassin. better not step on 'em!~\nunknown~\ntrap_part FPQT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n44 50 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 M\n#23553\nWand Mental blast~\na Wand of {wmental blast{x~\nThere is a staff of somekind on the ground.~\nElf spine~\nwand AG AO\n49 10 8 'psionic blast' 0\n44 50 10000 P\n#23554\npiece paper~\na piece of paper~\na piece of paper is laying on the ground gathering dust~\npaper~\ntrash FGHQ AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 P\nE\nPaper writing~\nHerbs can be used to create various potions by undead\nWhich is odd since We have tried to learn to create the very same\nthings that these undead people create without success. \n~\n#23555\nportal~\na portal~\n~\nspace~\nportal OTY 0\n0 0 0 23646 0\n0 10000 0 P\nE\neast~\nIt's pitch black, but something definately is in east\n~\n#23556\npan pipe~\na set of pan pipes~\nSet of pipes is on the ground gathering dust, what a shame.~\nwood~\nwand ABFGT AO\n51 2 2 'sleep' 0\n48 10 1000 P\nA\n1 -3\n#23557\nwand control~\na Wand of control~\na plain wooden stick is on the ground~\nwood~\nwand ABFG AO\n51 2 2 'charm person' 0\n48 50 5000 P\n#23558\ngolden key~\na small golden key~\nthe golden key is gathering dust here~\ngold~\nkey ABFG AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n51 100 0 P\nF\nA 0 0 K\n#23559\nskull key~\na skeleton key~\nA bone lies here.~\nbone~\nkey 0 A\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 50 0 P\n#23560\npaper scroll~\na Scroll of travel~\nsmall piece of paper is on the ground~\nmutant hide~\nscroll FQTUd AO\n43 'traveler fog' 'teleport' '' ''\n32 10 100 P\n#23561\npaper scroll~\na scroll of re-animation~\nsmall piece of paper is on the ground~\nvolare hide~\nscroll FQTUd AO\n51 'animate dead' '' '' ''\n51 10 100 P\n#23562\nwand protection~\na wand of protection~\na plain wooden stick is on the ground~\nwood~\nwand ABFG AO\n29 11 9 'protection neutral' 0\n48 50 5000 P\n#23563\nempty bottle~\nan empty potion bottle~\nan empty bottle is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n0 '' '' '' ''\n0 10 100 P\n#23564\nsmall blue herb~\na small blue herb~\na small blue herb grows here~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n55 'flamestrike' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23565\nsmall blue herb~\na small blue herb~\na small blue herb grows here~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n55 'slow' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23566\nred herb~\na small red herb~\na small red herb grows here on a small bush~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n55 'energy drain' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23567\nred herb~\na small red herb~\na small red herb grows here on a small bush~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n29 'water breathing' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23568\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n49 'bless' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23569\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n52 'cancellation' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23570\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n52 'frenzy' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23571\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n48 'withstand death' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23572\npiece paper~\na piece of paper~\na piece of paper is laying on the ground gathering dust~\npaper~\ntrash FGHQ AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 P\nE\npaper writing~\nUs{Rcses{x  {Rgszsz{xrch to meld {Rggs{xike i \nto chai{RGsseEs{x   .

instead of pure magic, \nspecialized into fighting arts also, which is so brutal. At first\nWe tried to keep them from leaving into other planes so they wouldn't\nlose their perspective to the true power. But as usual, Power and money\nis too luring for most to keep their mind in magic. As thei arrived into\nplane of Boinga, they realized they could easily enough stop their\nvictims muscles from working and this way gain the edge against the\nmost powerful fighters in Boinga. Learned in fighting skills, as they\nwere to defend us from invanders at first, they now possess the most\ndevastating power and we can only pray that they dont use it wrong\nagainst poor living creatures of Boinga.\n~\nE\n2~\nWe have given possibility to move between the planes to few students\nwho did show their excellence in wizardry. To them we taught the\nthe travelling skill and name Nethermancers. As to restrict their\npowers, We took away from them the possibility to protect themselves\nwith few armors. To compensate this a little, We have decided to bless\ntheir Weapons with special ability, so they can survive in suffering\nworld of boinga\n~\nE\nchapter 1~\n{CChapter 1\n{x \nFrom early ages we have found the way to move between planes and found \nnew plane where we can create safe institute of learning away from\nterror of normal people of Boinga.

instead of pure magic, \nspecialized into fighting arts also, which is so brutal. At first\nWe tried to keep them from leaving into other planes so they wouldn't\nlose their perspective to the true power. But as usual, Power and money\nis too luring for most to keep their mind in magic. As thei arrived into\nplane of Boinga, they realized they could easily enough stop their\nvictims muscles from working and this way gain the edge against the\nmost powerful fighters in Boinga. Learned in fighting skills, as they\nwere to defend us from invanders at first, they now possess the most\ndevastating power and we can only pray that they dont use it wrong\nagainst poor living creatures of Boinga.\n~\nE\n2~\nWe have given possibility to move between the planes to few students\nwho did show their excellence in wizardry. To them we taught the\nthe travelling skill and name Nethermancers. As to restrict their\npowers, We took away from them the possibility to protect themselves\nwith few armors. To compensate this a little, We have decided to bless\ntheir Weapons with special ability, so they can survive in suffering\nworld of boinga\n~\nE\nchapter 1~\n{CChapter 1\n{x \nFrom early ages we have found the way to move between planes and found \nnew plane where we can create safe institute of learning away from\nterror of normal people of Boinga. Our main goal was to build only \nuniversity in this plane where anyone interested in magic and proven\nworthy could come and learn to more powerful aspects of magic. Years\nwent by and we found ourselves sleeping on the floors of class rooms, so\nonly one conclusion was possible since we were not under hurry to leave\nour safe harbor, to build houses for our students.\n~\n#23550\nCauldron~\nHuge black Cauldron~\nHuge black cauldron stands in the middle of the room~\nunknown~\nforge ABGRTY 0\n18 19 20 21 0\n0 6500 0 P\n#23551\nlong steel chain~\na Long steel chain~\nThere is a chain of somekind on the ground, covered in dust.~\nsteel~\ntrap_part FPQT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n44 50 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 M\n#23552\nsmall spikes~\na handfull of small spikes~\nThere is a handfull of spikes on the ground, dropped by an assassin. better not step on 'em!~\nunknown~\ntrap_part FPQT AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n44 50 5000 P\nF\nA 0 0 M\n#23553\nWand Mental blast~\na Wand of {wmental blast{x~\nThere is a staff of somekind on the ground.~\nElf spine~\nwand AG AO\n49 10 8 'psionic blast' 0\n44 50 10000 P\n#23554\npiece paper~\na piece of paper~\na piece of paper is laying on the ground gathering dust~\npaper~\ntrash FGHQ AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 P\nE\nPaper writing~\nHerbs can be used to create various potions by undead\nWhich is odd since We have tried to learn to create the very same\nthings that these undead people create without success. \n~\n#23555\nportal~\na portal~\n~\nspace~\nportal OTY 0\n0 0 0 23646 0\n0 10000 0 P\nE\neast~\nIt's pitch black, but something definately is in east\n~\n#23556\npan pipe~\na set of pan pipes~\nSet of pipes is on the ground gathering dust, what a shame.~\nwood~\nwand ABFGT AO\n51 2 2 'sleep' 0\n48 10 1000 P\nA\n1 -3\n#23557\nwand control~\na Wand of control~\na plain wooden stick is on the ground~\nwood~\nwand ABFG AO\n51 2 2 'charm person' 0\n48 50 5000 P\n#23558\ngolden key~\na small golden key~\nthe golden key is gathering dust here~\ngold~\nkey ABFG AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n51 100 0 P\nF\nA 0 0 K\n#23559\nskull key~\na skeleton key~\nA bone lies here.~\nbone~\nkey 0 A\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 50 0 P\n#23560\npaper scroll~\na Scroll of travel~\nsmall piece of paper is on the ground~\nmutant hide~\nscroll FQTUd AO\n43 'traveler fog' 'teleport' '' ''\n32 10 100 P\n#23561\npaper scroll~\na scroll of re-animation~\nsmall piece of paper is on the ground~\nvolare hide~\nscroll FQTUd AO\n51 'animate dead' '' '' ''\n51 10 100 P\n#23562\nwand protection~\na wand of protection~\na plain wooden stick is on the ground~\nwood~\nwand ABFG AO\n29 11 9 'protection neutral' 0\n48 50 5000 P\n#23563\nempty bottle~\nan empty potion bottle~\nan empty bottle is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n0 '' '' '' ''\n0 10 100 P\n#23564\nsmall blue herb~\na small blue herb~\na small blue herb grows here~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n55 'flamestrike' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23565\nsmall blue herb~\na small blue herb~\na small blue herb grows here~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n55 'slow' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23566\nred herb~\na small red herb~\na small red herb grows here on a small bush~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n55 'energy drain' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23567\nred herb~\na small red herb~\na small red herb grows here on a small bush~\nunknown~\npill Gd AO\n29 'water breathing' '' '' ''\n18 1 0 P\n#23568\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n49 'bless' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23569\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n52 'cancellation' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23570\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n52 'frenzy' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23571\npink potion~\na pink potion~\nan potion is on the ground~\nglass~\npotion Gd AO\n48 'withstand death' '' '' ''\n44 10 100 P\n#23572\npiece paper~\na piece of paper~\na piece of paper is laying on the ground gathering dust~\npaper~\ntrash FGHQ AO\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 P\nE\npaper writing~\nUs{Rcses{x  {Rgszsz{xrch to meld {Rggs{xike i \nto chai{RGsseEs{x   .

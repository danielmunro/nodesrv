The sounds of this majestic\nfortress ring clearly in your ears as a great Dragon roar rattles\nthe floor from above.  If it wasn't for the noise, you wouldn't\nhave guessed anyone had been here in years.  The walls, the ceiling, \nthe whole hallway is imaculate; such seamless Ivory fills your vision\nand you are unable to determine where this hallway even ends.\nHaving seen what you came to see, it may be a good idea to leave before\nthat rumbling grows any louder.\n~\n0 DT 0\nB 20727\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 31713\nS\n#31728\nNike's {DChamber{x of Solitude~\nLocated in the Deepest Depths of the Avarice hall lies\nNike's Chamber of Solitude.

When it clicks closed,\nsuccessive torches lining the walls {Yilluminate{x and project enough\n{Rfire{Ylight{x to reveal the contents of the room.  At the far end\nof the den you notice an alcove with a lowered ceiling.  A {Dblack{x\nsatin pillow sits inside, and there appears to be enough room to sit quietly\nand meditate, contemplating the outside world.\n \nAlong the walls of this rectangular room are tapestries and paintings\nof times long past.

You find yourself\nlooking down upon a hidden Herb garden, flourishing beautifully\naside the Waterfall flowing into the Dark Forest.  The floor is still \nstone beneath you, but it seems to have become transparent as it reveals\nmore of this forest.  Leaning over the edge of the Waterfall you peer down\ninto the dense trees, looking deep into the foliage  you swear you can see\nsomething moving.  A shadow of something...relaxing your eye's you gaze \nfurtherinto the brush and a yinn like creature emerges from behind a tree and\nthan perhaps catching wind of danger, vanishes again into the bushes.\nOff in the distance you notice the foundation of a very large castle.\nYou think you can see movement through the windows of the castle but you\ncan't be certain.

The sounds of this majestic\nfortress ring clearly in your ears as a great Dragon roar rattles\nthe floor from above.  If it wasn't for the noise, you wouldn't\nhave guessed anyone had been here in years.  The walls, the ceiling, \nthe whole hallway is imaculate; such seamless Ivory fills your vision\nand you are unable to determine where this hallway even ends.\nHaving seen what you came to see, it may be a good idea to leave before\nthat rumbling grows any louder.\n~\n0 DT 0\nB 20727\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 31713\nS\n#31728\nNike's {DChamber{x of Solitude~\nLocated in the Deepest Depths of the Avarice hall lies\nNike's Chamber of Solitude.

You find yourself\nlooking down upon a hidden Herb garden, flourishing beautifully\naside the Waterfall flowing into the Dark Forest.  The floor is still \nstone beneath you, but it seems to have become transparent as it reveals\nmore of this forest.  Leaning over the edge of the Waterfall you peer down\ninto the dense trees, looking deep into the foliage  you swear you can see\nsomething moving.  A shadow of something...relaxing your eye's you gaze \nfurtherinto the brush and a yinn like creature emerges from behind a tree and\nthan perhaps catching wind of danger, vanishes again into the bushes.\nOff in the distance you notice the foundation of a very large castle.\nYou think you can see movement through the windows of the castle but you\ncan't be certain.

Leaning over the edge of the Waterfall you peer down\ninto the dense trees, looking deep into the foliage  you swear you can see\nsomething moving.  A shadow of something...relaxing your eye's you gaze \nfurtherinto the brush and a yinn like creature emerges from behind a tree and\nthan perhaps catching wind of danger, vanishes again into the bushes.\nOff in the distance you notice the foundation of a very large castle.\nYou think you can see movement through the windows of the castle but you\ncan't be certain.  You begind to wonder if the creature knows a way up the \nWaterfall, perhaps now would be a good time to leave.\n~\n0 T 0\nB 12048\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16387 0 31716\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nO 0 31717 100 31711\t* the hideous monster\nO 0 31716 100 31711\t* the filthiest toilet you've ever seen\nD 0 31709   1 16385\t* The Rogues Grotto east\nD 0 31711   2 16385\t* The Idiot Stick King's Bedroom south\nD 0 31718   5 16384\t* Inside a Great Tree down\nD 0 31722   3 16387\t* Above a Watchtower west\nD 0 31723   4 16387\t* The Eyes of the Wind up\nD 0 31706   0 16385\t* A Glimmering Hallway north\nD 0 31706   2 16384\t* A Glimmering Hallway south\nD 0 31706   3 16385\t* A Glimmering Hallway west\nD 0 31706   4 16387\t* A Glimmering Hallway up\nD 0 31706   5 16387\t* A Glimmering Hallway down\nD 0 31724   3 16387\t* The Waterfall Cavern west\nD 0 31707   0 16384\t* A Glimmering Hallway north\nD 0 31707   1 16387\t* A Glimmering Hallway east\nD 0 31707   2 16384\t* A Glimmering Hallway south\nO 0 31726 100 31715\t* A statue of Imposter\nO 0 31724 100 31715\t* Staue of Slodhian the Re-Re-Re-Re-Re-Reborn Pet Thief\nD 0 31715   4 16387\t* Den of Thieves up\nO 0 31727 100 31728\t* a Single Ray of Light\nD 0 31728   4 16387\t* Nike's {DChamber{x of Solitude up\nO 0 31728 100 31729\t* A {Dblack{x satin pillow\nD 0 31729   3 16387\t* The {CSecluded Meditation Chambers{x of the {GGreat Monk{x west\nD 0 31714   4 16387\t* Avarice's Secret Sanctuary up\nD 0 31704   3 16384\t* The Gate west\nM 0 31702   1 31700  1\t* An Assassin\nD 0 31700   0 16384\t* The Entrance way to the Alcazar of the Avarice Guild north\nD 0 31700   1 16384\t* The Entrance way to the Alcazar of the Avarice Guild east\nD 0 31700   5 16387\t* The Entrance way to the Alcazar of the Avarice Guild down\nM 0 31700   1 31701  1\t* Sister Fyria\nE 1 31708  -1    3\t*   Diamond Crucifix\nE 1 31707  -1   12\t*   a long Black Robe\nO 0 31700 100 31701\t* the fire\nD 0 31701   0 16384\t* The Treasure Chamber north\nD 0 31701   1 16384\t* The Treasure Chamber east\nD 0 31701   2 16384\t* The Treasure Chamber south\nD 0 31701   3 16384\t* The Treasure Chamber west\nD 0 31701   5 20583\t* The Treasure Chamber down\nD 0 31705   1 16387\t* Avarice's Secret Hoard east\nD 0 31705   4 20583\t* Avarice's Secret Hoard up\nD 0 31705   5 16387\t* Avarice's Secret Hoard down\nD 0 31713   0 16384\t* Behind the Aura of Rejuvenation north\nD 0 31713   1 16384\t* Behind the Aura of Rejuvenation east\nD 0 31713   2 16487\t* Behind the Aura of Rejuvenation south\nD 0 31713   3 16385\t* Behind the Aura of Rejuvenation west\nD 0 31713   4 16384\t* Behind the Aura of Rejuvenation up\nD 0 31713   5 16384\t* Behind the Aura of Rejuvenation down\nO 0 31725 100 31716\t* A slab of granite\nD 0 31716   0 28739\t* A Glittering Hallway north\nD 0 31716   2 16384\t* A Glittering Hallway south\nD 0 31716   4 16387\t* A Glittering Hallway up\nD 0 31717   1 16387\t* Avarice's Private Library east\nD 0 31717   2 28739\t* Avarice's Private Library south\nD 0 31717   4 16384\t* Avarice's Private Library up\nM 0 31703   1 31702  1\t* Thief\nE 1 31729  -1   17\t*   Wand of {GVenom{x\nO 0 31722 100 31702\t* the Aura of Rejuvenation\nD 0 31702   0 16487\t* Aura of Rejuvenation north\nD 0 31702   2 16384\t* Aura of Rejuvenation south\nD 0 31702   5 16387\t* Aura of Rejuvenation down\nD 0 31708   0 16384\t* A Glimmering Hallway north\nD 0 31708   5 16391\t* A Glimmering Hallway down\nM 0 31704   1 31710  1\t* Berserked goblin\nO 0 31076 100 31710\t* the cow's udder\nO 0 31715 100 31710\t* the fire\nD 0 31710   4 16391\t* The Lair of The Berzerking Goblin up\nM 0 31701   1 31703  1\t* Alren the Shopkeeper\nG 1 31732  -1     \t*   a dragon scale\nG 1 31730  -1     \t*   the tooth of Gluckdrache\nE 1 31706  -1   18\t*   a pitch-black sack\nE 1 31705  -1   17\t*   a black cloak\nE 1 31704  -1   16\t*   a standard issue club\nE 1 31703  -1   12\t*   a tight blue shirt\nE 1 31702  -1    5\t*   a shoulder length red cape\nE 1 31701  -1    7\t*   fitted blue pants\nG 1 31723  -1     \t*   Ensign of Avarice\nG 1 31731  -1     \t*   The Shadow spear\nD 0 31703   1 16384\t* The Extravagant Alcove east\nS\n\n#SHOPS\n31700  0  0  0  0  0 \t  50  50 \t 0 24 \t* Sister Fyria\n31701  0  0  0  0  0 \t 600 100 \t 0 23 \t* Alren the Shopkeeper\n0\n\n#SPECIALS\nM 31702 spec_thief          \t* An Assassin\nM 31703 spec_thief          \t* Thief\nM 31704 spec_cast_cleric    \t* Berserked goblin\nS\n\n#$\n","position":32855},"values":[{"header":"SPECIALS","command":"M","id":"31702","special":"spec_thief","comment":"* An Assassin"},{"command":"M","id":"31703","special":"spec_thief","comment":"* Thief"},{"command":"M","id":"31704","special":"spec_cast_cleric","comment":"* Berserked goblin"}]}]

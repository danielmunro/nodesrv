However one must have a clue as to the creatures\nthat live in the destination area.  The following list\nhas been compiled by the sages of Warlock to aid the\ntraveller in this regard.  First some cautions for the\nnew Astral traveler.\n \n  1) Do not gate to an area you cannot handle!\n  2) The creature may be dead.  Thus your gate spell will fail.\n  3) A malicious renegade can summon your target creature\n     elsewhere to trap you.\n  4) The target creature may be cursed.  Your spell will fail.\n  5) The target creature may be charmed.  Your spell will fail.\n \n  Much of this information is also useful for the portal and\nnexus spells.  These spells are often under-utilized.  You \nmay wish to reflect on their use in your practice of magick.\n~\nE\nsilver1~\nArea                          Gate Post\n============================  ======================\nAltirin Forest                None\nArachnos                      Young spider\nAspen Penal Colony            Link angel\nAstral/Githyanki              Githzerai\nAvarice Clan Hall             Herald\nBalance Clan Hall             None\nBanshee                       None\nBathe House                   Desk clerk\nBluetspur                     Geist, jiakan, illithid\nBuccaneer Bay                 ?\nCamelot                       Black knight\nCampgrounds                   Faerie\nCastle Camorra                Apparition\nCastle Delain                 Delain guard\nCastle Trinity                Young warrior\nChapel Catacombs              Etcher\nChurch of Matook              None\nCity of Atlantis              Fido fish\nCity of Thieves               Cockroach\nCrescent Beach                Crane\nCuthbert's Fief               Firbolg\n~\nE\nsilver2~\nDangerous Neighborhood        Gang\nDen of Thieves                Guardian thief\nDescent to Hell               Coins, nose, weeds, burning fool, \n                              female construction worker, jury\nDragon Tower                  Draconian fool\nDrow City                     Drow commoner\nDwarven Catacombs             Grand templar\nDwarven Day Care              Doll\nDwarven Kingdom               None\nDylan's Area                  Harpy\nElemental Canyon              Bandit\nElemental Planes              ?\nElven High Court              None\nElven Printing Co             Printer\nEmerald Forest                Porcupine\nEnchanted Lake                Heap\nForbidden City                Fanatic\n~\nE\nsilver3~\nGalaxy                        Cepheus\nGhoul Forest                  Sassy, hungry ghoul\nGladiator Arena               None\nGnome Village                 Gnome child\nGraveyard                     ?\nGreat Pyramid                 Tomb\nGypsy Camp                    Bruno\nHall of Clan Bane             None\nHall of Ennoble               ?\nHall of the Apocalypse        None\nHaon Dor                      Warg\nHaunted House                 Rocking horse\nHigh Tower of Sorcery         Ezmerelda\nHoly Grove                    Hierophant\nIn the Air                    Faerie dragon\nIvory Stronghold              Dove\nKeep of Mahn-Tor              Tyrgoth\nKender Village                Kender mayor\n~\nE\nsilver4~\nLegion Clan Hall              None\nLimbo                         ?\nLost Bog                      None\nLost Catacombs                ?\nLost Ways                     ?\nLycanthropia                  Pooh\nMachine Dreams                None\nMega-City One                 Futsie\nMiden'nir                     Dark horseman\nMidgaard                      Vagabond\nMob Factory                   Toxic slime\nMoonstone Inn                 None\nMoria                         ?\nMystgar's Domain              Tetraps\nNew Ofcol                     Diana       \nNew Thalos                    Vulture\nNirvana                       None\nNottingham                    Merry man           \nNova Veesa                    3.bandit\n~\nE\nsilver5~\nOfcol                         Jacklyn\nOld Hall of Clan Circle       Circle guardian\nOld Marsh                     None\nOld Thalos                    Lamia\nOlympus                       Pegasus\nOrcs' Lair                    Orc leader\nPakat                         Indian fido\nPlains of the North           Sorbus, Aruncus\nPlane of Time                 Egg timer, split second, bedtime\nRainforest                    Crocodile\nRedferne's Residence          Grand knight\nSands of Sorrow               Scorpion\nSea of Serenity               None\nSecret Tomb                   Jade\nSewer                         Herald, 7.wererat etc\nShadowvale                    None\nShire                         Thain\nSmurf Village                 Smurfette\nSri Raji                      Indian fido\nStormy Mountain               Satyr\nSwimming Hole                 Beaver?\n~\nE\nsilver6~\nTemple o' Evil                Clan warrior\nTenochtitlan                  Aztec guard\nThalos                        Beholder\nTheatre of Boinga             Hamlet\nTroll Den                     None\nUnderSmurf                    None\nValley of the Elves           Antelope\nVillage Fair                  Baloo\nWarlock Clan Hall             Circle guardian, desk clerk\nWhore House                   (see city of thieves)\nWooster                       Security\nWyvern River                  Will-o-wisp\nWyvern's Tower                Black pudding, Elite gargoyle\nZealot Clan Hall              Sorbus, Aruncus\n \n============================================================\n~\nE\nsilverend~\nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

Some\nof our ancestors learned how to weave magical energies. \nUnfortunately, those who have been blessed with magic \nare also threatened by both renegades, and by those \nwho would seek to destroy those who are more powerful \nthan themselves.  To defend themselves against these \nrenegades, the magi have long ago developed an Art of War.\n{x\nAnazar of the Black Robes of Warlock passes along key\npoints in this art.\n~\nE\nwar1~\nKnow Your Enemy - Before you begin any pfight, always know who \nyou are fighting with.  Most races/remorts have a certain vulnerability \nwhich you can use against them in combat.  For example, you can use \nweapons with the \"flame\" noun to vuln yinns and if you are a mage/wizard, \nthe \"incinerate\" spell will also hurt them.  Also look at their class.  \nRealize that you will probably have a more difficult time casting a \nsleep spell on a berzerker than you would on a warrior for example.  \nThe mage who knows his or her opponent before battle will have a \nmuch easier time coming out of that battle alive.\n \n~\nE\nwar2~\nUse Your Spells As An Advantage - First and foremost, you \nare a caster.  You don't rely on hits like a fighter or stealth \nlike a thief.  You rely on your magic.  Use this to your ability.  \nDestroy your opponent with spells, catch them off-guard with your \nmagic.  If you choose to rely only on your hits to kill an enemy, \nbeing a caster, you will have a much harder fight on your hands.\n~\nE\nwar3~\nKnow When to Flee - A good fighter always knows his limits.  \nKnow yours.  There are a variety of things you can do to know \nwhen to flee.  Wimpy can help you automatically flee when you \nare very hurt.  Also, being mages, you have a variety of ways \nto escape combat besides just fleeing.  If you are a cleric \nclass, the \"mirror image\" spell in the psionics group will \nenable you to leave the room you were previously fighting in, \nwhile your opponent fights a temporary mirror image he thinks \nis you.  If you are an elementalist, nodes are meant to make \nyour life much easier.  Use them to your advantage.  Choose \nwisely when you pick a location to make your node as once you \ndo pick one, you won't be able to change your mind.  For other \ncasters, besides just spamming flee, you can use the transportation \ngroup to assist you.  Both the teleport and gate spells can help \nyou with this.  However, if you want to use one of these spells \nIN combat, use gate.  If you flee and then use a spell, you can \nuse either gate or teleport.  Do not try to use teleport in combat \nas its chances of succeeding are low and you will most likely fail.  \nYou can also try to use the recall spell in or out of combat.  \nCertain magical items such as wearing a compass, or quaffing a \njar of blood, may also assist you in escaping a fight.  Your \nlast option is to use deity gifts.  If you are pledge Hermes \nand have enough sac points, you can pray transport (if you aren't \ncursed) and this will be similar to casting teleport.  A better \noption than casting 'word of recall' would be to pray recall.  \nIf you cast 'word of recall' then you have some spell lag, and \nyour opponent may be able to catch you because of this.  Pray \nrecall however has no lag.  Once you pray for it, you arrive \ninstantly at Hassan, and can then walk quickly to your hall or \nto a place of safety.\n~\nE\nwar4~\nUse Your Class' Advantages - Every magic-using class has \nits own advantages.  For example, cleric classes can heal \nthemselves, wizards cast powerful maledictions, and elementalists \nhave a variety of interesting nature spells.  Learn how to use \nyour class effectively.  Learn its weaknesses and its strengths, \nas both of these will hurt and help you in combat.\n~\nE\nwar5~\nUse Spells Which Are Special To Your Class - Every caster \nclass has certain spells which only he or she can use.  For \nexample, crusaders have hold person elementalists have earthbind, \nand wizards have sleep.  Both of these spells can be used to \ncompletely immobilize your opponent for a period of time.  This \ncan give you the chance to maladict them or to call for other \nmethods of aid to assist in killing them.  However, be warned \nbefore using these spells.  Each of these will have a certain \nspell lag time if you fail.  During this lag time, your opponent \nwill be made aware of the fact that you have tried to kill him or \nher, and will thus attack you.  If you are at low health, do not \ntry to cast one of these spells unless you are certain you will \nnot fail it.\n~\nE\nwar6~\nFor Necromancers - If you are a class with necromancy (every \ncaster class but elementalists) then ALWAYS use withstand death.  \nIf you are leveling, if you are out gathering funds, even if \nyou go into town to spell someone up, always have withstand \ndeath on.  This spell will enable you to \"cheat\" death.  Once \nyou have died, you will immediately return with a small percentage \nof your hp, giving you another chance to flee from your opponent.\n~\nE\nwar7~\nHealing In Combat - Healing while fighting is always a good \nidea.  For cleric classes, the healing group is very useful.  \nHowever, in order to conserve mana, if you are outside of \ncombat (i.e. flee then gate to a safe spot to heal) use the \n'cure critical' spell on yourself.  This spell, although it \nheals less hit points, also helps you to conserve your mana.  \nIf you are in combat, use the heal spell for quick hit point \nregeneration.  Also, gain the curative class.  This will enable \nyou to heal basic maledictions - poison, plague, and blindness.  \nIf you are a mage class, things are more difficult for you.  \nIt might be wise to carry around potions of cure serious (available \nfor sale at most clan hall shops).  Certain staves, wands, other \npotions, and pills also have healing abilities which can grant \nyou some health regeneration in combat.\n~\nE\nwar8~\nMaladict Your Enemy - As a caster, you most likely will not \nbe able to match a fighter when you compare your hit points \nand hits to his.  To even out combat, use maledictions.  For \nelementalists, you have a variety of powerful nature spells \nsuch as asphyxiate and irradiate which can make your opponent \nmuch weaker in combat.  For all other classes, the maledictions \ngroup will serve you well.  Poison and plague will slowly drain \naway an opponents health and mana, respectively, weaken will \nlower their strength attribute, blindess will take away their \nvision temporarily, curse will cause their deity to turn his \neyes from them, and energy drain, when it lands, helps you to \ndrain their mana and movement points.\n~\nE\nwar9~\nHunting - If you wish to hunt your opponent, take a few \nfactors into account.  Are they leveling? If so, what alignment \nare they?  What possible places could they be leveling in?  If \nthey are not leveling, use gate points to search around places \nwhere they could be gathering funds and also check town occasionally.  \nIf you're lucky, you may be able to catch them as they recall \nor return to their halls.\n~\nE\nwarend~\nThese tips are only a small portion of the true Art of War.  \nUse these to fight, but do not rely on them completely.  Every \nmage has his or her own way of combat.  With enough pkilling \nexperience, you will find yours.  Benefit from your mistakes, \nlearn from your errors, and remember, always defend the magic.\n{x\n  This work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

It reads:\n \n\"Those who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect.

It falls to the red robes to help make it so as\nwe are the ones in the middle bridging the gap between white and\nblack.  Our primary goals as red robes are spelled out in the \ncharter:\n \n  1) Recruiting \n  2) Fund raising\n \nWe have secondary goals as well:\n \n  1) Assist black robes with punishment and retributions when\n     needed and feasible. (optional)\n  2) Assist white robes with research, equipping, and advising\n     young casters. (optional)\n  3) Keep up to date on clan activities and be a source of information\n     for other clan members. (required)\n~\nE\nredrobeleader~\nThis is a /5 position.

However, this item does not exist in \nthis world in a form useful to us; instead, it has to be created.\n \nFirstly, a container suitable for the creation of this item is needed - the \nbinding kit.  This can be found on the Master Spell Binder in the High Tower of\nSorcery (gate master binder).  The first step towards creating a scroll is to \nstart with a blank one first; St. Bob's Map Shop has a large supply of blank \nscrolls at affordable prices.  In order for the scroll to have its binding \nproperties, the acquisition of a thread of binding silk from one of the \nnumerous spiders in this world which carry it is imperative.  Trying to track \ndown one of these can be laborious, so it is suggested to select the Queen \nSpider.  Finally, something is needed out of which the arcane symbols will be \nformed on the scroll.  A bottle of ink will not suffice as the magic held \nwithin the symbols will cause the ink to combust, destroying the scroll.  \nInstead, two diamonds need to be used.\n \nPlace the blank scroll, the thread of binding silk and the two diamonds into \nthe binding kit and head to the forge at the Midgaard Armourer. Type \"forge \nkit\" to set the magic in motion.  The two diamonds will shatter and the dust \nand the thread will merge into the blank scroll, forming the Scroll of Binding,\nretrievable from the binding kit.\n~\nE\nwiz2~\nThe cost of researching adamantite skin and incinerate is not cheap; they need \nsix eggs and eight eggs respectively.  The ingredients needed aren't the eggs \nthough, but sapphires formed from the eggs.  The Midgaard Jeweller possesses a \ncrucible which he has on sale which is needed to form the sapphires.  Although \nthis item is relatively cheap compared to the price of research, it wouldn't \nhurt to ask around to see if someone has one that they aren't using.\n \nSapphires are made at the forge at the Midgaard Armourer.  Place the required \nnumber of eggs into the jeweller's crucible and type \"forge crucible\".  The \neggs are then fused together to form the different sapphires.  Adamantite skin \nrequires two reflective sapphires made from three eggs each, while incinerate \nuses two fire sapphires made from four eggs each.\n \nFor more information reguarding the creation of sapphires, refer to the \nNovice's Guide to Jewelcraft, on sale at the Midgaard Jeweller when in stock.\n~\nE\nwiz3~\nIn order to research adamantite skin and incinerate, wizards need to be trained in this \nskill.  However, practicing research is fairly difficult and, considering the price of \nthese two spells, failure is costly.\nResearch can be practiced up to 95% and if you intend using it, it is advisable to get \nit this high.  If you don't wish to use all your practice sessions on research, ask if \nsomeone else in the clan can do it for you.  If you wish to do it yourself, take the \nfollowing into account:\n \nIntelligence at 20 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 21 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 22 increases research by 7% per prac.\nIntelligence at 23 increases research by 8% per prac.\nIntelligence at 24 increases research by 10% per prac.\nIntelligence at 25 increases research by 10% per prac.\nThis only applies when research is below 75%.  Any practice used after this only \nincreases it by 1%.  For this reason, you could attempt to save a practice session of \ntwo by reducing your intelligence to reach 74% to get the maximum out of your sessions.\n~\nE\nwiz4~\nAdamantite skin is the most powerful spell wizards can use to defend \nthemselves.  It is only available from level 50 at a cost of 150 mana and comes\nwith a considerable casting delay, but has an initial duration of 25 to 26 \nhours (casting level / 2 rounded down).  Each hit you deflect reduces the \nduration by 2 hours.\n \nTo create the scroll of adamantite skin, a scroll of binding, two reflective \nsapphires and a bar of adamantite are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for \ndetails on the scroll and sapphires.)  The bar of adamantite can be found north\nof the Master Enchanter in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The bar of adamantite and the sapphires \nwill begin fusing together while the binding forces are extended from the \nscroll.  When fused, the bar and sapphires will explode and, if the binding \nforces were aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy released will \nbe bound into the scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of \nadamantite skin.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz5~\nIncinerate is the fire version of acid blast, and most useful for making crispy\nyinns.  It is only available from level 38 at a cost of 50 mana.\n \nTo create the scroll of incineration, a scroll of binding, two fire sapphires \nand a rune of fire are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for details on the \nscroll and sapphires.)  The rune of fire can be found on the Greater Fire Demon\nin the depths of hell.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The fire sapphires will burst into \nflames to be absorbed by the rune of fire, causing the rune to harden and \nshatter.  The dust will then merge with the binding forces from the scroll and,\nif aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy will be bound into the \nscroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of incineration.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz6~\nNot all of the advanced spells have to be researched.  Steel skin and diamond \nskin can be found in Boinga, but these are nowhere near as powerful as \nadamanatite skin.\n \nSteel skin is available from level 35 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nmoderate casting delay, and has an initial duration of a mere 7 to 10 hours \n(casting level / 5 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on the steel \nclam, in Buccaneer Bay.\n \nDiamond skin is available from level 45 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nlengthy casting delay, and has an initial duration of 15 to 17 hours (casting \nlevel / 3 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on a diamond golem two \nrooms east and one room south of Ezmeralda in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nBoth these spells are copied in a magelab by holding the spell page and using \nthe \"copyspell\" command.  Each hit you deflect reduces the duration by 2 hours.\n~\nE\nwiz7~\nRivalling acid blast and incinerate, two new spells can be found; sunburst and\nsonic blast.\n \nSunburst is available from level 44 at a cost of 65 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast, but does light damage which can blind \nyour victim.  The spell page is found on the s'lu master in Altirin.\n \nSonic blast is available from level 45 at a cost of 75 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast as well, but has a chance to stun your \nvictim for a round or two.  The spell page is found on the yinnish monk in \nAltirin.\n~\nE\nwiz8~\nNot all combat spells come in the form of something that can do damage \ndirectly.  Some come in maladictive form, as is the case with flameseek.\n \nFlameseek is available from level 40 at a cost of 75 mana, and imparts a fire \nvuln on your victim.  Its affects will stay with your victim for 2 to 3 hours. \nThe spell page is found on the elemental guardian at the entrance to the \nElemental Plane of Fire.\n \nUsed in conjunction with fireball or incinerate, flameseek may result in \nseveral charred remains.  Welding torches and flamewhips also\nare handy with this spell.  Use this spell on slept victims,\nor to initiate combat.\n~\nE\nwizend~\nThis work covers a subject that is continually changing.\nFuture editions will be produced to cover what is learned in \nthe future.  Perhaps *your* work will be included.\nBenefit from your mistakes, learn from your errors, and \nremember, always defend the magic.\n \nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However one must have a clue as to the creatures\nthat live in the destination area.  The following list\nhas been compiled by the sages of Warlock to aid the\ntraveller in this regard.  First some cautions for the\nnew Astral traveler.\n \n  1) Do not gate to an area you cannot handle!\n  2) The creature may be dead.  Thus your gate spell will fail.\n  3) A malicious renegade can summon your target creature\n     elsewhere to trap you.\n  4) The target creature may be cursed.  Your spell will fail.\n  5) The target creature may be charmed.  Your spell will fail.\n \n  Much of this information is also useful for the portal and\nnexus spells.  These spells are often under-utilized.  You \nmay wish to reflect on their use in your practice of magick.\n~\nE\nsilver1~\nArea                          Gate Post\n============================  ======================\nAltirin Forest                None\nArachnos                      Young spider\nAspen Penal Colony            Link angel\nAstral/Githyanki              Githzerai\nAvarice Clan Hall             Herald\nBalance Clan Hall             None\nBanshee                       None\nBathe House                   Desk clerk\nBluetspur                     Geist, jiakan, illithid\nBuccaneer Bay                 ?\nCamelot                       Black knight\nCampgrounds                   Faerie\nCastle Camorra                Apparition\nCastle Delain                 Delain guard\nCastle Trinity                Young warrior\nChapel Catacombs              Etcher\nChurch of Matook              None\nCity of Atlantis              Fido fish\nCity of Thieves               Cockroach\nCrescent Beach                Crane\nCuthbert's Fief               Firbolg\n~\nE\nsilver2~\nDangerous Neighborhood        Gang\nDen of Thieves                Guardian thief\nDescent to Hell               Coins, nose, weeds, burning fool, \n                              female construction worker, jury\nDragon Tower                  Draconian fool\nDrow City                     Drow commoner\nDwarven Catacombs             Grand templar\nDwarven Day Care              Doll\nDwarven Kingdom               None\nDylan's Area                  Harpy\nElemental Canyon              Bandit\nElemental Planes              ?\nElven High Court              None\nElven Printing Co             Printer\nEmerald Forest                Porcupine\nEnchanted Lake                Heap\nForbidden City                Fanatic\n~\nE\nsilver3~\nGalaxy                        Cepheus\nGhoul Forest                  Sassy, hungry ghoul\nGladiator Arena               None\nGnome Village                 Gnome child\nGraveyard                     ?\nGreat Pyramid                 Tomb\nGypsy Camp                    Bruno\nHall of Clan Bane             None\nHall of Ennoble               ?\nHall of the Apocalypse        None\nHaon Dor                      Warg\nHaunted House                 Rocking horse\nHigh Tower of Sorcery         Ezmerelda\nHoly Grove                    Hierophant\nIn the Air                    Faerie dragon\nIvory Stronghold              Dove\nKeep of Mahn-Tor              Tyrgoth\nKender Village                Kender mayor\n~\nE\nsilver4~\nLegion Clan Hall              None\nLimbo                         ?\nLost Bog                      None\nLost Catacombs                ?\nLost Ways                     ?\nLycanthropia                  Pooh\nMachine Dreams                None\nMega-City One                 Futsie\nMiden'nir                     Dark horseman\nMidgaard                      Vagabond\nMob Factory                   Toxic slime\nMoonstone Inn                 None\nMoria                         ?\nMystgar's Domain              Tetraps\nNew Ofcol                     Diana       \nNew Thalos                    Vulture\nNirvana                       None\nNottingham                    Merry man           \nNova Veesa                    3.bandit\n~\nE\nsilver5~\nOfcol                         Jacklyn\nOld Hall of Clan Circle       Circle guardian\nOld Marsh                     None\nOld Thalos                    Lamia\nOlympus                       Pegasus\nOrcs' Lair                    Orc leader\nPakat                         Indian fido\nPlains of the North           Sorbus, Aruncus\nPlane of Time                 Egg timer, split second, bedtime\nRainforest                    Crocodile\nRedferne's Residence          Grand knight\nSands of Sorrow               Scorpion\nSea of Serenity               None\nSecret Tomb                   Jade\nSewer                         Herald, 7.wererat etc\nShadowvale                    None\nShire                         Thain\nSmurf Village                 Smurfette\nSri Raji                      Indian fido\nStormy Mountain               Satyr\nSwimming Hole                 Beaver?\n~\nE\nsilver6~\nTemple o' Evil                Clan warrior\nTenochtitlan                  Aztec guard\nThalos                        Beholder\nTheatre of Boinga             Hamlet\nTroll Den                     None\nUnderSmurf                    None\nValley of the Elves           Antelope\nVillage Fair                  Baloo\nWarlock Clan Hall             Circle guardian, desk clerk\nWhore House                   (see city of thieves)\nWooster                       Security\nWyvern River                  Will-o-wisp\nWyvern's Tower                Black pudding, Elite gargoyle\nZealot Clan Hall              Sorbus, Aruncus\n \n============================================================\n~\nE\nsilverend~\nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

Some\nof our ancestors learned how to weave magical energies. \nUnfortunately, those who have been blessed with magic \nare also threatened by both renegades, and by those \nwho would seek to destroy those who are more powerful \nthan themselves.  To defend themselves against these \nrenegades, the magi have long ago developed an Art of War.\n{x\nAnazar of the Black Robes of Warlock passes along key\npoints in this art.\n~\nE\nwar1~\nKnow Your Enemy - Before you begin any pfight, always know who \nyou are fighting with.  Most races/remorts have a certain vulnerability \nwhich you can use against them in combat.  For example, you can use \nweapons with the \"flame\" noun to vuln yinns and if you are a mage/wizard, \nthe \"incinerate\" spell will also hurt them.  Also look at their class.  \nRealize that you will probably have a more difficult time casting a \nsleep spell on a berzerker than you would on a warrior for example.  \nThe mage who knows his or her opponent before battle will have a \nmuch easier time coming out of that battle alive.\n \n~\nE\nwar2~\nUse Your Spells As An Advantage - First and foremost, you \nare a caster.  You don't rely on hits like a fighter or stealth \nlike a thief.  You rely on your magic.  Use this to your ability.  \nDestroy your opponent with spells, catch them off-guard with your \nmagic.  If you choose to rely only on your hits to kill an enemy, \nbeing a caster, you will have a much harder fight on your hands.\n~\nE\nwar3~\nKnow When to Flee - A good fighter always knows his limits.  \nKnow yours.  There are a variety of things you can do to know \nwhen to flee.  Wimpy can help you automatically flee when you \nare very hurt.  Also, being mages, you have a variety of ways \nto escape combat besides just fleeing.  If you are a cleric \nclass, the \"mirror image\" spell in the psionics group will \nenable you to leave the room you were previously fighting in, \nwhile your opponent fights a temporary mirror image he thinks \nis you.  If you are an elementalist, nodes are meant to make \nyour life much easier.  Use them to your advantage.  Choose \nwisely when you pick a location to make your node as once you \ndo pick one, you won't be able to change your mind.  For other \ncasters, besides just spamming flee, you can use the transportation \ngroup to assist you.  Both the teleport and gate spells can help \nyou with this.  However, if you want to use one of these spells \nIN combat, use gate.  If you flee and then use a spell, you can \nuse either gate or teleport.  Do not try to use teleport in combat \nas its chances of succeeding are low and you will most likely fail.  \nYou can also try to use the recall spell in or out of combat.  \nCertain magical items such as wearing a compass, or quaffing a \njar of blood, may also assist you in escaping a fight.  Your \nlast option is to use deity gifts.  If you are pledge Hermes \nand have enough sac points, you can pray transport (if you aren't \ncursed) and this will be similar to casting teleport.  A better \noption than casting 'word of recall' would be to pray recall.  \nIf you cast 'word of recall' then you have some spell lag, and \nyour opponent may be able to catch you because of this.  Pray \nrecall however has no lag.  Once you pray for it, you arrive \ninstantly at Hassan, and can then walk quickly to your hall or \nto a place of safety.\n~\nE\nwar4~\nUse Your Class' Advantages - Every magic-using class has \nits own advantages.  For example, cleric classes can heal \nthemselves, wizards cast powerful maledictions, and elementalists \nhave a variety of interesting nature spells.  Learn how to use \nyour class effectively.  Learn its weaknesses and its strengths, \nas both of these will hurt and help you in combat.\n~\nE\nwar5~\nUse Spells Which Are Special To Your Class - Every caster \nclass has certain spells which only he or she can use.  For \nexample, crusaders have hold person elementalists have earthbind, \nand wizards have sleep.  Both of these spells can be used to \ncompletely immobilize your opponent for a period of time.  This \ncan give you the chance to maladict them or to call for other \nmethods of aid to assist in killing them.  However, be warned \nbefore using these spells.  Each of these will have a certain \nspell lag time if you fail.  During this lag time, your opponent \nwill be made aware of the fact that you have tried to kill him or \nher, and will thus attack you.  If you are at low health, do not \ntry to cast one of these spells unless you are certain you will \nnot fail it.\n~\nE\nwar6~\nFor Necromancers - If you are a class with necromancy (every \ncaster class but elementalists) then ALWAYS use withstand death.  \nIf you are leveling, if you are out gathering funds, even if \nyou go into town to spell someone up, always have withstand \ndeath on.  This spell will enable you to \"cheat\" death.  Once \nyou have died, you will immediately return with a small percentage \nof your hp, giving you another chance to flee from your opponent.\n~\nE\nwar7~\nHealing In Combat - Healing while fighting is always a good \nidea.  For cleric classes, the healing group is very useful.  \nHowever, in order to conserve mana, if you are outside of \ncombat (i.e. flee then gate to a safe spot to heal) use the \n'cure critical' spell on yourself.  This spell, although it \nheals less hit points, also helps you to conserve your mana.  \nIf you are in combat, use the heal spell for quick hit point \nregeneration.  Also, gain the curative class.  This will enable \nyou to heal basic maledictions - poison, plague, and blindness.  \nIf you are a mage class, things are more difficult for you.  \nIt might be wise to carry around potions of cure serious (available \nfor sale at most clan hall shops).  Certain staves, wands, other \npotions, and pills also have healing abilities which can grant \nyou some health regeneration in combat.\n~\nE\nwar8~\nMaladict Your Enemy - As a caster, you most likely will not \nbe able to match a fighter when you compare your hit points \nand hits to his.  To even out combat, use maledictions.  For \nelementalists, you have a variety of powerful nature spells \nsuch as asphyxiate and irradiate which can make your opponent \nmuch weaker in combat.  For all other classes, the maledictions \ngroup will serve you well.  Poison and plague will slowly drain \naway an opponents health and mana, respectively, weaken will \nlower their strength attribute, blindess will take away their \nvision temporarily, curse will cause their deity to turn his \neyes from them, and energy drain, when it lands, helps you to \ndrain their mana and movement points.\n~\nE\nwar9~\nHunting - If you wish to hunt your opponent, take a few \nfactors into account.  Are they leveling? If so, what alignment \nare they?  What possible places could they be leveling in?  If \nthey are not leveling, use gate points to search around places \nwhere they could be gathering funds and also check town occasionally.  \nIf you're lucky, you may be able to catch them as they recall \nor return to their halls.\n~\nE\nwarend~\nThese tips are only a small portion of the true Art of War.  \nUse these to fight, but do not rely on them completely.  Every \nmage has his or her own way of combat.  With enough pkilling \nexperience, you will find yours.  Benefit from your mistakes, \nlearn from your errors, and remember, always defend the magic.\n{x\n  This work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However, this item does not exist in \nthis world in a form useful to us; instead, it has to be created.\n \nFirstly, a container suitable for the creation of this item is needed - the \nbinding kit.  This can be found on the Master Spell Binder in the High Tower of\nSorcery (gate master binder).  The first step towards creating a scroll is to \nstart with a blank one first; St. Bob's Map Shop has a large supply of blank \nscrolls at affordable prices.  In order for the scroll to have its binding \nproperties, the acquisition of a thread of binding silk from one of the \nnumerous spiders in this world which carry it is imperative.  Trying to track \ndown one of these can be laborious, so it is suggested to select the Queen \nSpider.  Finally, something is needed out of which the arcane symbols will be \nformed on the scroll.  A bottle of ink will not suffice as the magic held \nwithin the symbols will cause the ink to combust, destroying the scroll.  \nInstead, two diamonds need to be used.\n \nPlace the blank scroll, the thread of binding silk and the two diamonds into \nthe binding kit and head to the forge at the Midgaard Armourer. Type \"forge \nkit\" to set the magic in motion.  The two diamonds will shatter and the dust \nand the thread will merge into the blank scroll, forming the Scroll of Binding,\nretrievable from the binding kit.\n~\nE\nwiz2~\nThe cost of researching adamantite skin and incinerate is not cheap; they need \nsix eggs and eight eggs respectively.  The ingredients needed aren't the eggs \nthough, but sapphires formed from the eggs.  The Midgaard Jeweller possesses a \ncrucible which he has on sale which is needed to form the sapphires.  Although \nthis item is relatively cheap compared to the price of research, it wouldn't \nhurt to ask around to see if someone has one that they aren't using.\n \nSapphires are made at the forge at the Midgaard Armourer.  Place the required \nnumber of eggs into the jeweller's crucible and type \"forge crucible\".  The \neggs are then fused together to form the different sapphires.  Adamantite skin \nrequires two reflective sapphires made from three eggs each, while incinerate \nuses two fire sapphires made from four eggs each.\n \nFor more information reguarding the creation of sapphires, refer to the \nNovice's Guide to Jewelcraft, on sale at the Midgaard Jeweller when in stock.\n~\nE\nwiz3~\nIn order to research adamantite skin and incinerate, wizards need to be trained in this \nskill.  However, practicing research is fairly difficult and, considering the price of \nthese two spells, failure is costly.\nResearch can be practiced up to 95% and if you intend using it, it is advisable to get \nit this high.  If you don't wish to use all your practice sessions on research, ask if \nsomeone else in the clan can do it for you.  If you wish to do it yourself, take the \nfollowing into account:\n \nIntelligence at 20 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 21 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 22 increases research by 7% per prac.\nIntelligence at 23 increases research by 8% per prac.\nIntelligence at 24 increases research by 10% per prac.\nIntelligence at 25 increases research by 10% per prac.\nThis only applies when research is below 75%.  Any practice used after this only \nincreases it by 1%.  For this reason, you could attempt to save a practice session of \ntwo by reducing your intelligence to reach 74% to get the maximum out of your sessions.\n~\nE\nwiz4~\nAdamantite skin is the most powerful spell wizards can use to defend \nthemselves.  It is only available from level 50 at a cost of 150 mana and comes\nwith a considerable casting delay, but has an initial duration of 25 to 26 \nhours (casting level / 2 rounded down).  Each hit you deflect reduces the \nduration by 2 hours.\n \nTo create the scroll of adamantite skin, a scroll of binding, two reflective \nsapphires and a bar of adamantite are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for \ndetails on the scroll and sapphires.)  The bar of adamantite can be found north\nof the Master Enchanter in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The bar of adamantite and the sapphires \nwill begin fusing together while the binding forces are extended from the \nscroll.  When fused, the bar and sapphires will explode and, if the binding \nforces were aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy released will \nbe bound into the scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of \nadamantite skin.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz5~\nIncinerate is the fire version of acid blast, and most useful for making crispy\nyinns.  It is only available from level 38 at a cost of 50 mana.\n \nTo create the scroll of incineration, a scroll of binding, two fire sapphires \nand a rune of fire are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for details on the \nscroll and sapphires.)  The rune of fire can be found on the Greater Fire Demon\nin the depths of hell.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The fire sapphires will burst into \nflames to be absorbed by the rune of fire, causing the rune to harden and \nshatter.  The dust will then merge with the binding forces from the scroll and,\nif aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy will be bound into the \nscroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of incineration.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz6~\nNot all of the advanced spells have to be researched.  Steel skin and diamond \nskin can be found in Boinga, but these are nowhere near as powerful as \nadamanatite skin.\n \nSteel skin is available from level 35 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nmoderate casting delay, and has an initial duration of a mere 7 to 10 hours \n(casting level / 5 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on the steel \nclam, in Buccaneer Bay.\n \nDiamond skin is available from level 45 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nlengthy casting delay, and has an initial duration of 15 to 17 hours (casting \nlevel / 3 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on a diamond golem two \nrooms east and one room south of Ezmeralda in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nBoth these spells are copied in a magelab by holding the spell page and using \nthe \"copyspell\" command.  Each hit you deflect reduces the duration by 2 hours.\n~\nE\nwiz7~\nRivalling acid blast and incinerate, two new spells can be found; sunburst and\nsonic blast.\n \nSunburst is available from level 44 at a cost of 65 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast, but does light damage which can blind \nyour victim.  The spell page is found on the s'lu master in Altirin.\n \nSonic blast is available from level 45 at a cost of 75 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast as well, but has a chance to stun your \nvictim for a round or two.  The spell page is found on the yinnish monk in \nAltirin.\n~\nE\nwiz8~\nNot all combat spells come in the form of something that can do damage \ndirectly.  Some come in maladictive form, as is the case with flameseek.\n \nFlameseek is available from level 40 at a cost of 75 mana, and imparts a fire \nvuln on your victim.  Its affects will stay with your victim for 2 to 3 hours. \nThe spell page is found on the elemental guardian at the entrance to the \nElemental Plane of Fire.\n \nUsed in conjunction with fireball or incinerate, flameseek may result in \nseveral charred remains.  Welding torches and flamewhips also\nare handy with this spell.  Use this spell on slept victims,\nor to initiate combat.\n~\nE\nwizend~\nThis work covers a subject that is continually changing.\nFuture editions will be produced to cover what is learned in \nthe future.  Perhaps *your* work will be included.\nBenefit from your mistakes, learn from your errors, and \nremember, always defend the magic.\n \nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However one must have a clue as to the creatures\nthat live in the destination area.  The following list\nhas been compiled by the sages of Warlock to aid the\ntraveller in this regard.  First some cautions for the\nnew Astral traveler.\n \n  1) Do not gate to an area you cannot handle!\n  2) The creature may be dead.  Thus your gate spell will fail.\n  3) A malicious renegade can summon your target creature\n     elsewhere to trap you.\n  4) The target creature may be cursed.  Your spell will fail.\n  5) The target creature may be charmed.  Your spell will fail.\n \n  Much of this information is also useful for the portal and\nnexus spells.  These spells are often under-utilized.  You \nmay wish to reflect on their use in your practice of magick.\n~\nE\nsilver1~\nArea                          Gate Post\n============================  ======================\nAltirin Forest                None\nArachnos                      Young spider\nAspen Penal Colony            Link angel\nAstral/Githyanki              Githzerai\nAvarice Clan Hall             Herald\nBalance Clan Hall             None\nBanshee                       None\nBathe House                   Desk clerk\nBluetspur                     Geist, jiakan, illithid\nBuccaneer Bay                 ?\nCamelot                       Black knight\nCampgrounds                   Faerie\nCastle Camorra                Apparition\nCastle Delain                 Delain guard\nCastle Trinity                Young warrior\nChapel Catacombs              Etcher\nChurch of Matook              None\nCity of Atlantis              Fido fish\nCity of Thieves               Cockroach\nCrescent Beach                Crane\nCuthbert's Fief               Firbolg\n~\nE\nsilver2~\nDangerous Neighborhood        Gang\nDen of Thieves                Guardian thief\nDescent to Hell               Coins, nose, weeds, burning fool, \n                              female construction worker, jury\nDragon Tower                  Draconian fool\nDrow City                     Drow commoner\nDwarven Catacombs             Grand templar\nDwarven Day Care              Doll\nDwarven Kingdom               None\nDylan's Area                  Harpy\nElemental Canyon              Bandit\nElemental Planes              ?\nElven High Court              None\nElven Printing Co             Printer\nEmerald Forest                Porcupine\nEnchanted Lake                Heap\nForbidden City                Fanatic\n~\nE\nsilver3~\nGalaxy                        Cepheus\nGhoul Forest                  Sassy, hungry ghoul\nGladiator Arena               None\nGnome Village                 Gnome child\nGraveyard                     ?\nGreat Pyramid                 Tomb\nGypsy Camp                    Bruno\nHall of Clan Bane             None\nHall of Ennoble               ?\nHall of the Apocalypse        None\nHaon Dor                      Warg\nHaunted House                 Rocking horse\nHigh Tower of Sorcery         Ezmerelda\nHoly Grove                    Hierophant\nIn the Air                    Faerie dragon\nIvory Stronghold              Dove\nKeep of Mahn-Tor              Tyrgoth\nKender Village                Kender mayor\n~\nE\nsilver4~\nLegion Clan Hall              None\nLimbo                         ?\nLost Bog                      None\nLost Catacombs                ?\nLost Ways                     ?\nLycanthropia                  Pooh\nMachine Dreams                None\nMega-City One                 Futsie\nMiden'nir                     Dark horseman\nMidgaard                      Vagabond\nMob Factory                   Toxic slime\nMoonstone Inn                 None\nMoria                         ?\nMystgar's Domain              Tetraps\nNew Ofcol                     Diana       \nNew Thalos                    Vulture\nNirvana                       None\nNottingham                    Merry man           \nNova Veesa                    3.bandit\n~\nE\nsilver5~\nOfcol                         Jacklyn\nOld Hall of Clan Circle       Circle guardian\nOld Marsh                     None\nOld Thalos                    Lamia\nOlympus                       Pegasus\nOrcs' Lair                    Orc leader\nPakat                         Indian fido\nPlains of the North           Sorbus, Aruncus\nPlane of Time                 Egg timer, split second, bedtime\nRainforest                    Crocodile\nRedferne's Residence          Grand knight\nSands of Sorrow               Scorpion\nSea of Serenity               None\nSecret Tomb                   Jade\nSewer                         Herald, 7.wererat etc\nShadowvale                    None\nShire                         Thain\nSmurf Village                 Smurfette\nSri Raji                      Indian fido\nStormy Mountain               Satyr\nSwimming Hole                 Beaver?\n~\nE\nsilver6~\nTemple o' Evil                Clan warrior\nTenochtitlan                  Aztec guard\nThalos                        Beholder\nTheatre of Boinga             Hamlet\nTroll Den                     None\nUnderSmurf                    None\nValley of the Elves           Antelope\nVillage Fair                  Baloo\nWarlock Clan Hall             Circle guardian, desk clerk\nWhore House                   (see city of thieves)\nWooster                       Security\nWyvern River                  Will-o-wisp\nWyvern's Tower                Black pudding, Elite gargoyle\nZealot Clan Hall              Sorbus, Aruncus\n \n============================================================\n~\nE\nsilverend~\nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

Some\nof our ancestors learned how to weave magical energies. \nUnfortunately, those who have been blessed with magic \nare also threatened by both renegades, and by those \nwho would seek to destroy those who are more powerful \nthan themselves.  To defend themselves against these \nrenegades, the magi have long ago developed an Art of War.\n{x\nAnazar of the Black Robes of Warlock passes along key\npoints in this art.\n~\nE\nwar1~\nKnow Your Enemy - Before you begin any pfight, always know who \nyou are fighting with.  Most races/remorts have a certain vulnerability \nwhich you can use against them in combat.  For example, you can use \nweapons with the \"flame\" noun to vuln yinns and if you are a mage/wizard, \nthe \"incinerate\" spell will also hurt them.  Also look at their class.  \nRealize that you will probably have a more difficult time casting a \nsleep spell on a berzerker than you would on a warrior for example.  \nThe mage who knows his or her opponent before battle will have a \nmuch easier time coming out of that battle alive.\n \n~\nE\nwar2~\nUse Your Spells As An Advantage - First and foremost, you \nare a caster.  You don't rely on hits like a fighter or stealth \nlike a thief.  You rely on your magic.  Use this to your ability.  \nDestroy your opponent with spells, catch them off-guard with your \nmagic.  If you choose to rely only on your hits to kill an enemy, \nbeing a caster, you will have a much harder fight on your hands.\n~\nE\nwar3~\nKnow When to Flee - A good fighter always knows his limits.  \nKnow yours.  There are a variety of things you can do to know \nwhen to flee.  Wimpy can help you automatically flee when you \nare very hurt.  Also, being mages, you have a variety of ways \nto escape combat besides just fleeing.  If you are a cleric \nclass, the \"mirror image\" spell in the psionics group will \nenable you to leave the room you were previously fighting in, \nwhile your opponent fights a temporary mirror image he thinks \nis you.  If you are an elementalist, nodes are meant to make \nyour life much easier.  Use them to your advantage.  Choose \nwisely when you pick a location to make your node as once you \ndo pick one, you won't be able to change your mind.  For other \ncasters, besides just spamming flee, you can use the transportation \ngroup to assist you.  Both the teleport and gate spells can help \nyou with this.  However, if you want to use one of these spells \nIN combat, use gate.  If you flee and then use a spell, you can \nuse either gate or teleport.  Do not try to use teleport in combat \nas its chances of succeeding are low and you will most likely fail.  \nYou can also try to use the recall spell in or out of combat.  \nCertain magical items such as wearing a compass, or quaffing a \njar of blood, may also assist you in escaping a fight.  Your \nlast option is to use deity gifts.  If you are pledge Hermes \nand have enough sac points, you can pray transport (if you aren't \ncursed) and this will be similar to casting teleport.  A better \noption than casting 'word of recall' would be to pray recall.  \nIf you cast 'word of recall' then you have some spell lag, and \nyour opponent may be able to catch you because of this.  Pray \nrecall however has no lag.  Once you pray for it, you arrive \ninstantly at Hassan, and can then walk quickly to your hall or \nto a place of safety.\n~\nE\nwar4~\nUse Your Class' Advantages - Every magic-using class has \nits own advantages.  For example, cleric classes can heal \nthemselves, wizards cast powerful maledictions, and elementalists \nhave a variety of interesting nature spells.  Learn how to use \nyour class effectively.  Learn its weaknesses and its strengths, \nas both of these will hurt and help you in combat.\n~\nE\nwar5~\nUse Spells Which Are Special To Your Class - Every caster \nclass has certain spells which only he or she can use.  For \nexample, crusaders have hold person elementalists have earthbind, \nand wizards have sleep.  Both of these spells can be used to \ncompletely immobilize your opponent for a period of time.  This \ncan give you the chance to maladict them or to call for other \nmethods of aid to assist in killing them.  However, be warned \nbefore using these spells.  Each of these will have a certain \nspell lag time if you fail.  During this lag time, your opponent \nwill be made aware of the fact that you have tried to kill him or \nher, and will thus attack you.  If you are at low health, do not \ntry to cast one of these spells unless you are certain you will \nnot fail it.\n~\nE\nwar6~\nFor Necromancers - If you are a class with necromancy (every \ncaster class but elementalists) then ALWAYS use withstand death.  \nIf you are leveling, if you are out gathering funds, even if \nyou go into town to spell someone up, always have withstand \ndeath on.  This spell will enable you to \"cheat\" death.  Once \nyou have died, you will immediately return with a small percentage \nof your hp, giving you another chance to flee from your opponent.\n~\nE\nwar7~\nHealing In Combat - Healing while fighting is always a good \nidea.  For cleric classes, the healing group is very useful.  \nHowever, in order to conserve mana, if you are outside of \ncombat (i.e. flee then gate to a safe spot to heal) use the \n'cure critical' spell on yourself.  This spell, although it \nheals less hit points, also helps you to conserve your mana.  \nIf you are in combat, use the heal spell for quick hit point \nregeneration.  Also, gain the curative class.  This will enable \nyou to heal basic maledictions - poison, plague, and blindness.  \nIf you are a mage class, things are more difficult for you.  \nIt might be wise to carry around potions of cure serious (available \nfor sale at most clan hall shops).  Certain staves, wands, other \npotions, and pills also have healing abilities which can grant \nyou some health regeneration in combat.\n~\nE\nwar8~\nMaladict Your Enemy - As a caster, you most likely will not \nbe able to match a fighter when you compare your hit points \nand hits to his.  To even out combat, use maledictions.  For \nelementalists, you have a variety of powerful nature spells \nsuch as asphyxiate and irradiate which can make your opponent \nmuch weaker in combat.  For all other classes, the maledictions \ngroup will serve you well.  Poison and plague will slowly drain \naway an opponents health and mana, respectively, weaken will \nlower their strength attribute, blindess will take away their \nvision temporarily, curse will cause their deity to turn his \neyes from them, and energy drain, when it lands, helps you to \ndrain their mana and movement points.\n~\nE\nwar9~\nHunting - If you wish to hunt your opponent, take a few \nfactors into account.  Are they leveling? If so, what alignment \nare they?  What possible places could they be leveling in?  If \nthey are not leveling, use gate points to search around places \nwhere they could be gathering funds and also check town occasionally.  \nIf you're lucky, you may be able to catch them as they recall \nor return to their halls.\n~\nE\nwarend~\nThese tips are only a small portion of the true Art of War.  \nUse these to fight, but do not rely on them completely.  Every \nmage has his or her own way of combat.  With enough pkilling \nexperience, you will find yours.  Benefit from your mistakes, \nlearn from your errors, and remember, always defend the magic.\n{x\n  This work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

It reads:\n \n\"Those who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect. They have also been entrusted with our clan finances.\"\n \nThe aim of this tome is too clarify and organize our sect so \nthat we can better do the job set out in our charter.\n~\nE\nredrobegoals~\nThe white robes of warlock with their more peaceful and inquiring\nnatures stand at one end of the warlock spectrum.  Blackrobes with\ntheir heightened combat skills and ability to deliver punishment\nand retribution stand at the other end of the warlock spectrum.\nWarlock gains strength when we are active across the full spectrum\nof activities.  It falls to the red robes to help make it so as\nwe are the ones in the middle bridging the gap between white and\nblack.  Our primary goals as red robes are spelled out in the \ncharter:\n \n  1) Recruiting \n  2) Fund raising\n \nWe have secondary goals as well:\n \n  1) Assist black robes with punishment and retributions when\n     needed and feasible.

However, this item does not exist in \nthis world in a form useful to us; instead, it has to be created.\n \nFirstly, a container suitable for the creation of this item is needed - the \nbinding kit.  This can be found on the Master Spell Binder in the High Tower of\nSorcery (gate master binder).  The first step towards creating a scroll is to \nstart with a blank one first; St. Bob's Map Shop has a large supply of blank \nscrolls at affordable prices.  In order for the scroll to have its binding \nproperties, the acquisition of a thread of binding silk from one of the \nnumerous spiders in this world which carry it is imperative.  Trying to track \ndown one of these can be laborious, so it is suggested to select the Queen \nSpider.  Finally, something is needed out of which the arcane symbols will be \nformed on the scroll.  A bottle of ink will not suffice as the magic held \nwithin the symbols will cause the ink to combust, destroying the scroll.  \nInstead, two diamonds need to be used.\n \nPlace the blank scroll, the thread of binding silk and the two diamonds into \nthe binding kit and head to the forge at the Midgaard Armourer. Type \"forge \nkit\" to set the magic in motion.  The two diamonds will shatter and the dust \nand the thread will merge into the blank scroll, forming the Scroll of Binding,\nretrievable from the binding kit.\n~\nE\nwiz2~\nThe cost of researching adamantite skin and incinerate is not cheap; they need \nsix eggs and eight eggs respectively.  The ingredients needed aren't the eggs \nthough, but sapphires formed from the eggs.  The Midgaard Jeweller possesses a \ncrucible which he has on sale which is needed to form the sapphires.  Although \nthis item is relatively cheap compared to the price of research, it wouldn't \nhurt to ask around to see if someone has one that they aren't using.\n \nSapphires are made at the forge at the Midgaard Armourer.  Place the required \nnumber of eggs into the jeweller's crucible and type \"forge crucible\".  The \neggs are then fused together to form the different sapphires.  Adamantite skin \nrequires two reflective sapphires made from three eggs each, while incinerate \nuses two fire sapphires made from four eggs each.\n \nFor more information reguarding the creation of sapphires, refer to the \nNovice's Guide to Jewelcraft, on sale at the Midgaard Jeweller when in stock.\n~\nE\nwiz3~\nIn order to research adamantite skin and incinerate, wizards need to be trained in this \nskill.  However, practicing research is fairly difficult and, considering the price of \nthese two spells, failure is costly.\nResearch can be practiced up to 95% and if you intend using it, it is advisable to get \nit this high.  If you don't wish to use all your practice sessions on research, ask if \nsomeone else in the clan can do it for you.  If you wish to do it yourself, take the \nfollowing into account:\n \nIntelligence at 20 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 21 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 22 increases research by 7% per prac.\nIntelligence at 23 increases research by 8% per prac.\nIntelligence at 24 increases research by 10% per prac.\nIntelligence at 25 increases research by 10% per prac.\nThis only applies when research is below 75%.  Any practice used after this only \nincreases it by 1%.  For this reason, you could attempt to save a practice session of \ntwo by reducing your intelligence to reach 74% to get the maximum out of your sessions.\n~\nE\nwiz4~\nAdamantite skin is the most powerful spell wizards can use to defend \nthemselves.  It is only available from level 50 at a cost of 150 mana and comes\nwith a considerable casting delay, but has an initial duration of 25 to 26 \nhours (casting level / 2 rounded down).  Each hit you deflect reduces the \nduration by 2 hours.\n \nTo create the scroll of adamantite skin, a scroll of binding, two reflective \nsapphires and a bar of adamantite are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for \ndetails on the scroll and sapphires.)  The bar of adamantite can be found north\nof the Master Enchanter in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The bar of adamantite and the sapphires \nwill begin fusing together while the binding forces are extended from the \nscroll.  When fused, the bar and sapphires will explode and, if the binding \nforces were aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy released will \nbe bound into the scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of \nadamantite skin.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz5~\nIncinerate is the fire version of acid blast, and most useful for making crispy\nyinns.  It is only available from level 38 at a cost of 50 mana.\n \nTo create the scroll of incineration, a scroll of binding, two fire sapphires \nand a rune of fire are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for details on the \nscroll and sapphires.)  The rune of fire can be found on the Greater Fire Demon\nin the depths of hell.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The fire sapphires will burst into \nflames to be absorbed by the rune of fire, causing the rune to harden and \nshatter.  The dust will then merge with the binding forces from the scroll and,\nif aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy will be bound into the \nscroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of incineration.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz6~\nNot all of the advanced spells have to be researched.  Steel skin and diamond \nskin can be found in Boinga, but these are nowhere near as powerful as \nadamanatite skin.\n \nSteel skin is available from level 35 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nmoderate casting delay, and has an initial duration of a mere 7 to 10 hours \n(casting level / 5 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on the steel \nclam, in Buccaneer Bay.\n \nDiamond skin is available from level 45 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nlengthy casting delay, and has an initial duration of 15 to 17 hours (casting \nlevel / 3 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on a diamond golem two \nrooms east and one room south of Ezmeralda in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nBoth these spells are copied in a magelab by holding the spell page and using \nthe \"copyspell\" command.  Each hit you deflect reduces the duration by 2 hours.\n~\nE\nwiz7~\nRivalling acid blast and incinerate, two new spells can be found; sunburst and\nsonic blast.\n \nSunburst is available from level 44 at a cost of 65 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast, but does light damage which can blind \nyour victim.  The spell page is found on the s'lu master in Altirin.\n \nSonic blast is available from level 45 at a cost of 75 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast as well, but has a chance to stun your \nvictim for a round or two.  The spell page is found on the yinnish monk in \nAltirin.\n~\nE\nwiz8~\nNot all combat spells come in the form of something that can do damage \ndirectly.  Some come in maladictive form, as is the case with flameseek.\n \nFlameseek is available from level 40 at a cost of 75 mana, and imparts a fire \nvuln on your victim.  Its affects will stay with your victim for 2 to 3 hours. \nThe spell page is found on the elemental guardian at the entrance to the \nElemental Plane of Fire.\n \nUsed in conjunction with fireball or incinerate, flameseek may result in \nseveral charred remains.  Welding torches and flamewhips also\nare handy with this spell.  Use this spell on slept victims,\nor to initiate combat.\n~\nE\nwizend~\nThis work covers a subject that is continually changing.\nFuture editions will be produced to cover what is learned in \nthe future.  Perhaps *your* work will be included.\nBenefit from your mistakes, learn from your errors, and \nremember, always defend the magic.\n \nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

This altar has been used for centuries by clerics\nto learn new spells from their gods and to pray for a better\nfuture.\n \nThe only exit seems to be back south, to the Mage lab.\n~\n0 CDY 16\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 31905\nS\n#31916\nDraconian Cell~\nIt was a tight squeeze, but you have entered a small\nrough-hewn granite rock cell.

There is no windows or exits other\nthan the one controlled from this room, to prevent \nanyone entering without permission. There is source\nof water and magic can be used to create food for the\nones hiding. This is place you might need to spend \na long time when enemy troops take control of your\nhall. \n~\n0 CDK 0\nC warlock~\nD0\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 31900\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0

Travel'.","============\n  Astral travel can be the quickest way to move around \nour land.  However one must have a clue as to the creatures\nthat live in the destination area.  The following list\nhas been compiled by the sages of Warlock to aid the\ntraveller in this regard.  First some cautions for the\nnew Astral traveler.\n \n  1) Do not gate to an area you cannot handle!\n  2) The creature may be dead.  Thus your gate spell will fail.\n  3) A malicious renegade can summon your target creature\n     elsewhere to trap you.\n  4) The target creature may be cursed.  Your spell will fail.\n  5) The target creature may be charmed.  Your spell will fail.\n \n  Much of this information is also useful for the portal and\nnexus spells.  These spells are often under-utilized.

Some\nof our ancestors learned how to weave magical energies. \nUnfortunately, those who have been blessed with magic \nare also threatened by both renegades, and by those \nwho would seek to destroy those who are more powerful \nthan themselves.  To defend themselves against these \nrenegades, the magi have long ago developed an Art of War.\n{x\nAnazar of the Black Robes of Warlock passes along key\npoints in this art.","Know Your Enemy - Before you begin any pfight, always know who \nyou are fighting with.  Most races/remorts have a certain vulnerability \nwhich you can use against them in combat.  For example, you can use \nweapons with the \"flame\" noun to vuln yinns and if you are a mage/wizard, \nthe \"incinerate\" spell will also hurt them.  Also look at their class.  \nRealize that you will probably have a more difficult time casting a \nsleep spell on a berzerker than you would on a warrior for example.  \nThe mage who knows his or her opponent before battle will have a \nmuch easier time coming out of that battle alive.","Use Your Spells As An Advantage - First and foremost, you \nare a caster.  You don't rely on hits like a fighter or stealth \nlike a thief.  You rely on your magic.  Use this to your ability.  \nDestroy your opponent with spells, catch them off-guard with your \nmagic.  If you choose to rely only on your hits to kill an enemy, \nbeing a caster, you will have a much harder fight on your hands.","Know When to Flee - A good fighter always knows his limits.  \nKnow yours.  There are a variety of things you can do to know \nwhen to flee.  Wimpy can help you automatically flee when you \nare very hurt.  Also, being mages, you have a variety of ways \nto escape combat besides just fleeing.  If you are a cleric \nclass, the \"mirror image\" spell in the psionics group will \nenable you to leave the room you were previously fighting in, \nwhile your opponent fights a temporary mirror image he thinks \nis you.  If you are an elementalist, nodes are meant to make \nyour life much easier.  Use them to your advantage.  Choose \nwisely when you pick a location to make your node as once you \ndo pick one, you won't be able to change your mind.  For other \ncasters, besides just spamming flee, you can use the transportation \ngroup to assist you.  Both the teleport and gate spells can help \nyou with this.  However, if you want to use one of these spells \nIN combat, use gate.  If you flee and then use a spell, you can \nuse either gate or teleport.  Do not try to use teleport in combat \nas its chances of succeeding are low and you will most likely fail.  \nYou can also try to use the recall spell in or out of combat.  \nCertain magical items such as wearing a compass, or quaffing a \njar of blood, may also assist you in escaping a fight.  Your \nlast option is to use deity gifts.  If you are pledge Hermes \nand have enough sac points, you can pray transport (if you aren't \ncursed) and this will be similar to casting teleport.  A better \noption than casting 'word of recall' would be to pray recall.  \nIf you cast 'word of recall' then you have some spell lag, and \nyour opponent may be able to catch you because of this.  Pray \nrecall however has no lag.  Once you pray for it, you arrive \ninstantly at Hassan, and can then walk quickly to your hall or \nto a place of safety.","Use Your Class' Advantages - Every magic-using class has \nits own advantages.  For example, cleric classes can heal \nthemselves, wizards cast powerful maledictions, and elementalists \nhave a variety of interesting nature spells.  Learn how to use \nyour class effectively.  Learn its weaknesses and its strengths, \nas both of these will hurt and help you in combat.","Use Spells Which Are Special To Your Class - Every caster \nclass has certain spells which only he or she can use.  For \nexample, crusaders have hold person elementalists have earthbind, \nand wizards have sleep.  Both of these spells can be used to \ncompletely immobilize your opponent for a period of time.  This \ncan give you the chance to maladict them or to call for other \nmethods of aid to assist in killing them.  However, be warned \nbefore using these spells.  Each of these will have a certain \nspell lag time if you fail.  During this lag time, your opponent \nwill be made aware of the fact that you have tried to kill him or \nher, and will thus attack you.  If you are at low health, do not \ntry to cast one of these spells unless you are certain you will \nnot fail it.","For Necromancers - If you are a class with necromancy (every \ncaster class but elementalists) then ALWAYS use withstand death.  \nIf you are leveling, if you are out gathering funds, even if \nyou go into town to spell someone up, always have withstand \ndeath on.  This spell will enable you to \"cheat\" death.  Once \nyou have died, you will immediately return with a small percentage \nof your hp, giving you another chance to flee from your opponent.","Healing In Combat - Healing while fighting is always a good \nidea.  For cleric classes, the healing group is very useful.  \nHowever, in order to conserve mana, if you are outside of \ncombat (i.e. flee then gate to a safe spot to heal) use the \n'cure critical' spell on yourself.  This spell, although it \nheals less hit points, also helps you to conserve your mana.  \nIf you are in combat, use the heal spell for quick hit point \nregeneration.  Also, gain the curative class.  This will enable \nyou to heal basic maledictions - poison, plague, and blindness.  \nIf you are a mage class, things are more difficult for you.  \nIt might be wise to carry around potions of cure serious (available \nfor sale at most clan hall shops).  Certain staves, wands, other \npotions, and pills also have healing abilities which can grant \nyou some health regeneration in combat.","Maladict Your Enemy - As a caster, you most likely will not \nbe able to match a fighter when you compare your hit points \nand hits to his.  To even out combat, use maledictions.  For \nelementalists, you have a variety of powerful nature spells \nsuch as asphyxiate and irradiate which can make your opponent \nmuch weaker in combat.  For all other classes, the maledictions \ngroup will serve you well.  Poison and plague will slowly drain \naway an opponents health and mana, respectively, weaken will \nlower their strength attribute, blindess will take away their \nvision temporarily, curse will cause their deity to turn his \neyes from them, and energy drain, when it lands, helps you to \ndrain their mana and movement points.","Hunting - If you wish to hunt your opponent, take a few \nfactors into account.  Are they leveling? If so, what alignment \nare they?  What possible places could they be leveling in?  If \nthey are not leveling, use gate points to search around places \nwhere they could be gathering funds and also check town occasionally.  \nIf you're lucky, you may be able to catch them as they recall \nor return to their halls.","These tips are only a small portion of the true Art of War.  \nUse these to fight, but do not rely on them completely.  Every \nmage has his or her own way of combat.  With enough pkilling \nexperience, you will find yours.  Benefit from your mistakes, \nlearn from your errors, and remember, always defend the magic.\n{x\n  This work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However, this item does not exist in \nthis world in a form useful to us; instead, it has to be created.\n \nFirstly, a container suitable for the creation of this item is needed - the \nbinding kit.  This can be found on the Master Spell Binder in the High Tower of\nSorcery (gate master binder).  The first step towards creating a scroll is to \nstart with a blank one first; St. Bob's Map Shop has a large supply of blank \nscrolls at affordable prices.  In order for the scroll to have its binding \nproperties, the acquisition of a thread of binding silk from one of the \nnumerous spiders in this world which carry it is imperative.  Trying to track \ndown one of these can be laborious, so it is suggested to select the Queen \nSpider.  Finally, something is needed out of which the arcane symbols will be \nformed on the scroll.  A bottle of ink will not suffice as the magic held \nwithin the symbols will cause the ink to combust, destroying the scroll.  \nInstead, two diamonds need to be used.\n \nPlace the blank scroll, the thread of binding silk and the two diamonds into \nthe binding kit and head to the forge at the Midgaard Armourer. Type \"forge \nkit\" to set the magic in motion.  The two diamonds will shatter and the dust \nand the thread will merge into the blank scroll, forming the Scroll of Binding,\nretrievable from the binding kit.","The cost of researching adamantite skin and incinerate is not cheap; they need \nsix eggs and eight eggs respectively.  The ingredients needed aren't the eggs \nthough, but sapphires formed from the eggs.  The Midgaard Jeweller possesses a \ncrucible which he has on sale which is needed to form the sapphires.  Although \nthis item is relatively cheap compared to the price of research, it wouldn't \nhurt to ask around to see if someone has one that they aren't using.\n \nSapphires are made at the forge at the Midgaard Armourer.  Place the required \nnumber of eggs into the jeweller's crucible and type \"forge crucible\".  The \neggs are then fused together to form the different sapphires.  Adamantite skin \nrequires two reflective sapphires made from three eggs each, while incinerate \nuses two fire sapphires made from four eggs each.\n \nFor more information reguarding the creation of sapphires, refer to the \nNovice's Guide to Jewelcraft, on sale at the Midgaard Jeweller when in stock.","In order to research adamantite skin and incinerate, wizards need to be trained in this \nskill.  However, practicing research is fairly difficult and, considering the price of \nthese two spells, failure is costly.\nResearch can be practiced up to 95% and if you intend using it, it is advisable to get \nit this high.  If you don't wish to use all your practice sessions on research, ask if \nsomeone else in the clan can do it for you.  If you wish to do it yourself, take the \nfollowing into account:\n \nIntelligence at 20 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 21 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 22 increases research by 7% per prac.\nIntelligence at 23 increases research by 8% per prac.\nIntelligence at 24 increases research by 10% per prac.\nIntelligence at 25 increases research by 10% per prac.\nThis only applies when research is below 75%.  Any practice used after this only \nincreases it by 1%.  For this reason, you could attempt to save a practice session of \ntwo by reducing your intelligence to reach 74% to get the maximum out of your sessions.","Adamantite skin is the most powerful spell wizards can use to defend \nthemselves.  It is only available from level 50 at a cost of 150 mana and comes\nwith a considerable casting delay, but has an initial duration of 25 to 26 \nhours (casting level / 2 rounded down).  Each hit you deflect reduces the \nduration by 2 hours.\n \nTo create the scroll of adamantite skin, a scroll of binding, two reflective \nsapphires and a bar of adamantite are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for \ndetails on the scroll and sapphires.)  The bar of adamantite can be found north\nof the Master Enchanter in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The bar of adamantite and the sapphires \nwill begin fusing together while the binding forces are extended from the \nscroll.  When fused, the bar and sapphires will explode and, if the binding \nforces were aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy released will \nbe bound into the scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of \nadamantite skin.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.","Incinerate is the fire version of acid blast, and most useful for making crispy\nyinns.  It is only available from level 38 at a cost of 50 mana.\n \nTo create the scroll of incineration, a scroll of binding, two fire sapphires \nand a rune of fire are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for details on the \nscroll and sapphires.)  The rune of fire can be found on the Greater Fire Demon\nin the depths of hell.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The fire sapphires will burst into \nflames to be absorbed by the rune of fire, causing the rune to harden and \nshatter.  The dust will then merge with the binding forces from the scroll and,\nif aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy will be bound into the \nscroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of incineration.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.","Not all of the advanced spells have to be researched.  Steel skin and diamond \nskin can be found in Boinga, but these are nowhere near as powerful as \nadamanatite skin.\n \nSteel skin is available from level 35 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nmoderate casting delay, and has an initial duration of a mere 7 to 10 hours \n(casting level / 5 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on the steel \nclam, in Buccaneer Bay.\n \nDiamond skin is available from level 45 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nlengthy casting delay, and has an initial duration of 15 to 17 hours (casting \nlevel / 3 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on a diamond golem two \nrooms east and one room south of Ezmeralda in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nBoth these spells are copied in a magelab by holding the spell page and using \nthe \"copyspell\" command.  Each hit you deflect reduces the duration by 2 hours.","Rivalling acid blast and incinerate, two new spells can be found; sunburst and\nsonic blast.\n \nSunburst is available from level 44 at a cost of 65 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast, but does light damage which can blind \nyour victim.  The spell page is found on the s'lu master in Altirin.\n \nSonic blast is available from level 45 at a cost of 75 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast as well, but has a chance to stun your \nvictim for a round or two.  The spell page is found on the yinnish monk in \nAltirin.","Not all combat spells come in the form of something that can do damage \ndirectly.  Some come in maladictive form, as is the case with flameseek.\n \nFlameseek is available from level 40 at a cost of 75 mana, and imparts a fire \nvuln on your victim.  Its affects will stay with your victim for 2 to 3 hours. \nThe spell page is found on the elemental guardian at the entrance to the \nElemental Plane of Fire.\n \nUsed in conjunction with fireball or incinerate, flameseek may result in \nseveral charred remains.  Welding torches and flamewhips also\nare handy with this spell.  Use this spell on slept victims,\nor to initiate combat.","This work covers a subject that is continually changing.\nFuture editions will be produced to cover what is learned in \nthe future.

However one must have a clue as to the creatures\nthat live in the destination area.  The following list\nhas been compiled by the sages of Warlock to aid the\ntraveller in this regard.  First some cautions for the\nnew Astral traveler.\n \n  1) Do not gate to an area you cannot handle!\n  2) The creature may be dead.  Thus your gate spell will fail.\n  3) A malicious renegade can summon your target creature\n     elsewhere to trap you.\n  4) The target creature may be cursed.  Your spell will fail.\n  5) The target creature may be charmed.  Your spell will fail.\n \n  Much of this information is also useful for the portal and\nnexus spells.  These spells are often under-utilized.  You \nmay wish to reflect on their use in your practice of magick.\n~\nE\nsilver1~\nArea                          Gate Post\n============================  ======================\nAltirin Forest                None\nArachnos                      Young spider\nAspen Penal Colony            Link angel\nAstral/Githyanki              Githzerai\nAvarice Clan Hall             Herald\nBalance Clan Hall             None\nBanshee                       None\nBathe House                   Desk clerk\nBluetspur                     Geist, jiakan, illithid\nBuccaneer Bay                 ?\nCamelot                       Black knight\nCampgrounds                   Faerie\nCastle Camorra                Apparition\nCastle Delain                 Delain guard\nCastle Trinity                Young warrior\nChapel Catacombs              Etcher\nChurch of Matook              None\nCity of Atlantis              Fido fish\nCity of Thieves               Cockroach\nCrescent Beach                Crane\nCuthbert's Fief               Firbolg\n~\nE\nsilver2~\nDangerous Neighborhood        Gang\nDen of Thieves                Guardian thief\nDescent to Hell               Coins, nose, weeds, burning fool, \n                              female construction worker, jury\nDragon Tower                  Draconian fool\nDrow City                     Drow commoner\nDwarven Catacombs             Grand templar\nDwarven Day Care              Doll\nDwarven Kingdom               None\nDylan's Area                  Harpy\nElemental Canyon              Bandit\nElemental Planes              ?\nElven High Court              None\nElven Printing Co             Printer\nEmerald Forest                Porcupine\nEnchanted Lake                Heap\nForbidden City                Fanatic\n~\nE\nsilver3~\nGalaxy                        Cepheus\nGhoul Forest                  Sassy, hungry ghoul\nGladiator Arena               None\nGnome Village                 Gnome child\nGraveyard                     ?\nGreat Pyramid                 Tomb\nGypsy Camp                    Bruno\nHall of Clan Bane             None\nHall of Ennoble               ?\nHall of the Apocalypse        None\nHaon Dor                      Warg\nHaunted House                 Rocking horse\nHigh Tower of Sorcery         Ezmerelda\nHoly Grove                    Hierophant\nIn the Air                    Faerie dragon\nIvory Stronghold              Dove\nKeep of Mahn-Tor              Tyrgoth\nKender Village                Kender mayor\n~\nE\nsilver4~\nLegion Clan Hall              None\nLimbo                         ?\nLost Bog                      None\nLost Catacombs                ?\nLost Ways                     ?\nLycanthropia                  Pooh\nMachine Dreams                None\nMega-City One                 Futsie\nMiden'nir                     Dark horseman\nMidgaard                      Vagabond\nMob Factory                   Toxic slime\nMoonstone Inn                 None\nMoria                         ?\nMystgar's Domain              Tetraps\nNew Ofcol                     Diana       \nNew Thalos                    Vulture\nNirvana                       None\nNottingham                    Merry man           \nNova Veesa                    3.bandit\n~\nE\nsilver5~\nOfcol                         Jacklyn\nOld Hall of Clan Circle       Circle guardian\nOld Marsh                     None\nOld Thalos                    Lamia\nOlympus                       Pegasus\nOrcs' Lair                    Orc leader\nPakat                         Indian fido\nPlains of the North           Sorbus, Aruncus\nPlane of Time                 Egg timer, split second, bedtime\nRainforest                    Crocodile\nRedferne's Residence          Grand knight\nSands of Sorrow               Scorpion\nSea of Serenity               None\nSecret Tomb                   Jade\nSewer                         Herald, 7.wererat etc\nShadowvale                    None\nShire                         Thain\nSmurf Village                 Smurfette\nSri Raji                      Indian fido\nStormy Mountain               Satyr\nSwimming Hole                 Beaver?\n~\nE\nsilver6~\nTemple o' Evil                Clan warrior\nTenochtitlan                  Aztec guard\nThalos                        Beholder\nTheatre of Boinga             Hamlet\nTroll Den                     None\nUnderSmurf                    None\nValley of the Elves           Antelope\nVillage Fair                  Baloo\nWarlock Clan Hall             Circle guardian, desk clerk\nWhore House                   (see city of thieves)\nWooster                       Security\nWyvern River                  Will-o-wisp\nWyvern's Tower                Black pudding, Elite gargoyle\nZealot Clan Hall              Sorbus, Aruncus\n \n============================================================\n~\nE\nsilverend~\nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

Some\nof our ancestors learned how to weave magical energies. \nUnfortunately, those who have been blessed with magic \nare also threatened by both renegades, and by those \nwho would seek to destroy those who are more powerful \nthan themselves.  To defend themselves against these \nrenegades, the magi have long ago developed an Art of War.\n{x\nAnazar of the Black Robes of Warlock passes along key\npoints in this art.\n~\nE\nwar1~\nKnow Your Enemy - Before you begin any pfight, always know who \nyou are fighting with.  Most races/remorts have a certain vulnerability \nwhich you can use against them in combat.  For example, you can use \nweapons with the \"flame\" noun to vuln yinns and if you are a mage/wizard, \nthe \"incinerate\" spell will also hurt them.  Also look at their class.  \nRealize that you will probably have a more difficult time casting a \nsleep spell on a berzerker than you would on a warrior for example.  \nThe mage who knows his or her opponent before battle will have a \nmuch easier time coming out of that battle alive.\n \n~\nE\nwar2~\nUse Your Spells As An Advantage - First and foremost, you \nare a caster.  You don't rely on hits like a fighter or stealth \nlike a thief.  You rely on your magic.  Use this to your ability.  \nDestroy your opponent with spells, catch them off-guard with your \nmagic.  If you choose to rely only on your hits to kill an enemy, \nbeing a caster, you will have a much harder fight on your hands.\n~\nE\nwar3~\nKnow When to Flee - A good fighter always knows his limits.  \nKnow yours.  There are a variety of things you can do to know \nwhen to flee.  Wimpy can help you automatically flee when you \nare very hurt.  Also, being mages, you have a variety of ways \nto escape combat besides just fleeing.  If you are a cleric \nclass, the \"mirror image\" spell in the psionics group will \nenable you to leave the room you were previously fighting in, \nwhile your opponent fights a temporary mirror image he thinks \nis you.  If you are an elementalist, nodes are meant to make \nyour life much easier.  Use them to your advantage.  Choose \nwisely when you pick a location to make your node as once you \ndo pick one, you won't be able to change your mind.  For other \ncasters, besides just spamming flee, you can use the transportation \ngroup to assist you.  Both the teleport and gate spells can help \nyou with this.  However, if you want to use one of these spells \nIN combat, use gate.  If you flee and then use a spell, you can \nuse either gate or teleport.  Do not try to use teleport in combat \nas its chances of succeeding are low and you will most likely fail.  \nYou can also try to use the recall spell in or out of combat.  \nCertain magical items such as wearing a compass, or quaffing a \njar of blood, may also assist you in escaping a fight.  Your \nlast option is to use deity gifts.  If you are pledge Hermes \nand have enough sac points, you can pray transport (if you aren't \ncursed) and this will be similar to casting teleport.  A better \noption than casting 'word of recall' would be to pray recall.  \nIf you cast 'word of recall' then you have some spell lag, and \nyour opponent may be able to catch you because of this.  Pray \nrecall however has no lag.  Once you pray for it, you arrive \ninstantly at Hassan, and can then walk quickly to your hall or \nto a place of safety.\n~\nE\nwar4~\nUse Your Class' Advantages - Every magic-using class has \nits own advantages.  For example, cleric classes can heal \nthemselves, wizards cast powerful maledictions, and elementalists \nhave a variety of interesting nature spells.  Learn how to use \nyour class effectively.  Learn its weaknesses and its strengths, \nas both of these will hurt and help you in combat.\n~\nE\nwar5~\nUse Spells Which Are Special To Your Class - Every caster \nclass has certain spells which only he or she can use.  For \nexample, crusaders have hold person elementalists have earthbind, \nand wizards have sleep.  Both of these spells can be used to \ncompletely immobilize your opponent for a period of time.  This \ncan give you the chance to maladict them or to call for other \nmethods of aid to assist in killing them.  However, be warned \nbefore using these spells.  Each of these will have a certain \nspell lag time if you fail.  During this lag time, your opponent \nwill be made aware of the fact that you have tried to kill him or \nher, and will thus attack you.  If you are at low health, do not \ntry to cast one of these spells unless you are certain you will \nnot fail it.\n~\nE\nwar6~\nFor Necromancers - If you are a class with necromancy (every \ncaster class but elementalists) then ALWAYS use withstand death.  \nIf you are leveling, if you are out gathering funds, even if \nyou go into town to spell someone up, always have withstand \ndeath on.  This spell will enable you to \"cheat\" death.  Once \nyou have died, you will immediately return with a small percentage \nof your hp, giving you another chance to flee from your opponent.\n~\nE\nwar7~\nHealing In Combat - Healing while fighting is always a good \nidea.  For cleric classes, the healing group is very useful.  \nHowever, in order to conserve mana, if you are outside of \ncombat (i.e. flee then gate to a safe spot to heal) use the \n'cure critical' spell on yourself.  This spell, although it \nheals less hit points, also helps you to conserve your mana.  \nIf you are in combat, use the heal spell for quick hit point \nregeneration.  Also, gain the curative class.  This will enable \nyou to heal basic maledictions - poison, plague, and blindness.  \nIf you are a mage class, things are more difficult for you.  \nIt might be wise to carry around potions of cure serious (available \nfor sale at most clan hall shops).  Certain staves, wands, other \npotions, and pills also have healing abilities which can grant \nyou some health regeneration in combat.\n~\nE\nwar8~\nMaladict Your Enemy - As a caster, you most likely will not \nbe able to match a fighter when you compare your hit points \nand hits to his.  To even out combat, use maledictions.  For \nelementalists, you have a variety of powerful nature spells \nsuch as asphyxiate and irradiate which can make your opponent \nmuch weaker in combat.  For all other classes, the maledictions \ngroup will serve you well.  Poison and plague will slowly drain \naway an opponents health and mana, respectively, weaken will \nlower their strength attribute, blindess will take away their \nvision temporarily, curse will cause their deity to turn his \neyes from them, and energy drain, when it lands, helps you to \ndrain their mana and movement points.\n~\nE\nwar9~\nHunting - If you wish to hunt your opponent, take a few \nfactors into account.  Are they leveling? If so, what alignment \nare they?  What possible places could they be leveling in?  If \nthey are not leveling, use gate points to search around places \nwhere they could be gathering funds and also check town occasionally.  \nIf you're lucky, you may be able to catch them as they recall \nor return to their halls.\n~\nE\nwarend~\nThese tips are only a small portion of the true Art of War.  \nUse these to fight, but do not rely on them completely.  Every \nmage has his or her own way of combat.  With enough pkilling \nexperience, you will find yours.  Benefit from your mistakes, \nlearn from your errors, and remember, always defend the magic.\n{x\n  This work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However, this item does not exist in \nthis world in a form useful to us; instead, it has to be created.\n \nFirstly, a container suitable for the creation of this item is needed - the \nbinding kit.  This can be found on the Master Spell Binder in the High Tower of\nSorcery (gate master binder).  The first step towards creating a scroll is to \nstart with a blank one first; St. Bob's Map Shop has a large supply of blank \nscrolls at affordable prices.  In order for the scroll to have its binding \nproperties, the acquisition of a thread of binding silk from one of the \nnumerous spiders in this world which carry it is imperative.  Trying to track \ndown one of these can be laborious, so it is suggested to select the Queen \nSpider.  Finally, something is needed out of which the arcane symbols will be \nformed on the scroll.  A bottle of ink will not suffice as the magic held \nwithin the symbols will cause the ink to combust, destroying the scroll.  \nInstead, two diamonds need to be used.\n \nPlace the blank scroll, the thread of binding silk and the two diamonds into \nthe binding kit and head to the forge at the Midgaard Armourer. Type \"forge \nkit\" to set the magic in motion.  The two diamonds will shatter and the dust \nand the thread will merge into the blank scroll, forming the Scroll of Binding,\nretrievable from the binding kit.\n~\nE\nwiz2~\nThe cost of researching adamantite skin and incinerate is not cheap; they need \nsix eggs and eight eggs respectively.  The ingredients needed aren't the eggs \nthough, but sapphires formed from the eggs.  The Midgaard Jeweller possesses a \ncrucible which he has on sale which is needed to form the sapphires.  Although \nthis item is relatively cheap compared to the price of research, it wouldn't \nhurt to ask around to see if someone has one that they aren't using.\n \nSapphires are made at the forge at the Midgaard Armourer.  Place the required \nnumber of eggs into the jeweller's crucible and type \"forge crucible\".  The \neggs are then fused together to form the different sapphires.  Adamantite skin \nrequires two reflective sapphires made from three eggs each, while incinerate \nuses two fire sapphires made from four eggs each.\n \nFor more information reguarding the creation of sapphires, refer to the \nNovice's Guide to Jewelcraft, on sale at the Midgaard Jeweller when in stock.\n~\nE\nwiz3~\nIn order to research adamantite skin and incinerate, wizards need to be trained in this \nskill.  However, practicing research is fairly difficult and, considering the price of \nthese two spells, failure is costly.\nResearch can be practiced up to 95% and if you intend using it, it is advisable to get \nit this high.  If you don't wish to use all your practice sessions on research, ask if \nsomeone else in the clan can do it for you.  If you wish to do it yourself, take the \nfollowing into account:\n \nIntelligence at 20 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 21 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 22 increases research by 7% per prac.\nIntelligence at 23 increases research by 8% per prac.\nIntelligence at 24 increases research by 10% per prac.\nIntelligence at 25 increases research by 10% per prac.\nThis only applies when research is below 75%.  Any practice used after this only \nincreases it by 1%.  For this reason, you could attempt to save a practice session of \ntwo by reducing your intelligence to reach 74% to get the maximum out of your sessions.\n~\nE\nwiz4~\nAdamantite skin is the most powerful spell wizards can use to defend \nthemselves.  It is only available from level 50 at a cost of 150 mana and comes\nwith a considerable casting delay, but has an initial duration of 25 to 26 \nhours (casting level / 2 rounded down).  Each hit you deflect reduces the \nduration by 2 hours.\n \nTo create the scroll of adamantite skin, a scroll of binding, two reflective \nsapphires and a bar of adamantite are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for \ndetails on the scroll and sapphires.)  The bar of adamantite can be found north\nof the Master Enchanter in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The bar of adamantite and the sapphires \nwill begin fusing together while the binding forces are extended from the \nscroll.  When fused, the bar and sapphires will explode and, if the binding \nforces were aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy released will \nbe bound into the scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of \nadamantite skin.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz5~\nIncinerate is the fire version of acid blast, and most useful for making crispy\nyinns.  It is only available from level 38 at a cost of 50 mana.\n \nTo create the scroll of incineration, a scroll of binding, two fire sapphires \nand a rune of fire are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for details on the \nscroll and sapphires.)  The rune of fire can be found on the Greater Fire Demon\nin the depths of hell.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The fire sapphires will burst into \nflames to be absorbed by the rune of fire, causing the rune to harden and \nshatter.  The dust will then merge with the binding forces from the scroll and,\nif aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy will be bound into the \nscroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of incineration.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz6~\nNot all of the advanced spells have to be researched.  Steel skin and diamond \nskin can be found in Boinga, but these are nowhere near as powerful as \nadamanatite skin.\n \nSteel skin is available from level 35 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nmoderate casting delay, and has an initial duration of a mere 7 to 10 hours \n(casting level / 5 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on the steel \nclam, in Buccaneer Bay.\n \nDiamond skin is available from level 45 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nlengthy casting delay, and has an initial duration of 15 to 17 hours (casting \nlevel / 3 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on a diamond golem two \nrooms east and one room south of Ezmeralda in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nBoth these spells are copied in a magelab by holding the spell page and using \nthe \"copyspell\" command.  Each hit you deflect reduces the duration by 2 hours.\n~\nE\nwiz7~\nRivalling acid blast and incinerate, two new spells can be found; sunburst and\nsonic blast.\n \nSunburst is available from level 44 at a cost of 65 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast, but does light damage which can blind \nyour victim.  The spell page is found on the s'lu master in Altirin.\n \nSonic blast is available from level 45 at a cost of 75 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast as well, but has a chance to stun your \nvictim for a round or two.  The spell page is found on the yinnish monk in \nAltirin.\n~\nE\nwiz8~\nNot all combat spells come in the form of something that can do damage \ndirectly.  Some come in maladictive form, as is the case with flameseek.\n \nFlameseek is available from level 40 at a cost of 75 mana, and imparts a fire \nvuln on your victim.  Its affects will stay with your victim for 2 to 3 hours. \nThe spell page is found on the elemental guardian at the entrance to the \nElemental Plane of Fire.\n \nUsed in conjunction with fireball or incinerate, flameseek may result in \nseveral charred remains.  Welding torches and flamewhips also\nare handy with this spell.  Use this spell on slept victims,\nor to initiate combat.\n~\nE\nwizend~\nThis work covers a subject that is continually changing.\nFuture editions will be produced to cover what is learned in \nthe future.  Perhaps *your* work will be included.\nBenefit from your mistakes, learn from your errors, and \nremember, always defend the magic.\n \nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However one must have a clue as to the creatures\nthat live in the destination area.  The following list\nhas been compiled by the sages of Warlock to aid the\ntraveller in this regard.  First some cautions for the\nnew Astral traveler.\n \n  1) Do not gate to an area you cannot handle!\n  2) The creature may be dead.  Thus your gate spell will fail.\n  3) A malicious renegade can summon your target creature\n     elsewhere to trap you.\n  4) The target creature may be cursed.  Your spell will fail.\n  5) The target creature may be charmed.  Your spell will fail.\n \n  Much of this information is also useful for the portal and\nnexus spells.  These spells are often under-utilized.  You \nmay wish to reflect on their use in your practice of magick.\n~\nE\nsilver1~\nArea                          Gate Post\n============================  ======================\nAltirin Forest                None\nArachnos                      Young spider\nAspen Penal Colony            Link angel\nAstral/Githyanki              Githzerai\nAvarice Clan Hall             Herald\nBalance Clan Hall             None\nBanshee                       None\nBathe House                   Desk clerk\nBluetspur                     Geist, jiakan, illithid\nBuccaneer Bay                 ?\nCamelot                       Black knight\nCampgrounds                   Faerie\nCastle Camorra                Apparition\nCastle Delain                 Delain guard\nCastle Trinity                Young warrior\nChapel Catacombs              Etcher\nChurch of Matook              None\nCity of Atlantis              Fido fish\nCity of Thieves               Cockroach\nCrescent Beach                Crane\nCuthbert's Fief               Firbolg\n~\nE\nsilver2~\nDangerous Neighborhood        Gang\nDen of Thieves                Guardian thief\nDescent to Hell               Coins, nose, weeds, burning fool, \n                              female construction worker, jury\nDragon Tower                  Draconian fool\nDrow City                     Drow commoner\nDwarven Catacombs             Grand templar\nDwarven Day Care              Doll\nDwarven Kingdom               None\nDylan's Area                  Harpy\nElemental Canyon              Bandit\nElemental Planes              ?\nElven High Court              None\nElven Printing Co             Printer\nEmerald Forest                Porcupine\nEnchanted Lake                Heap\nForbidden City                Fanatic\n~\nE\nsilver3~\nGalaxy                        Cepheus\nGhoul Forest                  Sassy, hungry ghoul\nGladiator Arena               None\nGnome Village                 Gnome child\nGraveyard                     ?\nGreat Pyramid                 Tomb\nGypsy Camp                    Bruno\nHall of Clan Bane             None\nHall of Ennoble               ?\nHall of the Apocalypse        None\nHaon Dor                      Warg\nHaunted House                 Rocking horse\nHigh Tower of Sorcery         Ezmerelda\nHoly Grove                    Hierophant\nIn the Air                    Faerie dragon\nIvory Stronghold              Dove\nKeep of Mahn-Tor              Tyrgoth\nKender Village                Kender mayor\n~\nE\nsilver4~\nLegion Clan Hall              None\nLimbo                         ?\nLost Bog                      None\nLost Catacombs                ?\nLost Ways                     ?\nLycanthropia                  Pooh\nMachine Dreams                None\nMega-City One                 Futsie\nMiden'nir                     Dark horseman\nMidgaard                      Vagabond\nMob Factory                   Toxic slime\nMoonstone Inn                 None\nMoria                         ?\nMystgar's Domain              Tetraps\nNew Ofcol                     Diana       \nNew Thalos                    Vulture\nNirvana                       None\nNottingham                    Merry man           \nNova Veesa                    3.bandit\n~\nE\nsilver5~\nOfcol                         Jacklyn\nOld Hall of Clan Circle       Circle guardian\nOld Marsh                     None\nOld Thalos                    Lamia\nOlympus                       Pegasus\nOrcs' Lair                    Orc leader\nPakat                         Indian fido\nPlains of the North           Sorbus, Aruncus\nPlane of Time                 Egg timer, split second, bedtime\nRainforest                    Crocodile\nRedferne's Residence          Grand knight\nSands of Sorrow               Scorpion\nSea of Serenity               None\nSecret Tomb                   Jade\nSewer                         Herald, 7.wererat etc\nShadowvale                    None\nShire                         Thain\nSmurf Village                 Smurfette\nSri Raji                      Indian fido\nStormy Mountain               Satyr\nSwimming Hole                 Beaver?\n~\nE\nsilver6~\nTemple o' Evil                Clan warrior\nTenochtitlan                  Aztec guard\nThalos                        Beholder\nTheatre of Boinga             Hamlet\nTroll Den                     None\nUnderSmurf                    None\nValley of the Elves           Antelope\nVillage Fair                  Baloo\nWarlock Clan Hall             Circle guardian, desk clerk\nWhore House                   (see city of thieves)\nWooster                       Security\nWyvern River                  Will-o-wisp\nWyvern's Tower                Black pudding, Elite gargoyle\nZealot Clan Hall              Sorbus, Aruncus\n \n============================================================\n~\nE\nsilverend~\nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

Some\nof our ancestors learned how to weave magical energies. \nUnfortunately, those who have been blessed with magic \nare also threatened by both renegades, and by those \nwho would seek to destroy those who are more powerful \nthan themselves.  To defend themselves against these \nrenegades, the magi have long ago developed an Art of War.\n{x\nAnazar of the Black Robes of Warlock passes along key\npoints in this art.\n~\nE\nwar1~\nKnow Your Enemy - Before you begin any pfight, always know who \nyou are fighting with.  Most races/remorts have a certain vulnerability \nwhich you can use against them in combat.  For example, you can use \nweapons with the \"flame\" noun to vuln yinns and if you are a mage/wizard, \nthe \"incinerate\" spell will also hurt them.  Also look at their class.  \nRealize that you will probably have a more difficult time casting a \nsleep spell on a berzerker than you would on a warrior for example.  \nThe mage who knows his or her opponent before battle will have a \nmuch easier time coming out of that battle alive.\n \n~\nE\nwar2~\nUse Your Spells As An Advantage - First and foremost, you \nare a caster.  You don't rely on hits like a fighter or stealth \nlike a thief.  You rely on your magic.  Use this to your ability.  \nDestroy your opponent with spells, catch them off-guard with your \nmagic.  If you choose to rely only on your hits to kill an enemy, \nbeing a caster, you will have a much harder fight on your hands.\n~\nE\nwar3~\nKnow When to Flee - A good fighter always knows his limits.  \nKnow yours.  There are a variety of things you can do to know \nwhen to flee.  Wimpy can help you automatically flee when you \nare very hurt.  Also, being mages, you have a variety of ways \nto escape combat besides just fleeing.  If you are a cleric \nclass, the \"mirror image\" spell in the psionics group will \nenable you to leave the room you were previously fighting in, \nwhile your opponent fights a temporary mirror image he thinks \nis you.  If you are an elementalist, nodes are meant to make \nyour life much easier.  Use them to your advantage.  Choose \nwisely when you pick a location to make your node as once you \ndo pick one, you won't be able to change your mind.  For other \ncasters, besides just spamming flee, you can use the transportation \ngroup to assist you.  Both the teleport and gate spells can help \nyou with this.  However, if you want to use one of these spells \nIN combat, use gate.  If you flee and then use a spell, you can \nuse either gate or teleport.  Do not try to use teleport in combat \nas its chances of succeeding are low and you will most likely fail.  \nYou can also try to use the recall spell in or out of combat.  \nCertain magical items such as wearing a compass, or quaffing a \njar of blood, may also assist you in escaping a fight.  Your \nlast option is to use deity gifts.  If you are pledge Hermes \nand have enough sac points, you can pray transport (if you aren't \ncursed) and this will be similar to casting teleport.  A better \noption than casting 'word of recall' would be to pray recall.  \nIf you cast 'word of recall' then you have some spell lag, and \nyour opponent may be able to catch you because of this.  Pray \nrecall however has no lag.  Once you pray for it, you arrive \ninstantly at Hassan, and can then walk quickly to your hall or \nto a place of safety.\n~\nE\nwar4~\nUse Your Class' Advantages - Every magic-using class has \nits own advantages.  For example, cleric classes can heal \nthemselves, wizards cast powerful maledictions, and elementalists \nhave a variety of interesting nature spells.  Learn how to use \nyour class effectively.  Learn its weaknesses and its strengths, \nas both of these will hurt and help you in combat.\n~\nE\nwar5~\nUse Spells Which Are Special To Your Class - Every caster \nclass has certain spells which only he or she can use.  For \nexample, crusaders have hold person elementalists have earthbind, \nand wizards have sleep.  Both of these spells can be used to \ncompletely immobilize your opponent for a period of time.  This \ncan give you the chance to maladict them or to call for other \nmethods of aid to assist in killing them.  However, be warned \nbefore using these spells.  Each of these will have a certain \nspell lag time if you fail.  During this lag time, your opponent \nwill be made aware of the fact that you have tried to kill him or \nher, and will thus attack you.  If you are at low health, do not \ntry to cast one of these spells unless you are certain you will \nnot fail it.\n~\nE\nwar6~\nFor Necromancers - If you are a class with necromancy (every \ncaster class but elementalists) then ALWAYS use withstand death.  \nIf you are leveling, if you are out gathering funds, even if \nyou go into town to spell someone up, always have withstand \ndeath on.  This spell will enable you to \"cheat\" death.  Once \nyou have died, you will immediately return with a small percentage \nof your hp, giving you another chance to flee from your opponent.\n~\nE\nwar7~\nHealing In Combat - Healing while fighting is always a good \nidea.  For cleric classes, the healing group is very useful.  \nHowever, in order to conserve mana, if you are outside of \ncombat (i.e. flee then gate to a safe spot to heal) use the \n'cure critical' spell on yourself.  This spell, although it \nheals less hit points, also helps you to conserve your mana.  \nIf you are in combat, use the heal spell for quick hit point \nregeneration.  Also, gain the curative class.  This will enable \nyou to heal basic maledictions - poison, plague, and blindness.  \nIf you are a mage class, things are more difficult for you.  \nIt might be wise to carry around potions of cure serious (available \nfor sale at most clan hall shops).  Certain staves, wands, other \npotions, and pills also have healing abilities which can grant \nyou some health regeneration in combat.\n~\nE\nwar8~\nMaladict Your Enemy - As a caster, you most likely will not \nbe able to match a fighter when you compare your hit points \nand hits to his.  To even out combat, use maledictions.  For \nelementalists, you have a variety of powerful nature spells \nsuch as asphyxiate and irradiate which can make your opponent \nmuch weaker in combat.  For all other classes, the maledictions \ngroup will serve you well.  Poison and plague will slowly drain \naway an opponents health and mana, respectively, weaken will \nlower their strength attribute, blindess will take away their \nvision temporarily, curse will cause their deity to turn his \neyes from them, and energy drain, when it lands, helps you to \ndrain their mana and movement points.\n~\nE\nwar9~\nHunting - If you wish to hunt your opponent, take a few \nfactors into account.  Are they leveling? If so, what alignment \nare they?  What possible places could they be leveling in?  If \nthey are not leveling, use gate points to search around places \nwhere they could be gathering funds and also check town occasionally.  \nIf you're lucky, you may be able to catch them as they recall \nor return to their halls.\n~\nE\nwarend~\nThese tips are only a small portion of the true Art of War.  \nUse these to fight, but do not rely on them completely.  Every \nmage has his or her own way of combat.  With enough pkilling \nexperience, you will find yours.  Benefit from your mistakes, \nlearn from your errors, and remember, always defend the magic.\n{x\n  This work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However, this item does not exist in \nthis world in a form useful to us; instead, it has to be created.\n \nFirstly, a container suitable for the creation of this item is needed - the \nbinding kit.  This can be found on the Master Spell Binder in the High Tower of\nSorcery (gate master binder).  The first step towards creating a scroll is to \nstart with a blank one first; St. Bob's Map Shop has a large supply of blank \nscrolls at affordable prices.  In order for the scroll to have its binding \nproperties, the acquisition of a thread of binding silk from one of the \nnumerous spiders in this world which carry it is imperative.  Trying to track \ndown one of these can be laborious, so it is suggested to select the Queen \nSpider.  Finally, something is needed out of which the arcane symbols will be \nformed on the scroll.  A bottle of ink will not suffice as the magic held \nwithin the symbols will cause the ink to combust, destroying the scroll.  \nInstead, two diamonds need to be used.\n \nPlace the blank scroll, the thread of binding silk and the two diamonds into \nthe binding kit and head to the forge at the Midgaard Armourer. Type \"forge \nkit\" to set the magic in motion.  The two diamonds will shatter and the dust \nand the thread will merge into the blank scroll, forming the Scroll of Binding,\nretrievable from the binding kit.\n~\nE\nwiz2~\nThe cost of researching adamantite skin and incinerate is not cheap; they need \nsix eggs and eight eggs respectively.  The ingredients needed aren't the eggs \nthough, but sapphires formed from the eggs.  The Midgaard Jeweller possesses a \ncrucible which he has on sale which is needed to form the sapphires.  Although \nthis item is relatively cheap compared to the price of research, it wouldn't \nhurt to ask around to see if someone has one that they aren't using.\n \nSapphires are made at the forge at the Midgaard Armourer.  Place the required \nnumber of eggs into the jeweller's crucible and type \"forge crucible\".  The \neggs are then fused together to form the different sapphires.  Adamantite skin \nrequires two reflective sapphires made from three eggs each, while incinerate \nuses two fire sapphires made from four eggs each.\n \nFor more information reguarding the creation of sapphires, refer to the \nNovice's Guide to Jewelcraft, on sale at the Midgaard Jeweller when in stock.\n~\nE\nwiz3~\nIn order to research adamantite skin and incinerate, wizards need to be trained in this \nskill.  However, practicing research is fairly difficult and, considering the price of \nthese two spells, failure is costly.\nResearch can be practiced up to 95% and if you intend using it, it is advisable to get \nit this high.  If you don't wish to use all your practice sessions on research, ask if \nsomeone else in the clan can do it for you.  If you wish to do it yourself, take the \nfollowing into account:\n \nIntelligence at 20 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 21 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 22 increases research by 7% per prac.\nIntelligence at 23 increases research by 8% per prac.\nIntelligence at 24 increases research by 10% per prac.\nIntelligence at 25 increases research by 10% per prac.\nThis only applies when research is below 75%.  Any practice used after this only \nincreases it by 1%.  For this reason, you could attempt to save a practice session of \ntwo by reducing your intelligence to reach 74% to get the maximum out of your sessions.\n~\nE\nwiz4~\nAdamantite skin is the most powerful spell wizards can use to defend \nthemselves.  It is only available from level 50 at a cost of 150 mana and comes\nwith a considerable casting delay, but has an initial duration of 25 to 26 \nhours (casting level / 2 rounded down).  Each hit you deflect reduces the \nduration by 2 hours.\n \nTo create the scroll of adamantite skin, a scroll of binding, two reflective \nsapphires and a bar of adamantite are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for \ndetails on the scroll and sapphires.)  The bar of adamantite can be found north\nof the Master Enchanter in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The bar of adamantite and the sapphires \nwill begin fusing together while the binding forces are extended from the \nscroll.  When fused, the bar and sapphires will explode and, if the binding \nforces were aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy released will \nbe bound into the scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of \nadamantite skin.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz5~\nIncinerate is the fire version of acid blast, and most useful for making crispy\nyinns.  It is only available from level 38 at a cost of 50 mana.\n \nTo create the scroll of incineration, a scroll of binding, two fire sapphires \nand a rune of fire are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for details on the \nscroll and sapphires.)  The rune of fire can be found on the Greater Fire Demon\nin the depths of hell.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The fire sapphires will burst into \nflames to be absorbed by the rune of fire, causing the rune to harden and \nshatter.  The dust will then merge with the binding forces from the scroll and,\nif aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy will be bound into the \nscroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of incineration.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz6~\nNot all of the advanced spells have to be researched.  Steel skin and diamond \nskin can be found in Boinga, but these are nowhere near as powerful as \nadamanatite skin.\n \nSteel skin is available from level 35 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nmoderate casting delay, and has an initial duration of a mere 7 to 10 hours \n(casting level / 5 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on the steel \nclam, in Buccaneer Bay.\n \nDiamond skin is available from level 45 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nlengthy casting delay, and has an initial duration of 15 to 17 hours (casting \nlevel / 3 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on a diamond golem two \nrooms east and one room south of Ezmeralda in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nBoth these spells are copied in a magelab by holding the spell page and using \nthe \"copyspell\" command.  Each hit you deflect reduces the duration by 2 hours.\n~\nE\nwiz7~\nRivalling acid blast and incinerate, two new spells can be found; sunburst and\nsonic blast.\n \nSunburst is available from level 44 at a cost of 65 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast, but does light damage which can blind \nyour victim.  The spell page is found on the s'lu master in Altirin.\n \nSonic blast is available from level 45 at a cost of 75 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast as well, but has a chance to stun your \nvictim for a round or two.  The spell page is found on the yinnish monk in \nAltirin.\n~\nE\nwiz8~\nNot all combat spells come in the form of something that can do damage \ndirectly.  Some come in maladictive form, as is the case with flameseek.\n \nFlameseek is available from level 40 at a cost of 75 mana, and imparts a fire \nvuln on your victim.  Its affects will stay with your victim for 2 to 3 hours. \nThe spell page is found on the elemental guardian at the entrance to the \nElemental Plane of Fire.\n \nUsed in conjunction with fireball or incinerate, flameseek may result in \nseveral charred remains.  Welding torches and flamewhips also\nare handy with this spell.  Use this spell on slept victims,\nor to initiate combat.\n~\nE\nwizend~\nThis work covers a subject that is continually changing.\nFuture editions will be produced to cover what is learned in \nthe future.  Perhaps *your* work will be included.\nBenefit from your mistakes, learn from your errors, and \nremember, always defend the magic.\n \nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However one must have a clue as to the creatures\nthat live in the destination area.  The following list\nhas been compiled by the sages of Warlock to aid the\ntraveller in this regard.  First some cautions for the\nnew Astral traveler.\n \n  1) Do not gate to an area you cannot handle!\n  2) The creature may be dead.  Thus your gate spell will fail.\n  3) A malicious renegade can summon your target creature\n     elsewhere to trap you.\n  4) The target creature may be cursed.

Some\nof our ancestors learned how to weave magical energies. \nUnfortunately, those who have been blessed with magic \nare also threatened by both renegades, and by those \nwho would seek to destroy those who are more powerful \nthan themselves.  To defend themselves against these \nrenegades, the magi have long ago developed an Art of War.\n{x\nAnazar of the Black Robes of Warlock passes along key\npoints in this art.\n~\nE\nwar1~\nKnow Your Enemy - Before you begin any pfight, always know who \nyou are fighting with.  Most races/remorts have a certain vulnerability \nwhich you can use against them in combat.  For example, you can use \nweapons with the \"flame\" noun to vuln yinns and if you are a mage/wizard, \nthe \"incinerate\" spell will also hurt them.  Also look at their class.  \nRealize that you will probably have a more difficult time casting a \nsleep spell on a berzerker than you would on a warrior for example.  \nThe mage who knows his or her opponent before battle will have a \nmuch easier time coming out of that battle alive.\n \n~\nE\nwar2~\nUse Your Spells As An Advantage - First and foremost, you \nare a caster.  You don't rely on hits like a fighter or stealth \nlike a thief.  You rely on your magic.  Use this to your ability.  \nDestroy your opponent with spells, catch them off-guard with your \nmagic.  If you choose to rely only on your hits to kill an enemy, \nbeing a caster, you will have a much harder fight on your hands.\n~\nE\nwar3~\nKnow When to Flee - A good fighter always knows his limits.  \nKnow yours.  There are a variety of things you can do to know \nwhen to flee.  Wimpy can help you automatically flee when you \nare very hurt.  Also, being mages, you have a variety of ways \nto escape combat besides just fleeing.  If you are a cleric \nclass, the \"mirror image\" spell in the psionics group will \nenable you to leave the room you were previously fighting in, \nwhile your opponent fights a temporary mirror image he thinks \nis you.  If you are an elementalist, nodes are meant to make \nyour life much easier.  Use them to your advantage.  Choose \nwisely when you pick a location to make your node as once you \ndo pick one, you won't be able to change your mind.  For other \ncasters, besides just spamming flee, you can use the transportation \ngroup to assist you.  Both the teleport and gate spells can help \nyou with this.  However, if you want to use one of these spells \nIN combat, use gate.  If you flee and then use a spell, you can \nuse either gate or teleport.  Do not try to use teleport in combat \nas its chances of succeeding are low and you will most likely fail.  \nYou can also try to use the recall spell in or out of combat.  \nCertain magical items such as wearing a compass, or quaffing a \njar of blood, may also assist you in escaping a fight.  Your \nlast option is to use deity gifts.  If you are pledge Hermes \nand have enough sac points, you can pray transport (if you aren't \ncursed) and this will be similar to casting teleport.  A better \noption than casting 'word of recall' would be to pray recall.  \nIf you cast 'word of recall' then you have some spell lag, and \nyour opponent may be able to catch you because of this.  Pray \nrecall however has no lag.  Once you pray for it, you arrive \ninstantly at Hassan, and can then walk quickly to your hall or \nto a place of safety.\n~\nE\nwar4~\nUse Your Class' Advantages - Every magic-using class has \nits own advantages.  For example, cleric classes can heal \nthemselves, wizards cast powerful maledictions, and elementalists \nhave a variety of interesting nature spells.  Learn how to use \nyour class effectively.  Learn its weaknesses and its strengths, \nas both of these will hurt and help you in combat.\n~\nE\nwar5~\nUse Spells Which Are Special To Your Class - Every caster \nclass has certain spells which only he or she can use.  For \nexample, crusaders have hold person elementalists have earthbind, \nand wizards have sleep.  Both of these spells can be used to \ncompletely immobilize your opponent for a period of time.  This \ncan give you the chance to maladict them or to call for other \nmethods of aid to assist in killing them.  However, be warned \nbefore using these spells.  Each of these will have a certain \nspell lag time if you fail.  During this lag time, your opponent \nwill be made aware of the fact that you have tried to kill him or \nher, and will thus attack you.  If you are at low health, do not \ntry to cast one of these spells unless you are certain you will \nnot fail it.\n~\nE\nwar6~\nFor Necromancers - If you are a class with necromancy (every \ncaster class but elementalists) then ALWAYS use withstand death.  \nIf you are leveling, if you are out gathering funds, even if \nyou go into town to spell someone up, always have withstand \ndeath on.  This spell will enable you to \"cheat\" death.  Once \nyou have died, you will immediately return with a small percentage \nof your hp, giving you another chance to flee from your opponent.\n~\nE\nwar7~\nHealing In Combat - Healing while fighting is always a good \nidea.  For cleric classes, the healing group is very useful.  \nHowever, in order to conserve mana, if you are outside of \ncombat (i.e. flee then gate to a safe spot to heal) use the \n'cure critical' spell on yourself.  This spell, although it \nheals less hit points, also helps you to conserve your mana.  \nIf you are in combat, use the heal spell for quick hit point \nregeneration.  Also, gain the curative class.  This will enable \nyou to heal basic maledictions - poison, plague, and blindness.  \nIf you are a mage class, things are more difficult for you.  \nIt might be wise to carry around potions of cure serious (available \nfor sale at most clan hall shops).  Certain staves, wands, other \npotions, and pills also have healing abilities which can grant \nyou some health regeneration in combat.\n~\nE\nwar8~\nMaladict Your Enemy - As a caster, you most likely will not \nbe able to match a fighter when you compare your hit points \nand hits to his.  To even out combat, use maledictions.  For \nelementalists, you have a variety of powerful nature spells \nsuch as asphyxiate and irradiate which can make your opponent \nmuch weaker in combat.  For all other classes, the maledictions \ngroup will serve you well.  Poison and plague will slowly drain \naway an opponents health and mana, respectively, weaken will \nlower their strength attribute, blindess will take away their \nvision temporarily, curse will cause their deity to turn his \neyes from them, and energy drain, when it lands, helps you to \ndrain their mana and movement points.\n~\nE\nwar9~\nHunting - If you wish to hunt your opponent, take a few \nfactors into account.  Are they leveling? If so, what alignment \nare they?  What possible places could they be leveling in?  If \nthey are not leveling, use gate points to search around places \nwhere they could be gathering funds and also check town occasionally.  \nIf you're lucky, you may be able to catch them as they recall \nor return to their halls.\n~\nE\nwarend~\nThese tips are only a small portion of the true Art of War.  \nUse these to fight, but do not rely on them completely.  Every \nmage has his or her own way of combat.  With enough pkilling \nexperience, you will find yours.  Benefit from your mistakes, \nlearn from your errors, and remember, always defend the magic.\n{x\n  This work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However, this item does not exist in \nthis world in a form useful to us; instead, it has to be created.\n \nFirstly, a container suitable for the creation of this item is needed - the \nbinding kit.  This can be found on the Master Spell Binder in the High Tower of\nSorcery (gate master binder).  The first step towards creating a scroll is to \nstart with a blank one first; St. Bob's Map Shop has a large supply of blank \nscrolls at affordable prices.  In order for the scroll to have its binding \nproperties, the acquisition of a thread of binding silk from one of the \nnumerous spiders in this world which carry it is imperative.  Trying to track \ndown one of these can be laborious, so it is suggested to select the Queen \nSpider.  Finally, something is needed out of which the arcane symbols will be \nformed on the scroll.  A bottle of ink will not suffice as the magic held \nwithin the symbols will cause the ink to combust, destroying the scroll.  \nInstead, two diamonds need to be used.\n \nPlace the blank scroll, the thread of binding silk and the two diamonds into \nthe binding kit and head to the forge at the Midgaard Armourer. Type \"forge \nkit\" to set the magic in motion.  The two diamonds will shatter and the dust \nand the thread will merge into the blank scroll, forming the Scroll of Binding,\nretrievable from the binding kit.\n~\nE\nwiz2~\nThe cost of researching adamantite skin and incinerate is not cheap; they need \nsix eggs and eight eggs respectively.  The ingredients needed aren't the eggs \nthough, but sapphires formed from the eggs.  The Midgaard Jeweller possesses a \ncrucible which he has on sale which is needed to form the sapphires.  Although \nthis item is relatively cheap compared to the price of research, it wouldn't \nhurt to ask around to see if someone has one that they aren't using.\n \nSapphires are made at the forge at the Midgaard Armourer.  Place the required \nnumber of eggs into the jeweller's crucible and type \"forge crucible\".  The \neggs are then fused together to form the different sapphires.  Adamantite skin \nrequires two reflective sapphires made from three eggs each, while incinerate \nuses two fire sapphires made from four eggs each.\n \nFor more information reguarding the creation of sapphires, refer to the \nNovice's Guide to Jewelcraft, on sale at the Midgaard Jeweller when in stock.\n~\nE\nwiz3~\nIn order to research adamantite skin and incinerate, wizards need to be trained in this \nskill.  However, practicing research is fairly difficult and, considering the price of \nthese two spells, failure is costly.\nResearch can be practiced up to 95% and if you intend using it, it is advisable to get \nit this high.  If you don't wish to use all your practice sessions on research, ask if \nsomeone else in the clan can do it for you.  If you wish to do it yourself, take the \nfollowing into account:\n \nIntelligence at 20 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 21 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 22 increases research by 7% per prac.\nIntelligence at 23 increases research by 8% per prac.\nIntelligence at 24 increases research by 10% per prac.\nIntelligence at 25 increases research by 10% per prac.\nThis only applies when research is below 75%.  Any practice used after this only \nincreases it by 1%.  For this reason, you could attempt to save a practice session of \ntwo by reducing your intelligence to reach 74% to get the maximum out of your sessions.\n~\nE\nwiz4~\nAdamantite skin is the most powerful spell wizards can use to defend \nthemselves.  It is only available from level 50 at a cost of 150 mana and comes\nwith a considerable casting delay, but has an initial duration of 25 to 26 \nhours (casting level / 2 rounded down).  Each hit you deflect reduces the \nduration by 2 hours.\n \nTo create the scroll of adamantite skin, a scroll of binding, two reflective \nsapphires and a bar of adamantite are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for \ndetails on the scroll and sapphires.)  The bar of adamantite can be found north\nof the Master Enchanter in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The bar of adamantite and the sapphires \nwill begin fusing together while the binding forces are extended from the \nscroll.  When fused, the bar and sapphires will explode and, if the binding \nforces were aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy released will \nbe bound into the scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of \nadamantite skin.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz5~\nIncinerate is the fire version of acid blast, and most useful for making crispy\nyinns.  It is only available from level 38 at a cost of 50 mana.\n \nTo create the scroll of incineration, a scroll of binding, two fire sapphires \nand a rune of fire are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for details on the \nscroll and sapphires.)  The rune of fire can be found on the Greater Fire Demon\nin the depths of hell.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The fire sapphires will burst into \nflames to be absorbed by the rune of fire, causing the rune to harden and \nshatter.  The dust will then merge with the binding forces from the scroll and,\nif aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy will be bound into the \nscroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of incineration.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz6~\nNot all of the advanced spells have to be researched.  Steel skin and diamond \nskin can be found in Boinga, but these are nowhere near as powerful as \nadamanatite skin.\n \nSteel skin is available from level 35 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nmoderate casting delay, and has an initial duration of a mere 7 to 10 hours \n(casting level / 5 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on the steel \nclam, in Buccaneer Bay.\n \nDiamond skin is available from level 45 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nlengthy casting delay, and has an initial duration of 15 to 17 hours (casting \nlevel / 3 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on a diamond golem two \nrooms east and one room south of Ezmeralda in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nBoth these spells are copied in a magelab by holding the spell page and using \nthe \"copyspell\" command.  Each hit you deflect reduces the duration by 2 hours.\n~\nE\nwiz7~\nRivalling acid blast and incinerate, two new spells can be found; sunburst and\nsonic blast.\n \nSunburst is available from level 44 at a cost of 65 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast, but does light damage which can blind \nyour victim.  The spell page is found on the s'lu master in Altirin.\n \nSonic blast is available from level 45 at a cost of 75 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast as well, but has a chance to stun your \nvictim for a round or two.  The spell page is found on the yinnish monk in \nAltirin.\n~\nE\nwiz8~\nNot all combat spells come in the form of something that can do damage \ndirectly.  Some come in maladictive form, as is the case with flameseek.\n \nFlameseek is available from level 40 at a cost of 75 mana, and imparts a fire \nvuln on your victim.  Its affects will stay with your victim for 2 to 3 hours. \nThe spell page is found on the elemental guardian at the entrance to the \nElemental Plane of Fire.\n \nUsed in conjunction with fireball or incinerate, flameseek may result in \nseveral charred remains.  Welding torches and flamewhips also\nare handy with this spell.  Use this spell on slept victims,\nor to initiate combat.\n~\nE\nwizend~\nThis work covers a subject that is continually changing.\nFuture editions will be produced to cover what is learned in \nthe future.  Perhaps *your* work will be included.\nBenefit from your mistakes, learn from your errors, and \nremember, always defend the magic.\n \nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

However one must have a clue as to the creatures\nthat live in the destination area.  The following list\nhas been compiled by the sages of Warlock to aid the\ntraveller in this regard.  First some cautions for the\nnew Astral traveler.\n \n  1) Do not gate to an area you cannot handle!\n  2) The creature may be dead.  Thus your gate spell will fail.\n  3) A malicious renegade can summon your target creature\n     elsewhere to trap you.\n  4) The target creature may be cursed.  Your spell will fail.\n  5) The target creature may be charmed.  Your spell will fail.\n \n  Much of this information is also useful for the portal and\nnexus spells.  These spells are often under-utilized.  You \nmay wish to reflect on their use in your practice of magick.\n~\nE\nsilver1~\nArea                          Gate Post\n============================  ======================\nAltirin Forest                None\nArachnos                      Young spider\nAspen Penal Colony            Link angel\nAstral/Githyanki              Githzerai\nAvarice Clan Hall             Herald\nBalance Clan Hall             None\nBanshee                       None\nBathe House                   Desk clerk\nBluetspur                     Geist, jiakan, illithid\nBuccaneer Bay                 ?\nCamelot                       Black knight\nCampgrounds                   Faerie\nCastle Camorra                Apparition\nCastle Delain                 Delain guard\nCastle Trinity                Young warrior\nChapel Catacombs              Etcher\nChurch of Matook              None\nCity of Atlantis              Fido fish\nCity of Thieves               Cockroach\nCrescent Beach                Crane\nCuthbert's Fief               Firbolg\n~\nE\nsilver2~\nDangerous Neighborhood        Gang\nDen of Thieves                Guardian thief\nDescent to Hell               Coins, nose, weeds, burning fool, \n                              female construction worker, jury\nDragon Tower                  Draconian fool\nDrow City                     Drow commoner\nDwarven Catacombs             Grand templar\nDwarven Day Care              Doll\nDwarven Kingdom               None\nDylan's Area                  Harpy\nElemental Canyon              Bandit\nElemental Planes              ?\nElven High Court              None\nElven Printing Co             Printer\nEmerald Forest                Porcupine\nEnchanted Lake                Heap\nForbidden City                Fanatic\n~\nE\nsilver3~\nGalaxy                        Cepheus\nGhoul Forest                  Sassy, hungry ghoul\nGladiator Arena               None\nGnome Village                 Gnome child\nGraveyard                     ?\nGreat Pyramid                 Tomb\nGypsy Camp                    Bruno\nHall of Clan Bane             None\nHall of Ennoble               ?\nHall of the Apocalypse        None\nHaon Dor                      Warg\nHaunted House                 Rocking horse\nHigh Tower of Sorcery         Ezmerelda\nHoly Grove                    Hierophant\nIn the Air                    Faerie dragon\nIvory Stronghold              Dove\nKeep of Mahn-Tor              Tyrgoth\nKender Village                Kender mayor\n~\nE\nsilver4~\nLegion Clan Hall              None\nLimbo                         ?\nLost Bog                      None\nLost Catacombs                ?\nLost Ways                     ?\nLycanthropia                  Pooh\nMachine Dreams                None\nMega-City One                 Futsie\nMiden'nir                     Dark horseman\nMidgaard                      Vagabond\nMob Factory                   Toxic slime\nMoonstone Inn                 None\nMoria                         ?\nMystgar's Domain              Tetraps\nNew Ofcol                     Diana       \nNew Thalos                    Vulture\nNirvana                       None\nNottingham                    Merry man           \nNova Veesa                    3.bandit\n~\nE\nsilver5~\nOfcol                         Jacklyn\nOld Hall of Clan Circle       Circle guardian\nOld Marsh                     None\nOld Thalos                    Lamia\nOlympus                       Pegasus\nOrcs' Lair                    Orc leader\nPakat                         Indian fido\nPlains of the North           Sorbus, Aruncus\nPlane of Time                 Egg timer, split second, bedtime\nRainforest                    Crocodile\nRedferne's Residence          Grand knight\nSands of Sorrow               Scorpion\nSea of Serenity               None\nSecret Tomb                   Jade\nSewer                         Herald, 7.wererat etc\nShadowvale                    None\nShire                         Thain\nSmurf Village                 Smurfette\nSri Raji                      Indian fido\nStormy Mountain               Satyr\nSwimming Hole                 Beaver?\n~\nE\nsilver6~\nTemple o' Evil                Clan warrior\nTenochtitlan                  Aztec guard\nThalos                        Beholder\nTheatre of Boinga             Hamlet\nTroll Den                     None\nUnderSmurf                    None\nValley of the Elves           Antelope\nVillage Fair                  Baloo\nWarlock Clan Hall             Circle guardian, desk clerk\nWhore House                   (see city of thieves)\nWooster                       Security\nWyvern River                  Will-o-wisp\nWyvern's Tower                Black pudding, Elite gargoyle\nZealot Clan Hall              Sorbus, Aruncus\n \n============================================================\n~\nE\nsilverend~\nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

Some\nof our ancestors learned how to weave magical energies. \nUnfortunately, those who have been blessed with magic \nare also threatened by both renegades, and by those \nwho would seek to destroy those who are more powerful \nthan themselves.  To defend themselves against these \nrenegades, the magi have long ago developed an Art of War.\n{x\nAnazar of the Black Robes of Warlock passes along key\npoints in this art.\n~\nE\nwar1~\nKnow Your Enemy - Before you begin any pfight, always know who \nyou are fighting with.  Most races/remorts have a certain vulnerability \nwhich you can use against them in combat.  For example, you can use \nweapons with the \"flame\" noun to vuln yinns and if you are a mage/wizard, \nthe \"incinerate\" spell will also hurt them.  Also look at their class.  \nRealize that you will probably have a more difficult time casting a \nsleep spell on a berzerker than you would on a warrior for example.  \nThe mage who knows his or her opponent before battle will have a \nmuch easier time coming out of that battle alive.\n \n~\nE\nwar2~\nUse Your Spells As An Advantage - First and foremost, you \nare a caster.  You don't rely on hits like a fighter or stealth \nlike a thief.  You rely on your magic.  Use this to your ability.  \nDestroy your opponent with spells, catch them off-guard with your \nmagic.  If you choose to rely only on your hits to kill an enemy, \nbeing a caster, you will have a much harder fight on your hands.\n~\nE\nwar3~\nKnow When to Flee - A good fighter always knows his limits.  \nKnow yours.  There are a variety of things you can do to know \nwhen to flee.  Wimpy can help you automatically flee when you \nare very hurt.  Also, being mages, you have a variety of ways \nto escape combat besides just fleeing.  If you are a cleric \nclass, the \"mirror image\" spell in the psionics group will \nenable you to leave the room you were previously fighting in, \nwhile your opponent fights a temporary mirror image he thinks \nis you.  If you are an elementalist, nodes are meant to make \nyour life much easier.  Use them to your advantage.  Choose \nwisely when you pick a location to make your node as once you \ndo pick one, you won't be able to change your mind.  For other \ncasters, besides just spamming flee, you can use the transportation \ngroup to assist you.  Both the teleport and gate spells can help \nyou with this.  However, if you want to use one of these spells \nIN combat, use gate.  If you flee and then use a spell, you can \nuse either gate or teleport.  Do not try to use teleport in combat \nas its chances of succeeding are low and you will most likely fail.  \nYou can also try to use the recall spell in or out of combat.  \nCertain magical items such as wearing a compass, or quaffing a \njar of blood, may also assist you in escaping a fight.  Your \nlast option is to use deity gifts.  If you are pledge Hermes \nand have enough sac points, you can pray transport (if you aren't \ncursed) and this will be similar to casting teleport.  A better \noption than casting 'word of recall' would be to pray recall.  \nIf you cast 'word of recall' then you have some spell lag, and \nyour opponent may be able to catch you because of this.  Pray \nrecall however has no lag.  Once you pray for it, you arrive \ninstantly at Hassan, and can then walk quickly to your hall or \nto a place of safety.\n~\nE\nwar4~\nUse Your Class' Advantages - Every magic-using class has \nits own advantages.  For example, cleric classes can heal \nthemselves, wizards cast powerful maledictions, and elementalists \nhave a variety of interesting nature spells.  Learn how to use \nyour class effectively.  Learn its weaknesses and its strengths, \nas both of these will hurt and help you in combat.\n~\nE\nwar5~\nUse Spells Which Are Special To Your Class - Every caster \nclass has certain spells which only he or she can use.  For \nexample, crusaders have hold person elementalists have earthbind, \nand wizards have sleep.  Both of these spells can be used to \ncompletely immobilize your opponent for a period of time.  This \ncan give you the chance to maladict them or to call for other \nmethods of aid to assist in killing them.  However, be warned \nbefore using these spells.  Each of these will have a certain \nspell lag time if you fail.  During this lag time, your opponent \nwill be made aware of the fact that you have tried to kill him or \nher, and will thus attack you.  If you are at low health, do not \ntry to cast one of these spells unless you are certain you will \nnot fail it.\n~\nE\nwar6~\nFor Necromancers - If you are a class with necromancy (every \ncaster class but elementalists) then ALWAYS use withstand death.  \nIf you are leveling, if you are out gathering funds, even if \nyou go into town to spell someone up, always have withstand \ndeath on.  This spell will enable you to \"cheat\" death.  Once \nyou have died, you will immediately return with a small percentage \nof your hp, giving you another chance to flee from your opponent.\n~\nE\nwar7~\nHealing In Combat - Healing while fighting is always a good \nidea.  For cleric classes, the healing group is very useful.  \nHowever, in order to conserve mana, if you are outside of \ncombat (i.e. flee then gate to a safe spot to heal) use the \n'cure critical' spell on yourself.  This spell, although it \nheals less hit points, also helps you to conserve your mana.  \nIf you are in combat, use the heal spell for quick hit point \nregeneration.  Also, gain the curative class.  This will enable \nyou to heal basic maledictions - poison, plague, and blindness.  \nIf you are a mage class, things are more difficult for you.  \nIt might be wise to carry around potions of cure serious (available \nfor sale at most clan hall shops).  Certain staves, wands, other \npotions, and pills also have healing abilities which can grant \nyou some health regeneration in combat.\n~\nE\nwar8~\nMaladict Your Enemy - As a caster, you most likely will not \nbe able to match a fighter when you compare your hit points \nand hits to his.  To even out combat, use maledictions.  For \nelementalists, you have a variety of powerful nature spells \nsuch as asphyxiate and irradiate which can make your opponent \nmuch weaker in combat.  For all other classes, the maledictions \ngroup will serve you well.  Poison and plague will slowly drain \naway an opponents health and mana, respectively, weaken will \nlower their strength attribute, blindess will take away their \nvision temporarily, curse will cause their deity to turn his \neyes from them, and energy drain, when it lands, helps you to \ndrain their mana and movement points.\n~\nE\nwar9~\nHunting - If you wish to hunt your opponent, take a few \nfactors into account.  Are they leveling? If so, what alignment \nare they?  What possible places could they be leveling in?  If \nthey are not leveling, use gate points to search around places \nwhere they could be gathering funds and also check town occasionally.  \nIf you're lucky, you may be able to catch them as they recall \nor return to their halls.\n~\nE\nwarend~\nThese tips are only a small portion of the true Art of War.  \nUse these to fight, but do not rely on them completely.  Every \nmage has his or her own way of combat.  With enough pkilling \nexperience, you will find yours.  Benefit from your mistakes, \nlearn from your errors, and remember, always defend the magic.\n{x\n  This work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

It reads:\n \n\"Those who adorn the Red Robes of Warlock use their magical gifts to help \nwith clan responsibilities. Their neutrality gives them the clear minds to\nrecruit for each sect.

It falls to the red robes to help make it so as\nwe are the ones in the middle bridging the gap between white and\nblack.  Our primary goals as red robes are spelled out in the \ncharter:\n \n  1) Recruiting \n  2) Fund raising\n \nWe have secondary goals as well:\n \n  1) Assist black robes with punishment and retributions when\n     needed and feasible. (optional)\n  2) Assist white robes with research, equipping, and advising\n     young casters. (optional)\n  3) Keep up to date on clan activities and be a source of information\n     for other clan members. (required)\n~\nE\nredrobeleader~\nThis is a /5 position.

However, this item does not exist in \nthis world in a form useful to us; instead, it has to be created.\n \nFirstly, a container suitable for the creation of this item is needed - the \nbinding kit.  This can be found on the Master Spell Binder in the High Tower of\nSorcery (gate master binder).  The first step towards creating a scroll is to \nstart with a blank one first; St. Bob's Map Shop has a large supply of blank \nscrolls at affordable prices.  In order for the scroll to have its binding \nproperties, the acquisition of a thread of binding silk from one of the \nnumerous spiders in this world which carry it is imperative.  Trying to track \ndown one of these can be laborious, so it is suggested to select the Queen \nSpider.  Finally, something is needed out of which the arcane symbols will be \nformed on the scroll.  A bottle of ink will not suffice as the magic held \nwithin the symbols will cause the ink to combust, destroying the scroll.  \nInstead, two diamonds need to be used.\n \nPlace the blank scroll, the thread of binding silk and the two diamonds into \nthe binding kit and head to the forge at the Midgaard Armourer. Type \"forge \nkit\" to set the magic in motion.  The two diamonds will shatter and the dust \nand the thread will merge into the blank scroll, forming the Scroll of Binding,\nretrievable from the binding kit.\n~\nE\nwiz2~\nThe cost of researching adamantite skin and incinerate is not cheap; they need \nsix eggs and eight eggs respectively.  The ingredients needed aren't the eggs \nthough, but sapphires formed from the eggs.  The Midgaard Jeweller possesses a \ncrucible which he has on sale which is needed to form the sapphires.  Although \nthis item is relatively cheap compared to the price of research, it wouldn't \nhurt to ask around to see if someone has one that they aren't using.\n \nSapphires are made at the forge at the Midgaard Armourer.  Place the required \nnumber of eggs into the jeweller's crucible and type \"forge crucible\".  The \neggs are then fused together to form the different sapphires.  Adamantite skin \nrequires two reflective sapphires made from three eggs each, while incinerate \nuses two fire sapphires made from four eggs each.\n \nFor more information reguarding the creation of sapphires, refer to the \nNovice's Guide to Jewelcraft, on sale at the Midgaard Jeweller when in stock.\n~\nE\nwiz3~\nIn order to research adamantite skin and incinerate, wizards need to be trained in this \nskill.  However, practicing research is fairly difficult and, considering the price of \nthese two spells, failure is costly.\nResearch can be practiced up to 95% and if you intend using it, it is advisable to get \nit this high.  If you don't wish to use all your practice sessions on research, ask if \nsomeone else in the clan can do it for you.  If you wish to do it yourself, take the \nfollowing into account:\n \nIntelligence at 20 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 21 increases research by 6% per prac.\nIntelligence at 22 increases research by 7% per prac.\nIntelligence at 23 increases research by 8% per prac.\nIntelligence at 24 increases research by 10% per prac.\nIntelligence at 25 increases research by 10% per prac.\nThis only applies when research is below 75%.  Any practice used after this only \nincreases it by 1%.  For this reason, you could attempt to save a practice session of \ntwo by reducing your intelligence to reach 74% to get the maximum out of your sessions.\n~\nE\nwiz4~\nAdamantite skin is the most powerful spell wizards can use to defend \nthemselves.  It is only available from level 50 at a cost of 150 mana and comes\nwith a considerable casting delay, but has an initial duration of 25 to 26 \nhours (casting level / 2 rounded down).  Each hit you deflect reduces the \nduration by 2 hours.\n \nTo create the scroll of adamantite skin, a scroll of binding, two reflective \nsapphires and a bar of adamantite are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for \ndetails on the scroll and sapphires.)  The bar of adamantite can be found north\nof the Master Enchanter in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The bar of adamantite and the sapphires \nwill begin fusing together while the binding forces are extended from the \nscroll.  When fused, the bar and sapphires will explode and, if the binding \nforces were aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy released will \nbe bound into the scroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of \nadamantite skin.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz5~\nIncinerate is the fire version of acid blast, and most useful for making crispy\nyinns.  It is only available from level 38 at a cost of 50 mana.\n \nTo create the scroll of incineration, a scroll of binding, two fire sapphires \nand a rune of fire are required.  (Refer to pages 1 and 2 for details on the \nscroll and sapphires.)  The rune of fire can be found on the Greater Fire Demon\nin the depths of hell.\n \nPlace all ingredients directly into the magelab 2000 forge in the Mage's Guild \nin Midgaard and type \"forge magelab\".  The fire sapphires will burst into \nflames to be absorbed by the rune of fire, causing the rune to harden and \nshatter.  The dust will then merge with the binding forces from the scroll and,\nif aligned correctly by the wizard, the magical energy will be bound into the \nscroll, altering the runes and thus forming the scroll of incineration.\n \nThis scroll, once retrieved from the magelab, should be taken to our magelab, \nheld, and copied using the \"copyspell\" command.\n~\nE\nwiz6~\nNot all of the advanced spells have to be researched.  Steel skin and diamond \nskin can be found in Boinga, but these are nowhere near as powerful as \nadamanatite skin.\n \nSteel skin is available from level 35 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nmoderate casting delay, and has an initial duration of a mere 7 to 10 hours \n(casting level / 5 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on the steel \nclam, in Buccaneer Bay.\n \nDiamond skin is available from level 45 at a cost of 100 mana, comes with a \nlengthy casting delay, and has an initial duration of 15 to 17 hours (casting \nlevel / 3 rounded down).  The spell page can be found on a diamond golem two \nrooms east and one room south of Ezmeralda in the High Tower of Sorcery.\n \nBoth these spells are copied in a magelab by holding the spell page and using \nthe \"copyspell\" command.  Each hit you deflect reduces the duration by 2 hours.\n~\nE\nwiz7~\nRivalling acid blast and incinerate, two new spells can be found; sunburst and\nsonic blast.\n \nSunburst is available from level 44 at a cost of 65 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast, but does light damage which can blind \nyour victim.  The spell page is found on the s'lu master in Altirin.\n \nSonic blast is available from level 45 at a cost of 75 mana.  Its damage is \nslightly less than that of acid blast as well, but has a chance to stun your \nvictim for a round or two.  The spell page is found on the yinnish monk in \nAltirin.\n~\nE\nwiz8~\nNot all combat spells come in the form of something that can do damage \ndirectly.  Some come in maladictive form, as is the case with flameseek.\n \nFlameseek is available from level 40 at a cost of 75 mana, and imparts a fire \nvuln on your victim.  Its affects will stay with your victim for 2 to 3 hours. \nThe spell page is found on the elemental guardian at the entrance to the \nElemental Plane of Fire.\n \nUsed in conjunction with fireball or incinerate, flameseek may result in \nseveral charred remains.  Welding torches and flamewhips also\nare handy with this spell.  Use this spell on slept victims,\nor to initiate combat.\n~\nE\nwizend~\nThis work covers a subject that is continually changing.\nFuture editions will be produced to cover what is learned in \nthe future.  Perhaps *your* work will be included.\nBenefit from your mistakes, learn from your errors, and \nremember, always defend the magic.\n \nThis work is a product of funding, research, compilation,\nand publishing by the clan: Warlock.

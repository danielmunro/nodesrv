It is from\nhere that the mercenaries of Camorra launch their attacks, a dark and\nshadowy room that befits the secretive nature of this Clan.  Each portal\nitself, appears to be no more than just another shadow on the walls.\n \nThere is a small sign under the torch, just barely readable in this light.\n~\n0 CD 0\nD4\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4604\nE\nsign~\nThe Camorra Clan Portals\n \n'Enter haon' or 'Enter dor' to go to the Forest of Haon Dor\n'Enter Drow' to go to the Drow City\n'Enter Ancient' or 'Enter Thalos' to go to the City of Ancient Thalos\n'Enter Elemental' or 'Enter Canyon' to go to the Elemental Canyon\n'Enter Pyramid' to go to the Great Pyramid\n'Enter Sands' or 'Enter Sorrow' to go to the Sands of Sorrow\n \n~\nS\n#0\n\n#RESETS\nO 0 4601 100 4602\t* the hand of a battered statuette\nO 0 4608 100 4600\t* a gaping hole\nO 0 4609 100 4604\t* a cracked crystal sphere\nD 0 4600   0 16384\t* The Common Room of the Once Clan Camorra north\nD 0 4600   1 16387\t* The Common Room of the Once Clan Camorra east\nD 0 4600   3 16387\t* The Common Room of the Once Clan Camorra west\nD 0 4600   5 16384\t* The Common Room of the Once Clan Camorra down\nD 0 4601   1 16384\t* A (Safe)ty Deposit Box east\nD 0 4602   1 16384\t* The Board Room east\nD 0 4602   3 16387\t* The Board Room west\nD 0 4603   1 16387\t* Mamma's Kitchen east\nD 0 4604   1 16384\t* The Vault east\nD 0 4604   2 16384\t* The Vault south\nD 0 4604   3 16384\t* The Vault west\nD 0 4604   5 16384\t* The Vault down\nD 0 4605   3 16384\t* The Inner Office west\nD 0 4606   3 16384\t* A (Safe)ty Deposit Box west\nD 0 4607   4 16384\t* The Portal Room up\nS\n\n#SHOPS\n4601 10  0  0  0  0 \t1000 100 \t 0 23 \t* Mamma Maria\n0\n\n#SPECIALS\nM 4600 spec_cast_adept     \t* Tuck\nS\n\n#$\n","position":9028},"values":[{"header":"SPECIALS","command":"M","id":"4600","special":"spec_cast_adept","comment":"* Tuck"}]}]

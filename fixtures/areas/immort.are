The smells of fresh-brewed coffee and stale cigarette smoke\nthickly in the air.  As you walk toward the long counter, your shoes stick\nslightly to the gaudy yellow and green linoleum floor.  Behind the counter\nlie racks and racks of donuts, muffins, and other wonderful treats.\nIn front of the counter are several stools, all occupied by the regular\npatrons of the shop.  Each of them has a large cup of steaming, black\ncoffee and an over-flowing ashtray in front of them.\n \nThe largest booth lies in the only dark corner.  The red vinyl covering is \nalmost completely gone.  The seats seem to be composed almost entirely of\nsilver duct tape.  The biggest cup of coffee you've ever seen sits atop the\nwobbly table.  Right beside it is a old hubcap filled with cigarette butts,\na few pieces of heavily chewed gum, and, if you are not mistaken, a dead \nsquirrel.\n \n~\n0 CDNPT 0\nD5\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 3001\nE\ndonut muffin treat~\nThese racks contain every imaginable type of donut, as well as some you'd\nhave thought of yourself.  However, upon closer inspection, you realize that\nall the treats displayed here are grossly stale.  The mere thought of actually\neating one is enough to make you sick to your stomach.  The only donuts that\nseem even remotely fresh are the jelly-filled ones.  Perhaps someone\noccasionally buys and, if they are really brave, actually eats one.\n~\nE\nsquirrel~\nYep.. it is definately a squirrel.  However, upos closer inspection, you \nrealize it is not dead.  Its fur is singed in a few places from having \ncigarettes butted out on it, but, otherewize, it is in remarkably good\nshape.  The real question, though, is how it got there, and what reason\ncould it possibly have for taking up resisdence in an ashtray?\n~\nE\nstool patron booth~\nAll the booths and stools are covered with torn red vinyl.  Some of the \nlarger tears are repaired with sticky, silver duct tape.  The patrons\nseated on the stools are almost impossible to tell apart.  Each is clothed\nin faded blue jeans, a T-shirt, and a ratty old leather jacket.  The sheer\nvolume of smoke that rises from this small crowd is absolutely astonishing.\nIf you didn't know better, you'd swear that each was smoking at least four\nor five cigarettes at any given time.\n~\nE\nstool~\n~\nS\n#1243\nClan Dallas Hall~\nHere in Clan Dallas, you feel rather comfortable. Maybe it's those\nmagazines on the coffee table or the lazy-boy recliner you're sitting on,\nbut whatever it is, you're in heaven. In the corner is an antique cabinet\nwith a padlock to keep people like you out. Paintings of Dallas's clan life\nhang on the wall, reminding him of the old days. The mini-fridge sitting\nbeside the recliner is stuffed with beer bottles yet to be drank and it best\nstay that way. A plaque hangs on the wall telling anyone who wasn't invited\nhere to please leave before Dallas returns. Otherwise, you feel rather\npleasant relaxing in his lazy-boy.

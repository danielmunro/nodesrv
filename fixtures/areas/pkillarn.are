It'll save me the hassle when I'm\nin the middle of doing something else and somebody asks the well known\nQ: 'What's a BB?' Anyhow, take care an enjoy...\n \n-Pal\n~\nE\nIntro itro 2~\nWelcome to the Bloodbath(tm).  You've decided to read up on some of the\nmore bloodier aspects of the Moosehead Quest system.  The Bloodbath has\nbeen around as long as I have at least, and maybe then some.  It was\norginally created by Johnwa, by request of Nobody.  It was used on and off\nby the two to have scattered quests involving a no-kill area and space\nneeded to run around in while not haveing the quest inturropted.\nSoon after, I immed from Honor, and found that as much of a rush as \nImmhood was, it was damn boaring after the first week. So, while \nexploring the vnums in the mud, I stumbled onto this place.  After getting\nmy good bud Valder to make a portable portal to transport people there, I\nbegan to hold my first BB quests at level 53.  From there it evolved to\nwhere it is today.  \n \nThe Bloodbath, or BB for short, is a killing arena where you and several\nother players get in to butt egos to the death.  The place is No-die\n(which I shall explain later) meaning when you die you shall be regened\nat 1 hp with all your equiment.  It is also No-recall, meaning it's not\neasy wimp out.  Prizes for winning is usually cash with a note following\nsaying you bet the hell outta all who was against you.      -end\n~\nE\nrules 3~\nThe BB is ment to be fun and -relitively- fair.  You are all required to\nhave Nofollow active inside, meaning NO GROUPING PERMITTED.  Next, no\nmobs are permitted to be summoned or corpses reanimated, meaning\nNO CHARMIES PERMITTED.  Breaking of either of these rules will get you\nbooted from the BB at the very least, further punishment pending on the\nmood I'm in if you try and get smart with me.. ;/  But the most \nimportiant and deadly rule, is that there is to be NO STEALING, that\nranges from NO LOOTING, and -=* returning *=- of any picked up equiment.\nThe breaking of this rule will most likly send me off the edge..;p\nIf you want to find out what that will bring ya, well, try it sometime.;)\n \nOh, another rule I was forced to permit was for Loners and Outcasts, which\nis, if a Loner or Outcast was defeated in the BB, he/she/it will have a\n3 minute/5 tick grace, whichever comes first, to get to a safe place.\nIf this is violated from either the attacker, or abused from the \nOutcast or Loner, I won't hestitate get ya frozen.  Please abide by these\nrules, I would REALLY hate to have to imp any of em.  So far, it's been\na clean slate with the writing of this note.   -end\n~\nE\nprizes 4~\nPrizes are, as a rule, something I can make myself, I tried to run these\nquests without higher imm help.  It is usually a jewelled shard for\nwinning, and a shard for each kill you managed to get in that BB.\nOn request, I will check Puff to see if she has a fractical shard and\ngive that out as a prize instead.  As always, if you manage to find a heart\nANY heart and only hearts from a player in the battlefield, I'll give you\na heal potion for it.  Higher prizes MIGHT be included, but don't expect\nem, if there are I'll announce it beforehand.  -end\n~\nE\nloner 5~\nIf you take part in my BB, as a Loner or Outcast, you have my garenteed\nsafty that you'll not be attacked for 3 minutes/5 ticks.  If this is \nabused in ANY fashion, it's void, and your subject to the whimes of who\nis waxing the walls with yer blood.  On request, I'll let you hang in my\nBB startup room tell you get buffed up and ready to go out on your own.\nOh, if you start yelling to those inside, I'll slap a no_channels flag\non ya, I can do that now. ;)  -end\n~\nE\ndisa 6~\nThe BB is garenteed NO_LOOT, if somebody voiloates this, you'll get your\nequiments back and I'll bust em for you.  If either of you try to scam\nme, we'll get the logs checked and the lier will get frozen. ;)  \nFor disarmed weapons, let me know who picked it up, and I'll get it back.\nMost are extreamly honest in this respect, thank gawd. ;p  If you use\nhard to get orginal weapons, highly enchanted, special restrings, ect.\nIt is much easer to track down.  For equiment lost due to lost str, I'll\ndo my best, but you best watch your strength yourself and try not to\nfuck yerself over. ;)    -end\n~\nE\nsrse 7~\nThe Bloodbath(tm) was contributed to by the following people...\n1> Rusty --- Well, it IS his mud.\n2> Johnwa -- Thanks john for letting me have access to the BB vnums.  He \n             made the first BB.\n3> Nobody -- He helped john come up with the idea, and help several BB's \n             himself, he also made the current maze it is today.\n4> Bloodmoon!!! - It was her sadistic bloodthirsty personality that made\n                  me hungry for more BLOOD(baths)...!  I helped her on a\n                  small minny BB one night and well, I got addicted! ;)\nSoviet, Rage, Scorn, Scintilla, Harald, Valder, Krantz, Daisy, Delstar\nblah blah blah.

The area is no_die so you will `repop' in your clan hall\n   (Matook for you loners and outcasts) with your equ intact.  A word of\n   advice, relog.  When you die in a no_die area you AC gets a bit screewed\n   up and a simple relog shall fix that.\n2) Outcasts and loners have no fear of being looted at matook.  I give you a\n   2 minute free passage (or 5 ticks, where ever comes first) to get to a\n   safe place and regen.  If someone kills you in that time after getting\n   defeated from my bloodbath you'll get your equ back.  If I find you\n   were abusing this free grace then your phucked.\n3) Once inside the bloodbath you will be put in a small regen room with\n   everybody else.  Talk, brag, trade equ, but if you attack your out.\n   There is -NO- Stealing anywhere in my quests, do so and I'll get ya\n   frozen for a month.  There is in excuse for stealing.  Once I give the\n   word you spell up inside the room and then when everybody is ready I\n   open the door and you leave east then start to kill.\n4) Disarmed weapons will be returned, just keep track who picked it up, I\n   cannot return a weapon if I don't know who has it.\n5) -=NO=- Charmies..  that included skelly warriors, animated corpses, and\n   summoned charmies.  This also includes summoning someone else into\n   the bloodbath that was not a starting member or was previously defeated.\n6) Potions, staves, wands are permitted.  If you happened to toast a person\n   Inside the Bloodbath and get a heart, find me and I'll trade you the heart\n   for a heal potion.\n7) Rewards is a shard for winning and a shard per kill.  You also have the\n   option of asking me to check to see if Puff has a fractial shard on her, if\n   so, it's yours.  Weather she has it or not though, you'll lose all rights to\n   the cash prize.\n8) I cannot remove or give back KILLER or THIEF flags, so don't ask me.\n9) If you happen to have to relog, you can risk it and lose link inside\n   the bloodbath or you can try and find the portal out and leave, your\n   choice, but if you leave you do not get to go back inside.  That's that.\nGood luck and hope you enjoy the Bloodbath!(tm)\n-Pal\n-Soviet\n~\n#726\nTownhomes Homes Houses~\nthe hazy mist~\n~\n~\nportal ORSTY P\n0 0 0 30000 0\n0 100 0 P\n#727\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\na bloodbath portal~\nA shimmering poral to the Bloodbaths.~\nMagic~\nportal AIORSTY APQ\n0 0 0 730 0\n25 10000 1 P\nE\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\nYour see before you a swirling red portal leading to a plane of death\nand sport enjoyed by the gods at the expense of hapless morts.

It'll save me the hassle when I'm\nin the middle of doing something else and somebody asks the well known\nQ: 'What's a BB?' Anyhow, take care an enjoy...\n \n-Pal\n~\nE\nIntro itro 2~\nWelcome to the Bloodbath(tm).  You've decided to read up on some of the\nmore bloodier aspects of the Moosehead Quest system.  The Bloodbath has\nbeen around as long as I have at least, and maybe then some.  It was\norginally created by Johnwa, by request of Nobody.  It was used on and off\nby the two to have scattered quests involving a no-kill area and space\nneeded to run around in while not haveing the quest inturropted.\nSoon after, I immed from Honor, and found that as much of a rush as \nImmhood was, it was damn boaring after the first week. So, while \nexploring the vnums in the mud, I stumbled onto this place.  After getting\nmy good bud Valder to make a portable portal to transport people there, I\nbegan to hold my first BB quests at level 53.  From there it evolved to\nwhere it is today.  \n \nThe Bloodbath, or BB for short, is a killing arena where you and several\nother players get in to butt egos to the death.  The place is No-die\n(which I shall explain later) meaning when you die you shall be regened\nat 1 hp with all your equiment.  It is also No-recall, meaning it's not\neasy wimp out.  Prizes for winning is usually cash with a note following\nsaying you bet the hell outta all who was against you.      -end\n~\nE\nrules 3~\nThe BB is ment to be fun and -relitively- fair.  You are all required to\nhave Nofollow active inside, meaning NO GROUPING PERMITTED.  Next, no\nmobs are permitted to be summoned or corpses reanimated, meaning\nNO CHARMIES PERMITTED.  Breaking of either of these rules will get you\nbooted from the BB at the very least, further punishment pending on the\nmood I'm in if you try and get smart with me.. ;/  But the most \nimportiant and deadly rule, is that there is to be NO STEALING, that\nranges from NO LOOTING, and -=* returning *=- of any picked up equiment.\nThe breaking of this rule will most likly send me off the edge..;p\nIf you want to find out what that will bring ya, well, try it sometime.;)\n \nOh, another rule I was forced to permit was for Loners and Outcasts, which\nis, if a Loner or Outcast was defeated in the BB, he/she/it will have a\n3 minute/5 tick grace, whichever comes first, to get to a safe place.\nIf this is violated from either the attacker, or abused from the \nOutcast or Loner, I won't hestitate get ya frozen.  Please abide by these\nrules, I would REALLY hate to have to imp any of em.  So far, it's been\na clean slate with the writing of this note.   -end\n~\nE\nprizes 4~\nPrizes are, as a rule, something I can make myself, I tried to run these\nquests without higher imm help.  It is usually a jewelled shard for\nwinning, and a shard for each kill you managed to get in that BB.\nOn request, I will check Puff to see if she has a fractical shard and\ngive that out as a prize instead.  As always, if you manage to find a heart\nANY heart and only hearts from a player in the battlefield, I'll give you\na heal potion for it.  Higher prizes MIGHT be included, but don't expect\nem, if there are I'll announce it beforehand.  -end\n~\nE\nloner 5~\nIf you take part in my BB, as a Loner or Outcast, you have my garenteed\nsafty that you'll not be attacked for 3 minutes/5 ticks.  If this is \nabused in ANY fashion, it's void, and your subject to the whimes of who\nis waxing the walls with yer blood.  On request, I'll let you hang in my\nBB startup room tell you get buffed up and ready to go out on your own.\nOh, if you start yelling to those inside, I'll slap a no_channels flag\non ya, I can do that now. ;)  -end\n~\nE\ndisa 6~\nThe BB is garenteed NO_LOOT, if somebody voiloates this, you'll get your\nequiments back and I'll bust em for you.  If either of you try to scam\nme, we'll get the logs checked and the lier will get frozen. ;)  \nFor disarmed weapons, let me know who picked it up, and I'll get it back.\nMost are extreamly honest in this respect, thank gawd. ;p  If you use\nhard to get orginal weapons, highly enchanted, special restrings, ect.\nIt is much easer to track down.  For equiment lost due to lost str, I'll\ndo my best, but you best watch your strength yourself and try not to\nfuck yerself over. ;)    -end\n~\nE\nsrse 7~\nThe Bloodbath(tm) was contributed to by the following people...\n1> Rusty --- Well, it IS his mud.\n2> Johnwa -- Thanks john for letting me have access to the BB vnums.  He \n             made the first BB.\n3> Nobody -- He helped john come up with the idea, and help several BB's \n             himself, he also made the current maze it is today.\n4> Bloodmoon!!! - It was her sadistic bloodthirsty personality that made\n                  me hungry for more BLOOD(baths)...!

The area is no_die so you will `repop' in your clan hall\n   (Matook for you loners and outcasts) with your equ intact.  A word of\n   advice, relog.  When you die in a no_die area you AC gets a bit screewed\n   up and a simple relog shall fix that.\n2) Outcasts and loners have no fear of being looted at matook.  I give you a\n   2 minute free passage (or 5 ticks, where ever comes first) to get to a\n   safe place and regen.  If someone kills you in that time after getting\n   defeated from my bloodbath you'll get your equ back.  If I find you\n   were abusing this free grace then your phucked.\n3) Once inside the bloodbath you will be put in a small regen room with\n   everybody else.  Talk, brag, trade equ, but if you attack your out.\n   There is -NO- Stealing anywhere in my quests, do so and I'll get ya\n   frozen for a month.  There is in excuse for stealing.  Once I give the\n   word you spell up inside the room and then when everybody is ready I\n   open the door and you leave east then start to kill.\n4) Disarmed weapons will be returned, just keep track who picked it up, I\n   cannot return a weapon if I don't know who has it.\n5) -=NO=- Charmies..  that included skelly warriors, animated corpses, and\n   summoned charmies.  This also includes summoning someone else into\n   the bloodbath that was not a starting member or was previously defeated.\n6) Potions, staves, wands are permitted.  If you happened to toast a person\n   Inside the Bloodbath and get a heart, find me and I'll trade you the heart\n   for a heal potion.\n7) Rewards is a shard for winning and a shard per kill.  You also have the\n   option of asking me to check to see if Puff has a fractial shard on her, if\n   so, it's yours.  Weather she has it or not though, you'll lose all rights to\n   the cash prize.\n8) I cannot remove or give back KILLER or THIEF flags, so don't ask me.\n9) If you happen to have to relog, you can risk it and lose link inside\n   the bloodbath or you can try and find the portal out and leave, your\n   choice, but if you leave you do not get to go back inside.  That's that.\nGood luck and hope you enjoy the Bloodbath!(tm)\n-Pal\n-Soviet\n~\n#726\nTownhomes Homes Houses~\nthe hazy mist~\n~\n~\nportal ORSTY P\n0 0 0 30000 0\n0 100 0 P\n#727\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\na bloodbath portal~\nA shimmering poral to the Bloodbaths.~\nMagic~\nportal AIORSTY APQ\n0 0 0 730 0\n25 10000 1 P\nE\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\nYour see before you a swirling red portal leading to a plane of death\nand sport enjoyed by the gods at the expense of hapless morts.

It'll save me the hassle when I'm\nin the middle of doing something else and somebody asks the well known\nQ: 'What's a BB?' Anyhow, take care an enjoy...\n \n-Pal\n~\nE\nIntro itro 2~\nWelcome to the Bloodbath(tm).  You've decided to read up on some of the\nmore bloodier aspects of the Moosehead Quest system.  The Bloodbath has\nbeen around as long as I have at least, and maybe then some.  It was\norginally created by Johnwa, by request of Nobody.  It was used on and off\nby the two to have scattered quests involving a no-kill area and space\nneeded to run around in while not haveing the quest inturropted.\nSoon after, I immed from Honor, and found that as much of a rush as \nImmhood was, it was damn boaring after the first week. So, while \nexploring the vnums in the mud, I stumbled onto this place.  After getting\nmy good bud Valder to make a portable portal to transport people there, I\nbegan to hold my first BB quests at level 53.  From there it evolved to\nwhere it is today.  \n \nThe Bloodbath, or BB for short, is a killing arena where you and several\nother players get in to butt egos to the death.  The place is No-die\n(which I shall explain later) meaning when you die you shall be regened\nat 1 hp with all your equiment.  It is also No-recall, meaning it's not\neasy wimp out.  Prizes for winning is usually cash with a note following\nsaying you bet the hell outta all who was against you.      -end\n~\nE\nrules 3~\nThe BB is ment to be fun and -relitively- fair.  You are all required to\nhave Nofollow active inside, meaning NO GROUPING PERMITTED.  Next, no\nmobs are permitted to be summoned or corpses reanimated, meaning\nNO CHARMIES PERMITTED.  Breaking of either of these rules will get you\nbooted from the BB at the very least, further punishment pending on the\nmood I'm in if you try and get smart with me.. ;/  But the most \nimportiant and deadly rule, is that there is to be NO STEALING, that\nranges from NO LOOTING, and -=* returning *=- of any picked up equiment.\nThe breaking of this rule will most likly send me off the edge..;p\nIf you want to find out what that will bring ya, well, try it sometime.;)\n \nOh, another rule I was forced to permit was for Loners and Outcasts, which\nis, if a Loner or Outcast was defeated in the BB, he/she/it will have a\n3 minute/5 tick grace, whichever comes first, to get to a safe place.\nIf this is violated from either the attacker, or abused from the \nOutcast or Loner, I won't hestitate get ya frozen.  Please abide by these\nrules, I would REALLY hate to have to imp any of em.  So far, it's been\na clean slate with the writing of this note.   -end\n~\nE\nprizes 4~\nPrizes are, as a rule, something I can make myself, I tried to run these\nquests without higher imm help.  It is usually a jewelled shard for\nwinning, and a shard for each kill you managed to get in that BB.\nOn request, I will check Puff to see if she has a fractical shard and\ngive that out as a prize instead.  As always, if you manage to find a heart\nANY heart and only hearts from a player in the battlefield, I'll give you\na heal potion for it.  Higher prizes MIGHT be included, but don't expect\nem, if there are I'll announce it beforehand.  -end\n~\nE\nloner 5~\nIf you take part in my BB, as a Loner or Outcast, you have my garenteed\nsafty that you'll not be attacked for 3 minutes/5 ticks.  If this is \nabused in ANY fashion, it's void, and your subject to the whimes of who\nis waxing the walls with yer blood.  On request, I'll let you hang in my\nBB startup room tell you get buffed up and ready to go out on your own.\nOh, if you start yelling to those inside, I'll slap a no_channels flag\non ya, I can do that now. ;)  -end\n~\nE\ndisa 6~\nThe BB is garenteed NO_LOOT, if somebody voiloates this, you'll get your\nequiments back and I'll bust em for you.  If either of you try to scam\nme, we'll get the logs checked and the lier will get frozen. ;)  \nFor disarmed weapons, let me know who picked it up, and I'll get it back.\nMost are extreamly honest in this respect, thank gawd. ;p  If you use\nhard to get orginal weapons, highly enchanted, special restrings, ect.\nIt is much easer to track down.

The area is no_die so you will `repop' in your clan hall\n   (Matook for you loners and outcasts) with your equ intact.  A word of\n   advice, relog.  When you die in a no_die area you AC gets a bit screewed\n   up and a simple relog shall fix that.\n2) Outcasts and loners have no fear of being looted at matook.  I give you a\n   2 minute free passage (or 5 ticks, where ever comes first) to get to a\n   safe place and regen.  If someone kills you in that time after getting\n   defeated from my bloodbath you'll get your equ back.  If I find you\n   were abusing this free grace then your phucked.\n3) Once inside the bloodbath you will be put in a small regen room with\n   everybody else.  Talk, brag, trade equ, but if you attack your out.\n   There is -NO- Stealing anywhere in my quests, do so and I'll get ya\n   frozen for a month.  There is in excuse for stealing.  Once I give the\n   word you spell up inside the room and then when everybody is ready I\n   open the door and you leave east then start to kill.\n4) Disarmed weapons will be returned, just keep track who picked it up, I\n   cannot return a weapon if I don't know who has it.\n5) -=NO=- Charmies..  that included skelly warriors, animated corpses, and\n   summoned charmies.  This also includes summoning someone else into\n   the bloodbath that was not a starting member or was previously defeated.\n6) Potions, staves, wands are permitted.  If you happened to toast a person\n   Inside the Bloodbath and get a heart, find me and I'll trade you the heart\n   for a heal potion.\n7) Rewards is a shard for winning and a shard per kill.  You also have the\n   option of asking me to check to see if Puff has a fractial shard on her, if\n   so, it's yours.  Weather she has it or not though, you'll lose all rights to\n   the cash prize.\n8) I cannot remove or give back KILLER or THIEF flags, so don't ask me.\n9) If you happen to have to relog, you can risk it and lose link inside\n   the bloodbath or you can try and find the portal out and leave, your\n   choice, but if you leave you do not get to go back inside.

You've decided to read up on some of the\nmore bloodier aspects of the Moosehead Quest system.  The Bloodbath has\nbeen around as long as I have at least, and maybe then some.

It was used on and off\nby the two to have scattered quests involving a no-kill area and space\nneeded to run around in while not haveing the quest inturropted.\nSoon after, I immed from Honor, and found that as much of a rush as \nImmhood was, it was damn boaring after the first week. So, while \nexploring the vnums in the mud, I stumbled onto this place.  After getting\nmy good bud Valder to make a portable portal to transport people there, I\nbegan to hold my first BB quests at level 53.  From there it evolved to\nwhere it is today.  \n \nThe Bloodbath, or BB for short, is a killing arena where you and several\nother players get in to butt egos to the death.  The place is No-die\n(which I shall explain later) meaning when you die you shall be regened\nat 1 hp with all your equiment.  It is also No-recall, meaning it's not\neasy wimp out.  Prizes for winning is usually cash with a note following\nsaying you bet the hell outta all who was against you.      -end","The BB is ment to be fun and -relitively- fair.

The area is no_die so you will `repop' in your clan hall\n   (Matook for you loners and outcasts) with your equ intact.  A word of\n   advice, relog.  When you die in a no_die area you AC gets a bit screewed\n   up and a simple relog shall fix that.\n2) Outcasts and loners have no fear of being looted at matook.  I give you a\n   2 minute free passage (or 5 ticks, where ever comes first) to get to a\n   safe place and regen.  If someone kills you in that time after getting\n   defeated from my bloodbath you'll get your equ back.  If I find you\n   were abusing this free grace then your phucked.\n3) Once inside the bloodbath you will be put in a small regen room with\n   everybody else.  Talk, brag, trade equ, but if you attack your out.\n   There is -NO- Stealing anywhere in my quests, do so and I'll get ya\n   frozen for a month.  There is in excuse for stealing.  Once I give the\n   word you spell up inside the room and then when everybody is ready I\n   open the door and you leave east then start to kill.\n4) Disarmed weapons will be returned, just keep track who picked it up, I\n   cannot return a weapon if I don't know who has it.\n5) -=NO=- Charmies..  that included skelly warriors, animated corpses, and\n   summoned charmies.  This also includes summoning someone else into\n   the bloodbath that was not a starting member or was previously defeated.\n6) Potions, staves, wands are permitted.  If you happened to toast a person\n   Inside the Bloodbath and get a heart, find me and I'll trade you the heart\n   for a heal potion.\n7) Rewards is a shard for winning and a shard per kill.  You also have the\n   option of asking me to check to see if Puff has a fractial shard on her, if\n   so, it's yours.  Weather she has it or not though, you'll lose all rights to\n   the cash prize.\n8) I cannot remove or give back KILLER or THIEF flags, so don't ask me.\n9) If you happen to have to relog, you can risk it and lose link inside\n   the bloodbath or you can try and find the portal out and leave, your\n   choice, but if you leave you do not get to go back inside.

It'll save me the hassle when I'm\nin the middle of doing something else and somebody asks the well known\nQ: 'What's a BB?' Anyhow, take care an enjoy...\n \n-Pal\n~\nE\nIntro itro 2~\nWelcome to the Bloodbath(tm).  You've decided to read up on some of the\nmore bloodier aspects of the Moosehead Quest system.  The Bloodbath has\nbeen around as long as I have at least, and maybe then some.  It was\norginally created by Johnwa, by request of Nobody.  It was used on and off\nby the two to have scattered quests involving a no-kill area and space\nneeded to run around in while not haveing the quest inturropted.\nSoon after, I immed from Honor, and found that as much of a rush as \nImmhood was, it was damn boaring after the first week. So, while \nexploring the vnums in the mud, I stumbled onto this place.  After getting\nmy good bud Valder to make a portable portal to transport people there, I\nbegan to hold my first BB quests at level 53.  From there it evolved to\nwhere it is today.  \n \nThe Bloodbath, or BB for short, is a killing arena where you and several\nother players get in to butt egos to the death.  The place is No-die\n(which I shall explain later) meaning when you die you shall be regened\nat 1 hp with all your equiment.  It is also No-recall, meaning it's not\neasy wimp out.  Prizes for winning is usually cash with a note following\nsaying you bet the hell outta all who was against you.      -end\n~\nE\nrules 3~\nThe BB is ment to be fun and -relitively- fair.  You are all required to\nhave Nofollow active inside, meaning NO GROUPING PERMITTED.  Next, no\nmobs are permitted to be summoned or corpses reanimated, meaning\nNO CHARMIES PERMITTED.  Breaking of either of these rules will get you\nbooted from the BB at the very least, further punishment pending on the\nmood I'm in if you try and get smart with me.. ;/  But the most \nimportiant and deadly rule, is that there is to be NO STEALING, that\nranges from NO LOOTING, and -=* returning *=- of any picked up equiment.\nThe breaking of this rule will most likly send me off the edge..;p\nIf you want to find out what that will bring ya, well, try it sometime.;)\n \nOh, another rule I was forced to permit was for Loners and Outcasts, which\nis, if a Loner or Outcast was defeated in the BB, he/she/it will have a\n3 minute/5 tick grace, whichever comes first, to get to a safe place.\nIf this is violated from either the attacker, or abused from the \nOutcast or Loner, I won't hestitate get ya frozen.  Please abide by these\nrules, I would REALLY hate to have to imp any of em.  So far, it's been\na clean slate with the writing of this note.   -end\n~\nE\nprizes 4~\nPrizes are, as a rule, something I can make myself, I tried to run these\nquests without higher imm help.  It is usually a jewelled shard for\nwinning, and a shard for each kill you managed to get in that BB.\nOn request, I will check Puff to see if she has a fractical shard and\ngive that out as a prize instead.  As always, if you manage to find a heart\nANY heart and only hearts from a player in the battlefield, I'll give you\na heal potion for it.  Higher prizes MIGHT be included, but don't expect\nem, if there are I'll announce it beforehand.  -end\n~\nE\nloner 5~\nIf you take part in my BB, as a Loner or Outcast, you have my garenteed\nsafty that you'll not be attacked for 3 minutes/5 ticks.  If this is \nabused in ANY fashion, it's void, and your subject to the whimes of who\nis waxing the walls with yer blood.  On request, I'll let you hang in my\nBB startup room tell you get buffed up and ready to go out on your own.\nOh, if you start yelling to those inside, I'll slap a no_channels flag\non ya, I can do that now. ;)  -end\n~\nE\ndisa 6~\nThe BB is garenteed NO_LOOT, if somebody voiloates this, you'll get your\nequiments back and I'll bust em for you.  If either of you try to scam\nme, we'll get the logs checked and the lier will get frozen. ;)  \nFor disarmed weapons, let me know who picked it up, and I'll get it back.\nMost are extreamly honest in this respect, thank gawd. ;p  If you use\nhard to get orginal weapons, highly enchanted, special restrings, ect.\nIt is much easer to track down.  For equiment lost due to lost str, I'll\ndo my best, but you best watch your strength yourself and try not to\nfuck yerself over. ;)    -end\n~\nE\nsrse 7~\nThe Bloodbath(tm) was contributed to by the following people...\n1> Rusty --- Well, it IS his mud.\n2> Johnwa -- Thanks john for letting me have access to the BB vnums.  He \n             made the first BB.\n3> Nobody -- He helped john come up with the idea, and help several BB's \n             himself, he also made the current maze it is today.\n4> Bloodmoon!!! - It was her sadistic bloodthirsty personality that made\n                  me hungry for more BLOOD(baths)...!

Once I give the\n   word you spell up inside the room and then when everybody is ready I\n   open the door and you leave east then start to kill.\n4) Disarmed weapons will be returned, just keep track who picked it up, I\n   cannot return a weapon if I don't know who has it.\n5) -=NO=- Charmies..  that included skelly warriors, animated corpses, and\n   summoned charmies.  This also includes summoning someone else into\n   the bloodbath that was not a starting member or was previously defeated.\n6) Potions, staves, wands are permitted.  If you happened to toast a person\n   Inside the Bloodbath and get a heart, find me and I'll trade you the heart\n   for a heal potion.\n7) Rewards is a shard for winning and a shard per kill.  You also have the\n   option of asking me to check to see if Puff has a fractial shard on her, if\n   so, it's yours.  Weather she has it or not though, you'll lose all rights to\n   the cash prize.\n8) I cannot remove or give back KILLER or THIEF flags, so don't ask me.\n9) If you happen to have to relog, you can risk it and lose link inside\n   the bloodbath or you can try and find the portal out and leave, your\n   choice, but if you leave you do not get to go back inside.  That's that.\nGood luck and hope you enjoy the Bloodbath!(tm)\n-Pal\n-Soviet\n~\n#726\nTownhomes Homes Houses~\nthe hazy mist~\n~\n~\nportal ORSTY P\n0 0 0 30000 0\n0 100 0 P\n#727\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\na bloodbath portal~\nA shimmering poral to the Bloodbaths.~\nMagic~\nportal AIORSTY APQ\n0 0 0 730 0\n25 10000 1 P\nE\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\nYour see before you a swirling red portal leading to a plane of death\nand sport enjoyed by the gods at the expense of hapless morts.

It'll save me the hassle when I'm\nin the middle of doing something else and somebody asks the well known\nQ: 'What's a BB?' Anyhow, take care an enjoy...\n \n-Pal\n~\nE\nIntro itro 2~\nWelcome to the Bloodbath(tm).  You've decided to read up on some of the\nmore bloodier aspects of the Moosehead Quest system.  The Bloodbath has\nbeen around as long as I have at least, and maybe then some.  It was\norginally created by Johnwa, by request of Nobody.  It was used on and off\nby the two to have scattered quests involving a no-kill area and space\nneeded to run around in while not haveing the quest inturropted.\nSoon after, I immed from Honor, and found that as much of a rush as \nImmhood was, it was damn boaring after the first week. So, while \nexploring the vnums in the mud, I stumbled onto this place.  After getting\nmy good bud Valder to make a portable portal to transport people there, I\nbegan to hold my first BB quests at level 53.  From there it evolved to\nwhere it is today.  \n \nThe Bloodbath, or BB for short, is a killing arena where you and several\nother players get in to butt egos to the death.  The place is No-die\n(which I shall explain later) meaning when you die you shall be regened\nat 1 hp with all your equiment.  It is also No-recall, meaning it's not\neasy wimp out.  Prizes for winning is usually cash with a note following\nsaying you bet the hell outta all who was against you.      -end\n~\nE\nrules 3~\nThe BB is ment to be fun and -relitively- fair.  You are all required to\nhave Nofollow active inside, meaning NO GROUPING PERMITTED.  Next, no\nmobs are permitted to be summoned or corpses reanimated, meaning\nNO CHARMIES PERMITTED.  Breaking of either of these rules will get you\nbooted from the BB at the very least, further punishment pending on the\nmood I'm in if you try and get smart with me.. ;/  But the most \nimportiant and deadly rule, is that there is to be NO STEALING, that\nranges from NO LOOTING, and -=* returning *=- of any picked up equiment.\nThe breaking of this rule will most likly send me off the edge..;p\nIf you want to find out what that will bring ya, well, try it sometime.;)\n \nOh, another rule I was forced to permit was for Loners and Outcasts, which\nis, if a Loner or Outcast was defeated in the BB, he/she/it will have a\n3 minute/5 tick grace, whichever comes first, to get to a safe place.\nIf this is violated from either the attacker, or abused from the \nOutcast or Loner, I won't hestitate get ya frozen.  Please abide by these\nrules, I would REALLY hate to have to imp any of em.  So far, it's been\na clean slate with the writing of this note.   -end\n~\nE\nprizes 4~\nPrizes are, as a rule, something I can make myself, I tried to run these\nquests without higher imm help.  It is usually a jewelled shard for\nwinning, and a shard for each kill you managed to get in that BB.\nOn request, I will check Puff to see if she has a fractical shard and\ngive that out as a prize instead.  As always, if you manage to find a heart\nANY heart and only hearts from a player in the battlefield, I'll give you\na heal potion for it.  Higher prizes MIGHT be included, but don't expect\nem, if there are I'll announce it beforehand.  -end\n~\nE\nloner 5~\nIf you take part in my BB, as a Loner or Outcast, you have my garenteed\nsafty that you'll not be attacked for 3 minutes/5 ticks.  If this is \nabused in ANY fashion, it's void, and your subject to the whimes of who\nis waxing the walls with yer blood.  On request, I'll let you hang in my\nBB startup room tell you get buffed up and ready to go out on your own.\nOh, if you start yelling to those inside, I'll slap a no_channels flag\non ya, I can do that now. ;)  -end\n~\nE\ndisa 6~\nThe BB is garenteed NO_LOOT, if somebody voiloates this, you'll get your\nequiments back and I'll bust em for you.  If either of you try to scam\nme, we'll get the logs checked and the lier will get frozen. ;)  \nFor disarmed weapons, let me know who picked it up, and I'll get it back.\nMost are extreamly honest in this respect, thank gawd. ;p  If you use\nhard to get orginal weapons, highly enchanted, special restrings, ect.\nIt is much easer to track down.  For equiment lost due to lost str, I'll\ndo my best, but you best watch your strength yourself and try not to\nfuck yerself over. ;)    -end\n~\nE\nsrse 7~\nThe Bloodbath(tm) was contributed to by the following people...\n1> Rusty --- Well, it IS his mud.\n2> Johnwa -- Thanks john for letting me have access to the BB vnums.  He \n             made the first BB.\n3> Nobody -- He helped john come up with the idea, and help several BB's \n             himself, he also made the current maze it is today.\n4> Bloodmoon!!! - It was her sadistic bloodthirsty personality that made\n                  me hungry for more BLOOD(baths)...!  I helped her on a\n                  small minny BB one night and well, I got addicted! ;)\nSoviet, Rage, Scorn, Scintilla, Harald, Valder, Krantz, Daisy, Delstar\nblah blah blah.  Basicly, ALL the imms helped in one way or another.  \nI still can't do a global echo, or a restore myself. ;)  It is thanks\nto whomever is on that gives me a hand.  thanks guys.. ;)\n~\nE\nTerms Meanings 8~\nBB - Bloodbath\nregen - Regeneration\nNo-die - basicly a withstand death in that room only, you regen in your\n         clan house or matook if your a loner/outcast.\n;) - The smile of a big 8 foot wierdoo, thanks blinky ;)\nother slang you find - The pure, unfiltered Newfie language I know an love\n \nIf you find any inprovments, addations, ect.  give me a note/tell!\n \n-Palibar\n~\n#720\nCamorra~\nthe hazy mist~\n~\n~\nportal ORSTY P\n0 0 0 4600 0\n0 100 0 P\n#721\nMatook~\nthe hazy mist~\n~\n~\nportal ORSTY P\n0 0 0 16502 0\n0 100 0 P\n#722\nspring water fountain ~\na fresh spring~\nA fresh spring flows from the ground here.~\nwater~\nfountain ORSTY 0\n100000 100000 'water' 0 0\n0 0 0 P\n#723\nhaste potion~\na haste potion~\nA super improved haste potion made for the BB lies here.~\nSugar~\npotion AFGHPSTUZ A\n54 'haste' '' '' ''\n25 10 3300 P\n#724\nhaggis~\nsome haggis~\nSome haggis is steaming here.~\nentrails~\npill IORSTY AOQ\n5 'cure critical' 'frenzy' 'giant strength' ''\n0 20 1000 P\nE\nhaggis~\nYou look at this meal and don't even know which side is up!

The area is no_die so you will `repop' in your clan hall\n   (Matook for you loners and outcasts) with your equ intact.  A word of\n   advice, relog.  When you die in a no_die area you AC gets a bit screewed\n   up and a simple relog shall fix that.\n2) Outcasts and loners have no fear of being looted at matook.  I give you a\n   2 minute free passage (or 5 ticks, where ever comes first) to get to a\n   safe place and regen.  If someone kills you in that time after getting\n   defeated from my bloodbath you'll get your equ back.  If I find you\n   were abusing this free grace then your phucked.\n3) Once inside the bloodbath you will be put in a small regen room with\n   everybody else.  Talk, brag, trade equ, but if you attack your out.\n   There is -NO- Stealing anywhere in my quests, do so and I'll get ya\n   frozen for a month.  There is in excuse for stealing.  Once I give the\n   word you spell up inside the room and then when everybody is ready I\n   open the door and you leave east then start to kill.\n4) Disarmed weapons will be returned, just keep track who picked it up, I\n   cannot return a weapon if I don't know who has it.\n5) -=NO=- Charmies..  that included skelly warriors, animated corpses, and\n   summoned charmies.  This also includes summoning someone else into\n   the bloodbath that was not a starting member or was previously defeated.\n6) Potions, staves, wands are permitted.  If you happened to toast a person\n   Inside the Bloodbath and get a heart, find me and I'll trade you the heart\n   for a heal potion.\n7) Rewards is a shard for winning and a shard per kill.  You also have the\n   option of asking me to check to see if Puff has a fractial shard on her, if\n   so, it's yours.  Weather she has it or not though, you'll lose all rights to\n   the cash prize.\n8) I cannot remove or give back KILLER or THIEF flags, so don't ask me.\n9) If you happen to have to relog, you can risk it and lose link inside\n   the bloodbath or you can try and find the portal out and leave, your\n   choice, but if you leave you do not get to go back inside.  That's that.\nGood luck and hope you enjoy the Bloodbath!(tm)\n-Pal\n-Soviet\n~\n#726\nTownhomes Homes Houses~\nthe hazy mist~\n~\n~\nportal ORSTY P\n0 0 0 30000 0\n0 100 0 P\n#727\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\na bloodbath portal~\nA shimmering poral to the Bloodbaths.~\nMagic~\nportal AIORSTY APQ\n0 0 0 730 0\n25 10000 1 P\nE\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\nYour see before you a swirling red portal leading to a plane of death\nand sport enjoyed by the gods at the expense of hapless morts.

It'll save me the hassle when I'm\nin the middle of doing something else and somebody asks the well known\nQ: 'What's a BB?' Anyhow, take care an enjoy...\n \n-Pal\n~\nE\nIntro itro 2~\nWelcome to the Bloodbath(tm).  You've decided to read up on some of the\nmore bloodier aspects of the Moosehead Quest system.  The Bloodbath has\nbeen around as long as I have at least, and maybe then some.  It was\norginally created by Johnwa, by request of Nobody.  It was used on and off\nby the two to have scattered quests involving a no-kill area and space\nneeded to run around in while not haveing the quest inturropted.\nSoon after, I immed from Honor, and found that as much of a rush as \nImmhood was, it was damn boaring after the first week. So, while \nexploring the vnums in the mud, I stumbled onto this place.  After getting\nmy good bud Valder to make a portable portal to transport people there, I\nbegan to hold my first BB quests at level 53.  From there it evolved to\nwhere it is today.  \n \nThe Bloodbath, or BB for short, is a killing arena where you and several\nother players get in to butt egos to the death.  The place is No-die\n(which I shall explain later) meaning when you die you shall be regened\nat 1 hp with all your equiment.  It is also No-recall, meaning it's not\neasy wimp out.  Prizes for winning is usually cash with a note following\nsaying you bet the hell outta all who was against you.      -end\n~\nE\nrules 3~\nThe BB is ment to be fun and -relitively- fair.  You are all required to\nhave Nofollow active inside, meaning NO GROUPING PERMITTED.  Next, no\nmobs are permitted to be summoned or corpses reanimated, meaning\nNO CHARMIES PERMITTED.  Breaking of either of these rules will get you\nbooted from the BB at the very least, further punishment pending on the\nmood I'm in if you try and get smart with me.. ;/  But the most \nimportiant and deadly rule, is that there is to be NO STEALING, that\nranges from NO LOOTING, and -=* returning *=- of any picked up equiment.\nThe breaking of this rule will most likly send me off the edge..;p\nIf you want to find out what that will bring ya, well, try it sometime.;)\n \nOh, another rule I was forced to permit was for Loners and Outcasts, which\nis, if a Loner or Outcast was defeated in the BB, he/she/it will have a\n3 minute/5 tick grace, whichever comes first, to get to a safe place.\nIf this is violated from either the attacker, or abused from the \nOutcast or Loner, I won't hestitate get ya frozen.  Please abide by these\nrules, I would REALLY hate to have to imp any of em.  So far, it's been\na clean slate with the writing of this note.   -end\n~\nE\nprizes 4~\nPrizes are, as a rule, something I can make myself, I tried to run these\nquests without higher imm help.  It is usually a jewelled shard for\nwinning, and a shard for each kill you managed to get in that BB.\nOn request, I will check Puff to see if she has a fractical shard and\ngive that out as a prize instead.  As always, if you manage to find a heart\nANY heart and only hearts from a player in the battlefield, I'll give you\na heal potion for it.  Higher prizes MIGHT be included, but don't expect\nem, if there are I'll announce it beforehand.  -end\n~\nE\nloner 5~\nIf you take part in my BB, as a Loner or Outcast, you have my garenteed\nsafty that you'll not be attacked for 3 minutes/5 ticks.  If this is \nabused in ANY fashion, it's void, and your subject to the whimes of who\nis waxing the walls with yer blood.  On request, I'll let you hang in my\nBB startup room tell you get buffed up and ready to go out on your own.\nOh, if you start yelling to those inside, I'll slap a no_channels flag\non ya, I can do that now. ;)  -end\n~\nE\ndisa 6~\nThe BB is garenteed NO_LOOT, if somebody voiloates this, you'll get your\nequiments back and I'll bust em for you.  If either of you try to scam\nme, we'll get the logs checked and the lier will get frozen. ;)  \nFor disarmed weapons, let me know who picked it up, and I'll get it back.\nMost are extreamly honest in this respect, thank gawd. ;p  If you use\nhard to get orginal weapons, highly enchanted, special restrings, ect.\nIt is much easer to track down.  For equiment lost due to lost str, I'll\ndo my best, but you best watch your strength yourself and try not to\nfuck yerself over. ;)    -end\n~\nE\nsrse 7~\nThe Bloodbath(tm) was contributed to by the following people...\n1> Rusty --- Well, it IS his mud.\n2> Johnwa -- Thanks john for letting me have access to the BB vnums.  He \n             made the first BB.\n3> Nobody -- He helped john come up with the idea, and help several BB's \n             himself, he also made the current maze it is today.\n4> Bloodmoon!!! - It was her sadistic bloodthirsty personality that made\n                  me hungry for more BLOOD(baths)...!

The area is no_die so you will `repop' in your clan hall\n   (Matook for you loners and outcasts) with your equ intact.  A word of\n   advice, relog.  When you die in a no_die area you AC gets a bit screewed\n   up and a simple relog shall fix that.\n2) Outcasts and loners have no fear of being looted at matook.  I give you a\n   2 minute free passage (or 5 ticks, where ever comes first) to get to a\n   safe place and regen.  If someone kills you in that time after getting\n   defeated from my bloodbath you'll get your equ back.  If I find you\n   were abusing this free grace then your phucked.\n3) Once inside the bloodbath you will be put in a small regen room with\n   everybody else.  Talk, brag, trade equ, but if you attack your out.\n   There is -NO- Stealing anywhere in my quests, do so and I'll get ya\n   frozen for a month.  There is in excuse for stealing.  Once I give the\n   word you spell up inside the room and then when everybody is ready I\n   open the door and you leave east then start to kill.\n4) Disarmed weapons will be returned, just keep track who picked it up, I\n   cannot return a weapon if I don't know who has it.\n5) -=NO=- Charmies..  that included skelly warriors, animated corpses, and\n   summoned charmies.  This also includes summoning someone else into\n   the bloodbath that was not a starting member or was previously defeated.\n6) Potions, staves, wands are permitted.  If you happened to toast a person\n   Inside the Bloodbath and get a heart, find me and I'll trade you the heart\n   for a heal potion.\n7) Rewards is a shard for winning and a shard per kill.  You also have the\n   option of asking me to check to see if Puff has a fractial shard on her, if\n   so, it's yours.  Weather she has it or not though, you'll lose all rights to\n   the cash prize.\n8) I cannot remove or give back KILLER or THIEF flags, so don't ask me.\n9) If you happen to have to relog, you can risk it and lose link inside\n   the bloodbath or you can try and find the portal out and leave, your\n   choice, but if you leave you do not get to go back inside.  That's that.\nGood luck and hope you enjoy the Bloodbath!(tm)\n-Pal\n-Soviet\n~\n#726\nTownhomes Homes Houses~\nthe hazy mist~\n~\n~\nportal ORSTY P\n0 0 0 30000 0\n0 100 0 P\n#727\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\na bloodbath portal~\nA shimmering poral to the Bloodbaths.~\nMagic~\nportal AIORSTY APQ\n0 0 0 730 0\n25 10000 1 P\nE\nShimmering Bloodbath Portal~\nYour see before you a swirling red portal leading to a plane of death\nand sport enjoyed by the gods at the expense of hapless morts.

You bend closer, and read:\n \n  \"Betrayer and betrayed, I will fight no more,\n   My heart is weary, my soul is lost\n   I grieve for the memory of what is past.\n \n   I will remain, I will survive, for in me\n   the memory lives on.  Betrayer and betrayed,\n   I may wish for the freedom of death, but I will live.\n \n   As long as I remain, the past will be preserved,\n   Ever remembered, never forgotten\n   As long as I am here to defend the memory.\"\n \n~\nE\nalcove statue~\nAs you peer more closely into the alcove, you realize your first\nimpressions were right.  A strangely hideous form is sculpted here,\nout of some blackened and charred substance.  It isn't a skeleton,\nbut a statue... strangely enough, of a dragon.  Its wings are\ntwisted back as though blown by a fierce gale, far more than should\nbe possible, its grim face is contorted by what looks like anger and\npain.  The eyes glower fiercely from below a deep brow, they are\nthe only thing not black, but glitter with a deep, silver light.\n~\nS\n#11054\nA tunnel through the rock~\nA narrow tunnel winds back through the rock, remarkably dry\ngiven the proximity to a large waterfall.  Torches flicker on \nthe walls, casting odd shadows as you move through the rough\npassageway.\n~\n0 D 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 11055\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 11049\nS\n#11055\nEntrance to the City of Thieves~\nThe tunnel widens, and an incredible sight stops you in your\ntracks.  Massive carved gates flank an impossibly huge opening\nin the rock, runes set in silver adorn the walls and floor.  You\ncautiously step around the writings, not knowing what they say,\nhoping that you do not trigger an unknown trap.\n~\n0 D 0\nD1\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 11062\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 11054\nS\n#11056\nThe Lair~\nThe glitter of fine gems and gold attracts your attention almost\nimmediately....almost.  What does attract your immediate attention\nis the rather large dragon curled up in the giant cavern.  Great,\nsad eyes meet yours, eyes that contain the wisdom of ages, and the\nbeast seems to bear some distant resemblance to the statue in the\nouter cave.  Still, you get the feeling it would not be wise to\nremain, it is an unsafe practice to rely on the temperment of a\ndragon to be the same from one moment to the next.\n~\n0 D 5\nD3\nExit

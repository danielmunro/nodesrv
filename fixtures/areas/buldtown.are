The walls are decorated with \nrichly colored frescos, depicting famous battles and events from the \nhistory of Boinga, as well as dragons, griffins and other creatures of \nmany colors.  Hanging on the southern wall is a huge oil painting of two \ndragons, one gold and one silver, their metallic scales shimmering in the \nsunlight.  Two smaller paintings also decorate the same wall.  One of a \nlovely green dragoness, gracefully slaying a wretched creature, perhaps from \nHell itself.  The other depicts the same dragoness, only at a much \nyounger age, who apperes to be trying to teach a small and very cute \ngriffin hatchling to hunt rabbits.  The griffin, however, seems to be \nstalking its tail instead. Although sparsely furnished, the room \ncontains many statues of dragons, griffins and other beasts.  Some carved \nfrom marble, others sculpted from precious metals.  You wonder how the yacht\ncould stay afloat under the weight of such treasures.  On the floor is a \nrichly colored oriental rug, decorated with the long snake-like dragons \nof the like you have never seen before.

The walls are decorated with \nrichly colored frescos, depicting famous battles and events from the \nhistory of Boinga, as well as dragons, griffins and other creatures of \nmany colors.  Hanging on the southern wall is a huge oil painting of two \ndragons, one gold and one silver, their metallic scales shimmering in the \nsunlight.  Two smaller paintings also decorate the same wall.  One of a \nlovely green dragoness, gracefully slaying a wretched creature, perhaps from \nHell itself.  The other depicts the same dragoness, only at a much \nyounger age, who apperes to be trying to teach a small and very cute \ngriffin hatchling to hunt rabbits.  The griffin, however, seems to be \nstalking its tail instead. Although sparsely furnished, the room \ncontains many statues of dragons, griffins and other beasts.  Some carved \nfrom marble, others sculpted from precious metals.  You wonder how the yacht\ncould stay afloat under the weight of such treasures.  On the floor is a \nrichly colored oriental rug, decorated with the long snake-like dragons \nof the like you have never seen before.

The walls are decorated with \nrichly colored frescos, depicting famous battles and events from the \nhistory of Boinga, as well as dragons, griffins and other creatures of \nmany colors.  Hanging on the southern wall is a huge oil painting of two \ndragons, one gold and one silver, their metallic scales shimmering in the \nsunlight.  Two smaller paintings also decorate the same wall.  One of a \nlovely green dragoness, gracefully slaying a wretched creature, perhaps from \nHell itself.  The other depicts the same dragoness, only at a much \nyounger age, who apperes to be trying to teach a small and very cute \ngriffin hatchling to hunt rabbits.  The griffin, however, seems to be \nstalking its tail instead. Although sparsely furnished, the room \ncontains many statues of dragons, griffins and other beasts.  Some carved \nfrom marble, others sculpted from precious metals.  You wonder how the yacht\ncould stay afloat under the weight of such treasures.  On the floor is a \nrichly colored oriental rug, decorated with the long snake-like dragons \nof the like you have never seen before.

The walls are decorated with \nrichly colored frescos, depicting famous battles and events from the \nhistory of Boinga, as well as dragons, griffins and other creatures of \nmany colors.  Hanging on the southern wall is a huge oil painting of two \ndragons, one gold and one silver, their metallic scales shimmering in the \nsunlight.  Two smaller paintings also decorate the same wall.  One of a \nlovely green dragoness, gracefully slaying a wretched creature, perhaps from \nHell itself.  The other depicts the same dragoness, only at a much \nyounger age, who apperes to be trying to teach a small and very cute \ngriffin hatchling to hunt rabbits.  The griffin, however, seems to be \nstalking its tail instead. Although sparsely furnished, the room \ncontains many statues of dragons, griffins and other beasts.  Some carved \nfrom marble, others sculpted from precious metals.  You wonder how the yacht\ncould stay afloat under the weight of such treasures.  On the floor is a \nrichly colored oriental rug, decorated with the long snake-like dragons \nof the like you have never seen before.

Hanging on the southern wall is a huge oil painting of two \ndragons, one gold and one silver, their metallic scales shimmering in the \nsunlight.  Two smaller paintings also decorate the same wall.  One of a \nlovely green dragoness, gracefully slaying a wretched creature, perhaps from \nHell itself.  The other depicts the same dragoness, only at a much \nyounger age, who apperes to be trying to teach a small and very cute \ngriffin hatchling to hunt rabbits.  The griffin, however, seems to be \nstalking its tail instead. Although sparsely furnished, the room \ncontains many statues of dragons, griffins and other beasts.  Some carved \nfrom marble, others sculpted from precious metals.  You wonder how the yacht\ncould stay afloat under the weight of such treasures.  On the floor is a \nrichly colored oriental rug, decorated with the long snake-like dragons \nof the like you have never seen before.

The hideously deformed, and often undead creatures of Hell itself\nstroll in and out of the waygate, and about the room.

The walls are decorated with \nrichly colored frescos, depicting famous battles and events from the \nhistory of Boinga, as well as dragons, griffins and other creatures of \nmany colors.  Hanging on the southern wall is a huge oil painting of two \ndragons, one gold and one silver, their metallic scales shimmering in the \nsunlight.  Two smaller paintings also decorate the same wall.  One of a \nlovely green dragoness, gracefully slaying a wretched creature, perhaps from \nHell itself.  The other depicts the same dragoness, only at a much \nyounger age, who apperes to be trying to teach a small and very cute \ngriffin hatchling to hunt rabbits.  The griffin, however, seems to be \nstalking its tail instead. Although sparsely furnished, the room \ncontains many statues of dragons, griffins and other beasts.  Some carved \nfrom marble, others sculpted from precious metals.  You wonder how the yacht\ncould stay afloat under the weight of such treasures.  On the floor is a \nrichly colored oriental rug, decorated with the long snake-like dragons \nof the like you have never seen before.  The owners of this house \nundoubtly have quite an eye for art, and the pieces have been arranged so \nthat the light from the small round port holes highlight a different\none as the sun moves across the sky.

The walls are decorated with \nrichly colored frescos, depicting famous battles and events from the \nhistory of Boinga, as well as dragons, griffins and other creatures of \nmany colors.  Hanging on the southern wall is a huge oil painting of two \ndragons, one gold and one silver, their metallic scales shimmering in the \nsunlight.  Two smaller paintings also decorate the same wall.  One of a \nlovely green dragoness, gracefully slaying a wretched creature, perhaps from \nHell itself.  The other depicts the same dragoness, only at a much \nyounger age, who apperes to be trying to teach a small and very cute \ngriffin hatchling to hunt rabbits.  The griffin, however, seems to be \nstalking its tail instead. Although sparsely furnished, the room \ncontains many statues of dragons, griffins and other beasts.  Some carved \nfrom marble, others sculpted from precious metals.  You wonder how the yacht\ncould stay afloat under the weight of such treasures.  On the floor is a \nrichly colored oriental rug, decorated with the long snake-like dragons \nof the like you have never seen before.

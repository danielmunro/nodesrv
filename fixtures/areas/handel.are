The space is mind-boggling. One could easily fit as much as five\ntents in this single space. It must have cost extra and gone very quickly for\nthis week. The fire place is expecially large. You could cook a whole meal \nfor Thanksgiving in it. A huge grating sits atop the fire place. You whistle\nin appreciation for this amazing site. Oddly, the grilling on the fire shakes\na bit for a while as if the sound from your whistle was amplified through it.\nThis site wasn't opened to stay in or else the park ranger at the entrance\nwould have mentioned it. Strangely, it looks quite abandoned and barren. You\nwish you could put it to good use. When you're done revelling in its splendor\nyou can return to the west and continue searching.\n~\n0 0 3\nD3\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 1971\nD5\nExit ~\ngrilling~\n16487 1906 1974\nE\ngrilling~\nThe grilling looks very loose over this fireplace.

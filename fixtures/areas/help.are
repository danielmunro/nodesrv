All you\nneed to do, is:\n1.  Announce intent with the support of 1 /4.  (If you are\na /4, thats fine, support of any other member is acceptable.\n2.  A vote will be held, winner takes all.  If there is a tie\nthen it is settled by dual.\n3.  Anyone guilded within 2 weeks of the Mutiny is NOT permitted\na vote.\n4.  The loser will be required to leave all EQ behind.  This is\nso the leader (Whom may be holding clan funds) doesn't make\nit out the door and screw the clan.  It will be up to the\nwinner to return any other gear.  (which would follow charter)\n\nDEMISE:\n\nTo mutiny in Demise, you need to have five supporters who\nare different characters, and you must organize the mutiny\nin seret, posting the mutiny note to Demise and the immortals\nonce the supporters, one of which must be a /4, have been\narranged.  Otherwise, the current leader is entitled to \noutcast you at any time prior to the public posting.\nIn addition, you yourself must have been in Demise for\na period of two months, not necessairly consecutive months\nprovided you didn't join any other clan if you were a loner\nat some point.  Once these requirements have been satisified,\na duel will take place in which each side may declare a champion\nto fight in their place.  The winning side becomes the leader.\n\nHONOR:\n\nAny Mutineer must have attained the rank of /2 or above and have at\nleast 5 supporters, those of rank /3 only require 4 supporers, and\nthose of rank /4 only require 3 supporters. He must then post a note \ndeclaring the mutiny that includes character info, mutiny reasons and \nthe names of his supporters.  If this is done, and the supporters are \nverified,1 week of voting will commence. An immortal will count the \nvotes. No recruiting will take place during the week of voting.  Voting \nwith alts will disqualify a person's votes.  The mutineer and /5's may \nnot vote.The loser of the mutiny will be ranked /1 and will hand over all\nvaluables to the victor.\n\nPOSSE:\n\nIf you wish to challenge for leadership, it works as a simple\nmajority vote. In order to be elligible you must first gain \nsupport from at least 3 other posse members.Once you have \nnecessary support, the election begins. Majority wins.\nThe parties involved (being the Leader challenged and the \nchallenger) can not vote.\n\nWARLOCK:\n\nMajority Vote was method used in past, so as it stands that \nis the policy. An Imm would be asked to tally votes.\nMutineer would post cnote to 'Warlock Immortal' declaring mutiny\nand giving name of IMM to post your vote to.\n(so votes can be anonymous) 7 days from post date, vote is tallied, \nwinner is /5 looser is outcast.\n\nZEALOT:\n\nTo mutiny in Zealot, the mutineer must be a rank /4, and have the\nsupport of at least 5 other members who have been ranked above /0\nand who have been in the clan for at least one month's time.\nThe Anointed then has the choice to either settle the dispute\nvia a duel, or a clan vote.\nIf a duel is called for, an IMM will supervise on a preset date which\nwill be at least one week after the mutiny was called. The duel will\nbe to the death, with no charmies. Cheaters will lose automatically.\nIf the Anointed does not wish to duel, he or she may call for a\nclan vote, which shall last for a period of one week. During that\ntime, all /4s shall be reduced to /0 until the vote is decided, or\none of the contesting parties withdraws.\n\nThe loser of either contest will be at the winner's discretion.\n\n~\n\n\n-1 hlab~\n\nThe Infamous Prefresh\n\nQ. What is it?\nA. The prefresh is short for \"player refresh\".  It is a process by which all\ncurrent player files (the file that contains the data about your character in\nfixed storage) and updated to the current MHS game code.\n\nQ. How often will we do this?\nA. If we do it right and make changes correectly, once and once only.\n\nQ. How will I know when I am being prefreshed?\nA. You will be given a 10-day advanced warning before we do it.  We will also\nrun a handful of tests that players can volunteer to put themselves through\nto make sure there are no bugs.\n\nQ. What will happen to my character when I prefresh?\nA. When the day arrives you will log in and the game will detect that your\ncharacter is not marked as being prefreshed already.  You'll be put into a\nsort of secondary creation mode.  You will be told that you need to prefresh\nand an image of your player file will be backed up to a special directory just\nin case something goes wrong.  The game will store in a special data structure\na copy of your important data, and then you'll have to select which method of\nprefresh you want to use.  You'll be guided through the process from there.\n\nQ. What are my options?\nA. Option #1 is the Standard Prefresh.  What happens is that your character\nis set to level 1 and you go to the alignment selection screen.  You pick your\nalignment, and then you to the stat customization screen.  Once that is done,\nyou are put back into the game at level 1, and your skills will all default\nback to their original values.  When you type \"score\", you'll see that you\nhave an item called \"debit levels\".  You may use these at any time to level.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 DIKU~\n.

Gold coins are worth\n100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as \nopposed to 100 to the pound for silver).  For your sledding convenience, a\nmoney changer can be found in northern Midgaard on clan road, he charges a\n5% fee for his services.  Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems\nfrom the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.\n10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for\nthe highest quality stones.\n~\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n \n\n0 BRIEF COMPACT~\n\nBrief and compact help set your display options for the game. \n\nTyping brief without any arguments toggles combat failed attack messages..\nBrief can also be used with the following options:\n\n  room           - toggles long room descriptions\n  longeq         - displays full equipment slot list\n  wholist        - short version of the wholist (IMM only)\n  combat         - supress failed attack messages \n  chardesc       - toggles character descriptions\n  surname\t - show surnames in the who list\n  titles\t - show player titles in the who list\n\nCompact toggles the presence/absence of the blank line before your prompt.\n~\n\n-1 DEAF~\nThe deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded\nby messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to\nreply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you\ncannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly \nuseful for sending a quick \"I'm being spammed so I went deaf\" message to\na person).\n~\n\n-1 AFK~\nTyping AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell\nto you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing\nrecall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,\nbut don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is\nturned off.\n\nTells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be\nseen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before\nreading them).\n~\n\n-1 PROMPT~\nSyntax: prompt\nSyntax: prompt all\nSyntax: prompt <%*>\n \nPROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.\n \nPROMPT ALL will give you the standard \"<hits mana moves>\" prompt.\n \nPROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.\n \n        %h :  Display your current hits\n        %H :  Display your maximum hits\n        %m :  Display your current mana\n        %M :  Display your maximum mana\n        %v :  Display your current moves\n        %V :  Display your maximum moves\n        %x :  Display your current experience\n\t%X :  Display experience to level\n        %g :  Display your gold held\n\t%s :  Display silver carried\n\t%S :  Display sac points\n        %a :  Display your alignment\n        %n :  Display the number of items you are carrying\n        %N :  Display the MAX number of items you can carry\n        %w :  Display your current carried weight\n        %W :  Display your MAX carry weight\n        %r :  Display the room name you are in\n\t%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style\n\t%b :  Display a bar-graph of your hit points\n\t%B :  Display a bar-graph of your mana points\n\t%t :  Display in-game hour of the day\n\t%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)\n        %R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)\n        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)\n\t%i :  Display incognito (IMMORTAL ONLY)\n\t%y :  Display wizi (IMMORTAL ONLY)\n \nExample:  PROMPT <%hhp %mm %vmv>\n        Will set your prompt to \"<10hp 100m 100mv>\"\n \n~\n-1 SUMMARY~\nMOVEMENT                            GROUP\nnorth south east west up down       follow group gtell split\nexits recall\nsleep wake rest stand\n\nOBJECTS                             INFORMATION / COMMUNICATION\nget put drop give sacrifice         help credits commands areas\nwear wield hold                     report score time weather where who\nrecite quaff zap brandish           description password title\nlock unlock open close pick         bug idea typo\ninventory equipment look compare    gossip cgossip say shout tell yell\neat drink fill                      emote pose\nlist buy sell value                 note\n\nCOMBAT                              OTHER\nkill flee kick rescue disarm        ! save quit\nbackstab cast wimpy                 practice train\n\n\nFor more help, type 'help <topic>' for any command, skill, or spell.\n\nFor a complete list of help topics, 'help topics'.\n~\n\n\n\n0 DAMAGE~\nWhen one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the\nverb used in the damage message.

( < 10%   )\n~\n\n0 DEATH~\nWhen your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple\nof Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,\ntogether with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you (IMMs want \nyou to have your gold).\n\nAny spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.\n\nFollowing and groups are not affected by death.\n\nYou lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of \nthe way back to the beginning of your level.\n\nCorpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.\nPlayer corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).\nOnly the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects\nfrom a player's corpse, unless that person who died was clanned, in which case\ntheir corpse is free for the looting by another clanned player.\n\n~\n\n\n\n0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~\nYour character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set \namount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.\n\nYou gain experience by:\n    \n    killing a player or creature\n    being part of a group that kills a monster\n    participating in a quest that gives experience as a reward\n\nYou lose experience by:\n\n    fleeing from combat\n    recalling out of combat\n    being the target of certain spells\n    dying\n\nThe experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players\nare in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment\nversus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed\nlately; and some random variation.\n~\n\n\n\n0 PET PETS~\nYou can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after \nthe old one dies you may purchase a replacement.  \n\nbuy <pet type> <name>\n\n~\n\n\n\n0 TICK~\nMany of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,\nmost autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,\nweather, and area resetting.\n\nOf these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the\n'tick'.  Ticks on this sled average 45 seconds of real time, but the actual\namount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.\n\nArea resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less\noften (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground\nwill not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.\n~\n\n\n\n0 !~\nSyntax: !\n\n! repeats the last command you typed.\n~\n\n0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~\nSyntax: north\nSyntax: south\nSyntax: east\nSyntax: west\nSyntax: up\nSyntax: down\n\nUse these commands to walk in a particular direction.\n~\n\n0 CAST~\nSyntax: cast <spell> <target>\n\nBefore you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,\nthe higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.\nThe mana cost decreases as your level increases.\n\nThe <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an\nappropriate default target, especially during combat.\n\nIf the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.\nExample: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.\nYou can abbreviate the spell name.\n\nWhen you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.\nThe effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the\nsaving throw successfully.\n\nSee also the help sections for individual spells.\n~\n\n0 EXITS~\nSyntax: exits\n\nTells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.\nYou can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a\ncertain direction and see what you bump into).\n~\n\n0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~\nSyntax: drop <object>\nSyntax: drop <amount> coins\nSyntax: get  <object>\nSyntax: get  <object> <container>\nSyntax: give <object> <character>\nSyntax: give <amount> coins <character>\nSyntax: put  <object> <container>\n\nDROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.\n\nGET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even\nfrom a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.\n\nGIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.\n\nPUT puts an object into a container.\n\nDROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and\n'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.\n~\n\n0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~\nSyntax: equipment\nSyntax: inventory\n\nEQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).\nINVENTORY lists your inventory.\n~\n\n0 COMPARE~\nSyntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>\nSyntax: compare <object>\n \nCOMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,\nit will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are\narmor, it will report the one with the better armor class.\n \nCOMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object\nyou are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.\n \nCOMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.\n~\n\n0 FLEE~\nSyntax: flee\nSyntax: rescue   <character>\n\nOnce you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight\nis not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can\nRESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,\nand costs more experience points, then fleeing).\n\nIf you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep\nfighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances\nof making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.\n~\n\n0 EXAMINE LOOK~\nSyntax: look\nSyntax: look    <object>\nSyntax: look    <character>\nSyntax: look    <direction>\nSyntax: look    <keyword>\nSyntax: look in <container>\nSyntax: look in <corpse>\nSyntax: examine <container>\nSyntax: examine <corpse>\n\nLOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.\n\nEXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.\n~\n\n0 ORDER~\nSyntax: order <character> command\nSyntax: order all command\n\nORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to\nperform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible\nfor the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers\nwill incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.\n\nMost charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).\n\nIf your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.\n~\n\n0 SLEEP~\nSyntax: cast 'sleep' <victim>\n\nThis spell puts its victim to sleep.\n~\n\n0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~\nSyntax: rest\nSyntax: sleep\nSyntax: stand\nSyntax: wake\n\nThese commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you \nregenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.\nHowever, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,\nyou won't hear many things happen.\n\nUse STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can\nalso WAKE other sleeping characters.\n~\n\n0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~\nSyntax: gtell <message>\nSyntax: say   <message>\nSyntax: tell  <character> <message>\n\nAll of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to\nall of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are\nsleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.\n\nSAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''\nis a synonym for SAY.\n\nTELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.\n\nREPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work\neven if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This\nis handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.\n~\n-1 SLED~\nA SLED is a Slightly Liquid Earthy Dementia.\n~\n\n-1 NOTE NOTES SPOOL BUG CHANGE NEWS INOTE ONOTE CNOTE GNOTE IDEA QNOTE~\nThe notes on MHS replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many\nother sleds.  There are several types of notes including In-Character notes \n(inotes), Out-of-Character Notes(onotes), Bug Notes (bug), Quest Notes (qnotes) \nand God Notes (gnote). \nThe following options are usable(in this case, an inote is used as an example, for other types of notes, simply replace inote with the appropriate type of note):\n\nreading notes:\ninote list\t: show all inotes (unread notes are marked with an N)\ninote read\t: either by number, or read next to read unread inotes\ninote remove\t: removes an inote that you wrote or are the target of\ninote catchup\t: markes all inotes as read\nspool           : Catches up all notes of all types\nunread          : Lists notes that have not been read by this character\n\nwriting new notes:\ninote to\t: sets the to line (name, clanname, 'clans', immortal, or all)\ninote subject\t: sets the subject for a new inote\ninote +\t\t: adds a line to a new inote (i.e. inote + hi guys!)\ninote -\t\t: remove a line from an inote in progress\ninote clear\t: erase an inote in progress\nnote show\t: shows the inote you are working on\ninote post\t: posts a new inote. This MUST be done to post an inote.\n\nWhen you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type\nnote read to scroll through them one at a time.\n\nFour other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, and \npenalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example\nidea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards is\nrestricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on\nall the note spools.\n\n~\n0 GOSSIP CGOSSIP . SHOUT YELL~\nSyntax: gossip  <message>\nSyntax: cgossip <message>\nSyntax: yell    <message>\n\nGOSSIP and CGOSSIP send messages to all plays who are listening to the \nchannel.  The '.' is a shortened version of the GOSSIP command. \n\nYELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.\n\nType a channel name by itself to turn it off.\n~\n\n0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~\nSyntax: emote <action>\nSyntax: pose\n\nEMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are\nseveral dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK\n(type socials or help socials for a listing).\n\nPMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's\nname (i.e. pmote bonks Rusty will be read as bonks you by Rusty, and as \nbonks Rusty by everyone else).\n\nPOSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.\n~\n\n52 SMOTE~\nSyntax: smote <action>\n\nSmote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in\nthe string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.\n~\n\n0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~\nSyntax: hold   <object>\nSyntax: remove <object>\nSyntax: wear   <object>\nSyntax: wear   all\nSyntax: wield  <object>\n\nThree of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using\nit as equipment.

WIELD is for weapons.\n\nWEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your\ninventory.\n\nYou may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not\nmatch yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough\nto use it properly.\n\nREMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your\ninventory.\n~\n\n\n0 BUG TYPO~\nSyntax: bug <message>\nSyntax: idea <message>\nSyntax: typo <message>\n\nThese commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback\nto the sled implementors.\n~\n\n0 CREDITS~\nSyntax: credits\n\nThis command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors.\n~\n\n0 AREAS COMMANDS REPORT SCORE TIME~\nSyntax: areas\nSyntax: commands\nSyntax: report\nSyntax: score\nSyntax: time\nSyntax: weather\n\nAREAS shows you a list of areas in the game.\n\nCOMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game.\n\nREPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other\nplayers in the room.  SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.\nYour ability scores are shown as true value(current value), so for example\nStr: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength\nfrom other factors (spells or items).\n\nTIME shows the game time, as well as the time the sled was last started,\nand the current local time for the host computer.\n\nWEATHER shows the current game weather.\n~\n\n-1 WHO~\nSyntax: who\nSyntax: who <level-range>\nSyntax: who <class or race>\nSyntax: who <clan or nonclan>\nSyntax: who <clan name>\nSyntax: who <class or race> <level-range> <clan name>\n\nWHO shows the people currently in the game.  Some people may choose to\nremain unseen and won't appear on the WHO\n \nWHO without any arguments shows all of the (visible) people currently playing.\n\nWith arguments, WHO can show players of certain classes or levels.\nFor example:\n \nwho 10          lists all players of level 10 or above\nwho 15 20       lists all players between level 15 and 20\nwho cleric      lists all clerics playing\nwho immortal    lists all immortals playing\nwho cleric 1 5  lists all clerics between levels 1 and 5\nwho elf cleric  lists all elven clerics\nwho demise e m  lists all elven mages in Demise \nwho clan        lists all the clanners\nwho nonclan     lists all the nonclanners\n\nClasses and races may be abbreviated.\n~\n\n-1 WHOIS~\nSyntax: whois <name>\nThe whois command identifies any user who matches the name given. For\nexample, 'whois a' shows all characters whose name begins with A.\n~\n\n0 WHERE SCAN~\nSyntax: scan\nSyntax: where\nSyntax: scan <character>\nSyntax: where <character>\n\nWHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same\narea as you are.\n\nWHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name\nwithin your area, including monsters.\n\nSCAN is a synonym for WHERE.\n~\n\n0 HELP~\nSyntax: help\nSyntax: help <keyword>\n\nHELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.\n\nHELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include\nall the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.\n~\n\n0 DESCRIPTION DESC~\nSyntax: description <string>\nSyntax: description + <string>\nSyntax: description - \n\nSets your long description to the given string.  If the description string\nstarts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current\ndescription, so that you can make multi-line descriptions. You can delete\nlines by uses description -.\n~\n\n0 PASSWORD~\nSyntax: password <old-password> <new-password>\n\nPASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be\nyour old password.  The second argument is your new password.\n\nThe PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.\n~\n\n0 TITLE~\nSyntax: title <string>\n\nSets your title to a given string.\n\nThe game supplies a title when your character is created.  Note that if\nyou include color codes, your title will be artificially shortened.\n~\n\n0 WIMPY~\nSyntax: wimpy\nSyntax: wimpy <number>\n\nWIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces\nyour hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.\nYou will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not\nbeen using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been\ntripped or bash by an enemy.\n\nWIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.\n\nSome monsters are wimpy.\n~\n\n0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~\nSyntax: open   <object|direction>\nSyntax: close  <object|direction>\nSyntax: lock   <object|direction>\nSyntax: unlock <object|direction>\nSyntax: pick   <object|direction>\n\nOPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.\n\nLOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have\nthe requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.\n\nPICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,\nyou must practice the appropriate skill.\n~\n\n0 DRINK EAT FILL POUR~\nSyntax: drink <object>\nSyntax: eat   <object>\nSyntax: fill  <object> <fountain>\nSyntax: pour  <object> out\nSyntax: pour  <object> <object>\nSyntax: pour  <object> <character>\n\nWhen you are thirsty, DRINK something.\n\nWhen you are hungry, EAT something.\n\nFILL fills a drink container with liquid from a fountain.\n\nPOUR transfers a liquid to a container, or empties one.\nYou can also pour from an object into something a character is holding.\n~\n\n0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~\nSyntax: buy   <object>\nSyntax: list\nSyntax: sell  <object>\nSyntax: value <object>\n\nBUY buys an object from a shop keeper.\nWhen multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n\nis the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two\nswords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of\nan item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into\n(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  \n\nBe careful!  Type carefully when buyign things.  If the shopkeeper thinks\nyou are trying to cheat him out of his wares by feeding him weird information,\nhe'll confiscate all your money.  Know the 'buy' command inside and out.\n\nLIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.\nList <name> shows you only objects of that name.\n\nSELL sells an object to a shop keeper.\n\nVALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.\n~\n\n0 SACRIFICE~\nSyntax: sacrifice <object>\n\nSACRIFICE offers an object to your deity, who may reward you.\nThe nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.\n~\n\n0 SCROLL~\nSyntax: scroll\nSyntax: scroll <number>\n\nThis command changes the number of lines the sled sends you in a page (the \ndefault is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen\nsizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.\n~\n\n0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~\nSyntax: brandish\nSyntax: quaff    <potion>\nSyntax: recite   <scroll> <target>\nSyntax: zap      <target>\nSyntax: zap\n\nBRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed\nto DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the\n<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a\nmagical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting\nsomeone, then that character is used for a target.\n\nYou must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.\n\nAll of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single\ncharge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no\nmore charges, it will be consumed.\n\nThese commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries\non the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.\n~\n\n0 CONSIDER~\nSyntax: consider <character>\n\nCONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.\nOf course, it's only a rough estimate.\n~\n\n0 FOLLOW GROUP~\nSyntax: follow <character>\nSyntax: group\nSyntax: group <character>\n\nFOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,\njust FOLLOW <yourself>.\n\nGROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.\nGroup members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and\nSPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically\njoin the fight.\n\nIf the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will\nkick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your\ngroup by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.\n\nGROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.\n\nYou may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of\nyour own.\n~\n\n0 VISIBLE~\nVISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,\nmaking you visible again.\n~\n\n0 QUIT RENT SAVE~\nSyntax: QUIT\nSyntax: RENT ... not!\nSyntax: SAVE\n\nSAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every\n15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save\nwill block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.\n(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)\n\nSome objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.\n\nQUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game \nyou will be back in the same room.\n\nQUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one\ncommand.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into\nthe habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other sled that\ndoesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.\n\nThere is no RENT in this sled.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.\n~\n\n0 RECALL /~\nSyntax: RECALL\n\nRECALL prays to your deity for miraculous transportation from where you are\nback to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.\n\nIf you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),\nand you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This\nchance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not \ninsure success.\n\nRECALL costs half of your movement points.\n\nRECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a\ncurse may not recall at all.\n~\n\n-1 SPLIT~\nSyntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>\n\nSPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your\ngroup who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT\nthe loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver\nthe split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).\nExamples:\nsplit 30 \t--> split 30 silver\nsplit 20 50\t--> split 20 silver, 50 gold\nsplit  0 10\t--> split 10 gold\n~\n\n-1 SNATCH~\nSyntax:  SNATCH <floating object> <character>\n\nSNATCH attempts to steal a character or mobs floating object.\nOnly those in the clan system may steal from other characters.\nIf you are caught snatching from another character, you will receive the\nTHIEF flag.  If you are caught snatching from a mob, they will attack\nyou.\n~\n-1 STEAL~\nSyntax: STEAL coins <character>\nSyntax: STEAL <object> <character>\n\nSTEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character or mob.\nObjects must be in the inventory of the target, you are not able to\nsteal items they are wearing (no one is that good).  Only those in the\nclan system may steal from other characters.\nIf you are caught stealing from another character, you will receive the\nTHIEF flag.  If you are caught stealing from a mob, they will attack\nyou.\n\n~\n\n0 PRACTICE~\nSyntax: PRACTICE\nSyntax: PRACTICE <-new|-skill|-spell|-old|-skip> <skill/spell name>\n\nPRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all\nthe skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.\n\nPRACTICE with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell. \nYour learning percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a maximum of 100%\nYou must be at a guild master to practice.\n\nPRACTICE -new will display your skills/spells less then 75%.\n\nPRACTICE -skills will display only your skills.\n\nPRACTICE -spells will display only your spells.\n\nPRACTICE -old with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up\nto your old skill % prior to Pfresh for a cost of 1 practice. If you are\nnot a pfresh character then this option is not useable.\n\nPRACTICE -skip with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up\nregularly, ignoring any old skill % prior to Pfresh.\n\nThe higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice\nsession.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will\nhave each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you\ndo use them.\n~\n\n0 TRAIN~\nSyntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana moves>\n\nTRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your\ncharacter has standard attributes based on your class, and several\ninitial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by\nusing these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).\n\nIt takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase\nmoves,mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.\n\nThe best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more\npractice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.\nIn the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train\nWIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.\n~\n57 FUCK~\nSyntax: fuck <character>\n\nFUCK is used on the more annoying players, and those that are spamming\nincessently.  The technicalities of the command will be spared, but it\ndoes basically what it says.  It is similar to the DISCONNECT command,\nbut has it's special twist.  Use this command to bide time or annoy an\nannoying user.  It should, in most cases, take them a bit to relog.\n~\n\n59 ADVANCE~\nSyntax: advance <character> <level>\n\nADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the\nonly way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE\nmay also be used to demote characters.\n~\n\n60 TRUST~\nSyntax: trust <character> <level>\n\nTRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to\nadvancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect\non combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or\nimmortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up\nthe character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their\nnatural level.\n\nA trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.\n~\n\n57 DNS UNDNS~\nSyntax: dns <IP or IP block>\n        undns <listed IP or IP block>\n\tdns\n\nDNS <IP or IP block> adds to a linked list of strings that are\nchecked against the IP of an incoming socket to see if it should\nbe looked up for an IP to name record (PTR).  The check uses a\nstr_prefix() comparison so partial blocks will work as well\nas full dotted quad IP's.\n\nRunning the command with no arguments shows the current list.\nThe 'undns' command removes the exact matching string from the list.\n\nTypos containing non-IP strings simply get skipped since they never\nmatch an IP or block.  But, typos should be removed.\n~\n\n58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~\nSyntax: allow   <site>\n\tban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>\n\tban\n\nBAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with\nno arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from\nthe ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.\n\nA site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set\nby editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.\n*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or \ncontent (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many\nsites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.\n~\n\n59 EQLIST~\nSyntax: eqlist <all|armor|weapons>\n\nEQLIST generates a flat file in /mud/moosehead/src called eqlist.eql (all),\narmor.eql (armor) or weapons.eql (weapons). The file contains a listing of\nthe equipment in a designated way for a PERL Script to parse into an online\nequipment list.\n~\n\n59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~\nSyntax: reboot\n\tshutdown\n\nReboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used\nto control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow\nold connections to die), followed by a reboot.\n\nShutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script\nfrom restarting it.\n\nNever, ever, shutdown the sled without consulting Rusty.\n~\n\n\n56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~\nSyntax: wizlock\n\tnewlock\n\nWizlock and newlock both block login attempts to MooseHead Sled. Wizlock locks\nout all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who\nare returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically\nused for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,\nand newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to Rusty and Creators.\n\nA god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.\n~\n\n59 DENY~\nSyntax: deny <name>\n\nDeny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character\nname unusable.  It may only be removed by having a 59 pload the character, so\nfreeze is usually preferred.\n~\n\n57 DISCONNECT~\nSyntax: disconnect <name>\n\nDisconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet\nprompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying\nplayers.\n~\n\n57 FREEZE~\nSyntax: freeze <name>\n\nFREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any\ncommands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a \ntroublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.\n~\n\n55 CTALK~\nSyntax: ctalk <clan> <message>\n\nCtalk lets an immortal speak on a clan channel without the need\nto guild themself into and out of the clan in question.  It also\nautomatically turns on LISTEN if it's off, so that you will hear\nany responses to your message.\n\nSEE ALSO:  listen\n~\n\n55 LISTEN~\nsyntax: listen\n\nListen is a toggle that allows you to turn on or off the ability\nto listen in on clan channels.  If on, any communication done over\na clan channel is also printed out to you, along with a header\ndenoting the clan channel it came across.\n~\n\n53 FORCE~\nSyntax: force <character> <command>\nSyntax: force all <command>\n\nFORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.\n\nBelow level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is\nunavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. \n\nFORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.\nThis is typically used for 'force all save'.\n~\n\n57 FUCK~\n'Fuck' is a command that starts a Zmodem download on that players side,\nthereby dumping him/her, and basically 'fuck'ing up their connection and\nterminal.  Sometimes, it will have devestating affects, sometimes, it will\nonly be as good as a 'disconnect'.\n~\n\n56 SOCKETS~\nSyntax: sockets\n\tsockets <name> \n\nSOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including \nusers in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the \nchannel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in \nmerc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.\n\nThe optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used\nto identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched\ninto an orc).\n~\n58 HOSTMASK~\nSyntax: hostmask <password> <string> <character>\n\nNOTE:  THE CHARACTER YOU ARE HOSTMASKING *MUST* BE CONNECTED!!!\n       If you try to hostmask a ploaded or link dead character\n       you WILL crash the game.\n\nHostmask allows you to mask the ip address of the socket you are coming \nin on.  This can be usefull if you do not want others to know who your \nmorts are.\n\n~\n56 LOAD~\nSyntax: load mob <vnum>\n\tload obj <vnum> <level>\n\nThe load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to \nduplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum\ncommand, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.\n\nLoad puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are\nput in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old\nformat objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new\nformat objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.\n(see also clone, vnum, stat)\n~\n55 FLAG~\nFLAG is used to set mob and character flags\nSyntax:\nflag mob  <name> <field> <flags>\n     mob  flags: act,aff,off,imm,res,vuln,form,part\n\nflag char <name> <field> <flags>\n     char flags: plr,comm,aff,imm,res,vuln,mhs\n\n+: add flag, -: remove flag, = set equal to otherwise flag toggles the flags\nlisted.\n\nPlayer Flags ( plr )\nnpc           autoassist     autoexit        autoloot,\nautosac       autogold       autosplit       honor\ncircle        demise         balance         loner\nholylight     can_loot       nosummon        nofollow\npermit        dweeb          log             deny\nfreeze        thief          killer\n\nCommunication flags ( comm )\nquiet         deaf           nowiz           noclangossip\nnogossip      noooc          noquestion      nomusic\nnoclan        noquest        nograts         noemote\nnoshout       noshout        notell          nochannels\nnonotes       snoop_proof    afk\n\nAffect Flags ( aff )\nTo add a flag:    flag char <name> plr +: <flag> \nTo remove a flag: flag char <name> plr -: <flag> \nblind         invisible      detect_evil     detect_invis\ndetect_magic  detect_hidden  detect_good     sanctuary\nfaerie_fire   infrared       curse           poison\nprotect_evil  protect_good   sneak           hide\nsleep         charm          flying          pass_door\nhaste         calm\n\nImmunityFlags ( imm ) ResistanceFlags (res) VulnFlags (vuln)\nThese flags are all used to set immunities, resistances and \nvulns.\nsummon        charm          magic           weapon\nbash          pierce         slash           fire\ncold          lightning      acid            poison\nnegative      holy           energy          mental\ndisease       drowning       light           sound\nwood          silver         iron      \n~\n\n58 SET~\nSyntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>\n\tset obj   <object> <field> <value>\n\tset room  <number> <field> <value>\n\tset skill <char>   <name>  <rating>\n\tset skill <char>   all     <rating>\n\nThe set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data\nstructures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.\nSet skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value\ngiven.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.\n(see also string, stat)\n~\n\n55 STRING~\nSyntax: string obj <field> <string>\n\tstring mob <field> <string>\n\nThe string command changes the various strings associated with an object or\nmobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string\nmob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.\nWhen doing a restring here are some rules:\n*You may not restring an item so that it's name, short, or long\nmatch an existing item in the game.  Always vnum what they are\nasking for to see if it is an item in the game.\n\nExample of  Bad Restrings:\nan assassin's quiver restrung to a pair of black dragon scale leggings\na portable hole restrung to a gnomish sword\n\nExample of Ok Restrings:\nan assassin's quiver restrung to a dragon scale pouch\na portable hole restrung to a vat of gumbo\n\nThe assassin's quiver is a container, a dragon scale pouch leads \npeople to believe it is a container.  Hence, that would be an ok\nrestring.\n*All words in the name must appear in the short and long descriptions\n\nGenerally, morts will say \"i want this to be called joes big gun\"\nIt is up to you to make sure that \"joes big gun\" appears in the short\nand long description.\n\nExample of a Bad Restring:\nOrigional Item:  rangers backpack\nNew Name:        my secret hidey hole bag\nNew Short:       rangers backpack\nNew Long:        A rangers backpack lies here.\n\nThe above would be a very very very bad restring.  \n\nExample of a Good Restring:\nOrigional Item:  rangers backpack\nwhat the mort wants:  my secret hidey hole bag\nNew Name:        my secret hidey hole bag his\nNew Short:       his serect hidey hole bag\nNew Long:        My secret hidey hole bag lies here.\n\nThe short is different so it looks \"cool\" when they take things\nout of the bag they say.  So, it is up to you to make sure that\n\"my\" appears in the name of the item.\n----------\n*Always get permission before putting other people's names in \na restring.\n\nIf you have any questions about this, please ask an admin\n\n~\n\n55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~\nSyntax: nochannel <character>\n\tnoemote   <character>\n\tnoshout   <character>\n\tnotell    <character>\n\nNoemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by\npreventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.\nCharacters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those\nforms of communication.\n\nThe nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim\nfrom using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.\nNochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.\n~\n\n57 PARDON~\nSyntax: pardon <character> killer\n\tpardon <character> thief\n\nPardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you\nare sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic\npardon.\n~\n\n56 PURGE~\nSyntax: purge\n\tpurge <character>\n\nPurge is used to clean up the world.

You will be asked to provide the short\ndescription and long description (and in some cases the keywords, or name)\nof the item. The keywords you choose must be in both the long and short\ndescriptions you provide.\n\nA short description is what you see when and item is in a shop, being worn,\nor in your inventory.  A long description is what you see when an item is\neither examined/looked at, or on the ground.\n\nFor example:\nshort description: a sub issue shield\nlong description: You see a sub issue shield here.\nkeywors: sub issue shield   \n\n\n1)    The keywords you choose *MUST* exist in both the long and short\n      descriptions.  If there is more than one key, you may have one\n      key in the short description, and a different one in the long\n      description, so long both long and short have a keyword in them.\n\n2)    Several different objects may not be restrung with the exact same\n      name.  This means at the same time or over time.  Objects found to\n      be intentionally restrung with duplicate names will be confiscated.\n\n3)    You may not include the name of another character in the restring\n      of an item without the express consent of that character.\n\n4)    Containers must be restrung to something that resembles a container\n      in some fashion.  Be creative, but no restringing \"a bag\" into \"a\n      shoe\".\n\n5)    There is no discount for multiple restrings at the same time.  The\n      pricing listed above is very reasonable. \n\nWhen an Immortal does a restring for you it is polite to pay attention to\nwhat they are saying and it is always a good idea to know what you want\nbefore you ask for a restring (unless you have prior arrangements with that\nimmortal), to avoid causing an Immortal unnecessary trouble.  If you follow\nthe directions given above your experiences with recieving restrings should\nbe wonderful, memorable experiences.\n~\n52 STARTGLAD~\nStartglad is used to start Gladiator events.\nSyntax:\nstartglad <type> <min level> <max level> <ticks till start> <blind/noblind> <ticks till end>\n\nType has to be one of the following:\n     1 - Singles Event\n     2 - Random Teams Event  \n     3 - Assigned Teams Event \n\nLevels have to be between one and sixty.\nTicks till start has to be at least three.\nBlind will hide the names of the other gladiators.\nNoblind will show the gladiators thier opponents Names.\n~\n52 ENDGLAD~\nEndglad is used to end Gladiator events.\nSyntax:\nendglad <victor's name/none>\n\nYou may have the victor of the event announed by passing it to endglad\nor you may say none if no one won.\n~\n52 REMOVEGLAD~\nRemoveglad is used to remove a player from the event.

All you\nneed to do, is:\n1.  Announce intent with the support of 1 /4.  (If you are\na /4, thats fine, support of any other member is acceptable.\n2.  A vote will be held, winner takes all.  If there is a tie\nthen it is settled by dual.\n3.  Anyone guilded within 2 weeks of the Mutiny is NOT permitted\na vote.\n4.  The loser will be required to leave all EQ behind.  This is\nso the leader (Whom may be holding clan funds) doesn't make\nit out the door and screw the clan.  It will be up to the\nwinner to return any other gear.  (which would follow charter)\n\nDEMISE:\n\nTo mutiny in Demise, you need to have five supporters who\nare different characters, and you must organize the mutiny\nin seret, posting the mutiny note to Demise and the immortals\nonce the supporters, one of which must be a /4, have been\narranged.  Otherwise, the current leader is entitled to \noutcast you at any time prior to the public posting.\nIn addition, you yourself must have been in Demise for\na period of two months, not necessairly consecutive months\nprovided you didn't join any other clan if you were a loner\nat some point.  Once these requirements have been satisified,\na duel will take place in which each side may declare a champion\nto fight in their place.  The winning side becomes the leader.\n\nHONOR:\n\nAny Mutineer must have attained the rank of /2 or above and have at\nleast 5 supporters, those of rank /3 only require 4 supporers, and\nthose of rank /4 only require 3 supporters. He must then post a note \ndeclaring the mutiny that includes character info, mutiny reasons and \nthe names of his supporters.  If this is done, and the supporters are \nverified,1 week of voting will commence. An immortal will count the \nvotes. No recruiting will take place during the week of voting.  Voting \nwith alts will disqualify a person's votes.  The mutineer and /5's may \nnot vote.The loser of the mutiny will be ranked /1 and will hand over all\nvaluables to the victor.\n\nPOSSE:\n\nIf you wish to challenge for leadership, it works as a simple\nmajority vote. In order to be elligible you must first gain \nsupport from at least 3 other posse members.Once you have \nnecessary support, the election begins. Majority wins.\nThe parties involved (being the Leader challenged and the \nchallenger) can not vote.\n\nWARLOCK:\n\nMajority Vote was method used in past, so as it stands that \nis the policy. An Imm would be asked to tally votes.\nMutineer would post cnote to 'Warlock Immortal' declaring mutiny\nand giving name of IMM to post your vote to.\n(so votes can be anonymous) 7 days from post date, vote is tallied, \nwinner is /5 looser is outcast.\n\nZEALOT:\n\nTo mutiny in Zealot, the mutineer must be a rank /4, and have the\nsupport of at least 5 other members who have been ranked above /0\nand who have been in the clan for at least one month's time.\nThe Anointed then has the choice to either settle the dispute\nvia a duel, or a clan vote.\nIf a duel is called for, an IMM will supervise on a preset date which\nwill be at least one week after the mutiny was called. The duel will\nbe to the death, with no charmies. Cheaters will lose automatically.\nIf the Anointed does not wish to duel, he or she may call for a\nclan vote, which shall last for a period of one week. During that\ntime, all /4s shall be reduced to /0 until the vote is decided, or\none of the contesting parties withdraws.\n\nThe loser of either contest will be at the winner's discretion.\n\n~\n\n\n-1 hlab~\n\nThe Infamous Prefresh\n\nQ. What is it?\nA. The prefresh is short for \"player refresh\".  It is a process by which all\ncurrent player files (the file that contains the data about your character in\nfixed storage) and updated to the current MHS game code.\n\nQ. How often will we do this?\nA. If we do it right and make changes correectly, once and once only.\n\nQ. How will I know when I am being prefreshed?\nA. You will be given a 10-day advanced warning before we do it.  We will also\nrun a handful of tests that players can volunteer to put themselves through\nto make sure there are no bugs.\n\nQ. What will happen to my character when I prefresh?\nA. When the day arrives you will log in and the game will detect that your\ncharacter is not marked as being prefreshed already.  You'll be put into a\nsort of secondary creation mode.  You will be told that you need to prefresh\nand an image of your player file will be backed up to a special directory just\nin case something goes wrong.  The game will store in a special data structure\na copy of your important data, and then you'll have to select which method of\nprefresh you want to use.  You'll be guided through the process from there.\n\nQ. What are my options?\nA. Option #1 is the Standard Prefresh.  What happens is that your character\nis set to level 1 and you go to the alignment selection screen.  You pick your\nalignment, and then you to the stat customization screen.  Once that is done,\nyou are put back into the game at level 1, and your skills will all default\nback to their original values.  When you type \"score\", you'll see that you\nhave an item called \"debit levels\".  You may use these at any time to level.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 DIKU~\n.

Here are all the damage verbs listed from\nleast damage to most damage:\n\nclumsy/miss            skillful/harm               OBLITERATES\nclumsy/bruise          skillful/devastating        MASSACRES\nwobbly/scrape          cunning/shredding flesh     ERADICATES\namateur/scratch        strong/spurt blood\namateur/light wds      calculated/GAPING hole\namateur/bleeds         DISEMBOWELS\ncompetent/organ        DISMEMBERS\ncompetent/gasp         ANNIHILATES\n\nAnd, at the far reaches of damaging power, you can do unspeakable things.\n\nThe keywords for spells are slightly different:\n\n    miss        wound           MUTILATE        DEMOLISH\n    scratch     maul            DISEMBOWEL      DEVASTATE\n    graze       decimate        DISMEMBER\tOBLITERATE\n    hit         devastate       MASSACRE\tANNIHILATE\n    injure      maim  \t\tMANGLE\t\tERADICATE\n\nAnd, of course, the unspeakable.\n~\n\n0 TOASTS~\nToast messages now give an indicator as to how badly the victim was creamed\nby his killer, based on the percentage of remaining hitpoints of the killer.\n\nToast Message  \t\t\t    Killer's HP\n----------                          -----------\nSlodhian got slaughtered by Boogums.  \t( 100% +  )\nNightdagger got crushed by a snail.

( < 10%   )\n~\n\n0 DEATH~\nWhen your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple\nof Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,\ntogether with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you (IMMs want \nyou to have your gold).\n\nAny spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.\n\nFollowing and groups are not affected by death.\n\nYou lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of \nthe way back to the beginning of your level.\n\nCorpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.\nPlayer corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).\nOnly the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects\nfrom a player's corpse, unless that person who died was clanned, in which case\ntheir corpse is free for the looting by another clanned player.\n\n~\n\n\n\n0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~\nYour character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set \namount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.\n\nYou gain experience by:\n    \n    killing a player or creature\n    being part of a group that kills a monster\n    participating in a quest that gives experience as a reward\n\nYou lose experience by:\n\n    fleeing from combat\n    recalling out of combat\n    being the target of certain spells\n    dying\n\nThe experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players\nare in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment\nversus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed\nlately; and some random variation.\n~\n\n\n\n0 PET PETS~\nYou can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after \nthe old one dies you may purchase a replacement.  \n\nbuy <pet type> <name>\n\n~\n\n\n\n0 TICK~\nMany of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,\nmost autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,\nweather, and area resetting.\n\nOf these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the\n'tick'.  Ticks on this sled average 45 seconds of real time, but the actual\namount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.\n\nArea resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less\noften (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground\nwill not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.\n~\n\n\n\n0 !~\nSyntax: !\n\n! repeats the last command you typed.\n~\n\n0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~\nSyntax: north\nSyntax: south\nSyntax: east\nSyntax: west\nSyntax: up\nSyntax: down\n\nUse these commands to walk in a particular direction.\n~\n\n0 CAST~\nSyntax: cast <spell> <target>\n\nBefore you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,\nthe higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.\nThe mana cost decreases as your level increases.\n\nThe <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an\nappropriate default target, especially during combat.\n\nIf the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.\nExample: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.\nYou can abbreviate the spell name.\n\nWhen you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.\nThe effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the\nsaving throw successfully.\n\nSee also the help sections for individual spells.\n~\n\n0 EXITS~\nSyntax: exits\n\nTells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.\nYou can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a\ncertain direction and see what you bump into).\n~\n\n0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~\nSyntax: drop <object>\nSyntax: drop <amount> coins\nSyntax: get  <object>\nSyntax: get  <object> <container>\nSyntax: give <object> <character>\nSyntax: give <amount> coins <character>\nSyntax: put  <object> <container>\n\nDROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.\n\nGET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even\nfrom a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.\n\nGIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.\n\nPUT puts an object into a container.\n\nDROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and\n'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.\n~\n\n0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~\nSyntax: equipment\nSyntax: inventory\n\nEQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).\nINVENTORY lists your inventory.\n~\n\n0 COMPARE~\nSyntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>\nSyntax: compare <object>\n \nCOMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,\nit will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are\narmor, it will report the one with the better armor class.\n \nCOMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object\nyou are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.\n \nCOMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.\n~\n\n0 FLEE~\nSyntax: flee\nSyntax: rescue   <character>\n\nOnce you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight\nis not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can\nRESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,\nand costs more experience points, then fleeing).\n\nIf you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep\nfighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances\nof making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.\n~\n\n0 EXAMINE LOOK~\nSyntax: look\nSyntax: look    <object>\nSyntax: look    <character>\nSyntax: look    <direction>\nSyntax: look    <keyword>\nSyntax: look in <container>\nSyntax: look in <corpse>\nSyntax: examine <container>\nSyntax: examine <corpse>\n\nLOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.\n\nEXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.\n~\n\n0 ORDER~\nSyntax: order <character> command\nSyntax: order all command\n\nORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to\nperform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible\nfor the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers\nwill incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.\n\nMost charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).\n\nIf your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.\n~\n\n0 SLEEP~\nSyntax: cast 'sleep' <victim>\n\nThis spell puts its victim to sleep.\n~\n\n0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~\nSyntax: rest\nSyntax: sleep\nSyntax: stand\nSyntax: wake\n\nThese commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you \nregenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.\nHowever, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,\nyou won't hear many things happen.\n\nUse STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can\nalso WAKE other sleeping characters.\n~\n\n0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~\nSyntax: gtell <message>\nSyntax: say   <message>\nSyntax: tell  <character> <message>\n\nAll of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to\nall of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are\nsleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.\n\nSAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''\nis a synonym for SAY.\n\nTELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.\n\nREPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work\neven if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This\nis handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.\n~\n-1 SLED~\nA SLED is a Slightly Liquid Earthy Dementia.\n~\n\n-1 NOTE NOTES SPOOL BUG CHANGE NEWS INOTE ONOTE CNOTE GNOTE IDEA QNOTE~\nThe notes on MHS replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many\nother sleds.  There are several types of notes including In-Character notes \n(inotes), Out-of-Character Notes(onotes), Bug Notes (bug), Quest Notes (qnotes) \nand God Notes (gnote). \nThe following options are usable(in this case, an inote is used as an example, for other types of notes, simply replace inote with the appropriate type of note):\n\nreading notes:\ninote list\t: show all inotes (unread notes are marked with an N)\ninote read\t: either by number, or read next to read unread inotes\ninote remove\t: removes an inote that you wrote or are the target of\ninote catchup\t: markes all inotes as read\nspool           : Catches up all notes of all types\nunread          : Lists notes that have not been read by this character\n\nwriting new notes:\ninote to\t: sets the to line (name, clanname, 'clans', immortal, or all)\ninote subject\t: sets the subject for a new inote\ninote +\t\t: adds a line to a new inote (i.e. inote + hi guys!)\ninote -\t\t: remove a line from an inote in progress\ninote clear\t: erase an inote in progress\nnote show\t: shows the inote you are working on\ninote post\t: posts a new inote. This MUST be done to post an inote.\n\nWhen you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type\nnote read to scroll through them one at a time.\n\nFour other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, and \npenalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example\nidea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards is\nrestricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on\nall the note spools.\n\n~\n0 GOSSIP CGOSSIP . SHOUT YELL~\nSyntax: gossip  <message>\nSyntax: cgossip <message>\nSyntax: yell    <message>\n\nGOSSIP and CGOSSIP send messages to all plays who are listening to the \nchannel.  The '.' is a shortened version of the GOSSIP command. \n\nYELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.\n\nType a channel name by itself to turn it off.\n~\n\n0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~\nSyntax: emote <action>\nSyntax: pose\n\nEMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are\nseveral dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK\n(type socials or help socials for a listing).\n\nPMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's\nname (i.e. pmote bonks Rusty will be read as bonks you by Rusty, and as \nbonks Rusty by everyone else).\n\nPOSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.\n~\n\n52 SMOTE~\nSyntax: smote <action>\n\nSmote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in\nthe string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.\n~\n\n0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~\nSyntax: hold   <object>\nSyntax: remove <object>\nSyntax: wear   <object>\nSyntax: wear   all\nSyntax: wield  <object>\n\nThree of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using\nit as equipment.

So if there are two\nswords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of\nan item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into\n(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  \n\nBe careful!  Type carefully when buyign things.  If the shopkeeper thinks\nyou are trying to cheat him out of his wares by feeding him weird information,\nhe'll confiscate all your money.  Know the 'buy' command inside and out.\n\nLIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.\nList <name> shows you only objects of that name.\n\nSELL sells an object to a shop keeper.\n\nVALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.\n~\n\n0 SACRIFICE~\nSyntax: sacrifice <object>\n\nSACRIFICE offers an object to your deity, who may reward you.\nThe nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.\n~\n\n0 SCROLL~\nSyntax: scroll\nSyntax: scroll <number>\n\nThis command changes the number of lines the sled sends you in a page (the \ndefault is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen\nsizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.\n~\n\n0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~\nSyntax: brandish\nSyntax: quaff    <potion>\nSyntax: recite   <scroll> <target>\nSyntax: zap      <target>\nSyntax: zap\n\nBRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed\nto DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the\n<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a\nmagical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting\nsomeone, then that character is used for a target.\n\nYou must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.\n\nAll of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single\ncharge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no\nmore charges, it will be consumed.\n\nThese commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries\non the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.\n~\n\n0 CONSIDER~\nSyntax: consider <character>\n\nCONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.\nOf course, it's only a rough estimate.\n~\n\n0 FOLLOW GROUP~\nSyntax: follow <character>\nSyntax: group\nSyntax: group <character>\n\nFOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,\njust FOLLOW <yourself>.\n\nGROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.\nGroup members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and\nSPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically\njoin the fight.\n\nIf the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will\nkick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your\ngroup by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.\n\nGROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.\n\nYou may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of\nyour own.\n~\n\n0 VISIBLE~\nVISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,\nmaking you visible again.\n~\n\n0 QUIT RENT SAVE~\nSyntax: QUIT\nSyntax: RENT ... not!\nSyntax: SAVE\n\nSAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every\n15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save\nwill block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.\n(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)\n\nSome objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.\n\nQUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game \nyou will be back in the same room.\n\nQUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one\ncommand.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into\nthe habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other sled that\ndoesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.\n\nThere is no RENT in this sled.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.\n~\n\n0 RECALL /~\nSyntax: RECALL\n\nRECALL prays to your deity for miraculous transportation from where you are\nback to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.\n\nIf you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),\nand you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This\nchance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not \ninsure success.\n\nRECALL costs half of your movement points.\n\nRECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a\ncurse may not recall at all.\n~\n\n-1 SPLIT~\nSyntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>\n\nSPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your\ngroup who are in the same room as you.

Only those in the\nclan system may steal from other characters.\nIf you are caught stealing from another character, you will receive the\nTHIEF flag.  If you are caught stealing from a mob, they will attack\nyou.\n\n~\n\n0 PRACTICE~\nSyntax: PRACTICE\nSyntax: PRACTICE <-new|-skill|-spell|-old|-skip> <skill/spell name>\n\nPRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all\nthe skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.\n\nPRACTICE with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell. \nYour learning percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a maximum of 100%\nYou must be at a guild master to practice.\n\nPRACTICE -new will display your skills/spells less then 75%.\n\nPRACTICE -skills will display only your skills.\n\nPRACTICE -spells will display only your spells.\n\nPRACTICE -old with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up\nto your old skill % prior to Pfresh for a cost of 1 practice. If you are\nnot a pfresh character then this option is not useable.\n\nPRACTICE -skip with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up\nregularly, ignoring any old skill % prior to Pfresh.\n\nThe higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice\nsession.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will\nhave each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you\ndo use them.\n~\n\n0 TRAIN~\nSyntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana moves>\n\nTRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your\ncharacter has standard attributes based on your class, and several\ninitial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by\nusing these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).\n\nIt takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase\nmoves,mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.\n\nThe best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more\npractice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.\nIn the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train\nWIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.\n~\n57 FUCK~\nSyntax: fuck <character>\n\nFUCK is used on the more annoying players, and those that are spamming\nincessently.  The technicalities of the command will be spared, but it\ndoes basically what it says.  It is similar to the DISCONNECT command,\nbut has it's special twist.  Use this command to bide time or annoy an\nannoying user.  It should, in most cases, take them a bit to relog.\n~\n\n59 ADVANCE~\nSyntax: advance <character> <level>\n\nADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the\nonly way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE\nmay also be used to demote characters.\n~\n\n60 TRUST~\nSyntax: trust <character> <level>\n\nTRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to\nadvancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect\non combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or\nimmortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up\nthe character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their\nnatural level.\n\nA trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.\n~\n\n57 DNS UNDNS~\nSyntax: dns <IP or IP block>\n        undns <listed IP or IP block>\n\tdns\n\nDNS <IP or IP block> adds to a linked list of strings that are\nchecked against the IP of an incoming socket to see if it should\nbe looked up for an IP to name record (PTR).  The check uses a\nstr_prefix() comparison so partial blocks will work as well\nas full dotted quad IP's.\n\nRunning the command with no arguments shows the current list.\nThe 'undns' command removes the exact matching string from the list.\n\nTypos containing non-IP strings simply get skipped since they never\nmatch an IP or block.  But, typos should be removed.\n~\n\n58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~\nSyntax: allow   <site>\n\tban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>\n\tban\n\nBAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with\nno arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from\nthe ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.\n\nA site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set\nby editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.\n*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or \ncontent (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many\nsites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.\n~\n\n59 EQLIST~\nSyntax: eqlist <all|armor|weapons>\n\nEQLIST generates a flat file in /mud/moosehead/src called eqlist.eql (all),\narmor.eql (armor) or weapons.eql (weapons). The file contains a listing of\nthe equipment in a designated way for a PERL Script to parse into an online\nequipment list.\n~\n\n59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~\nSyntax: reboot\n\tshutdown\n\nReboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used\nto control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow\nold connections to die), followed by a reboot.\n\nShutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script\nfrom restarting it.\n\nNever, ever, shutdown the sled without consulting Rusty.\n~\n\n\n56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~\nSyntax: wizlock\n\tnewlock\n\nWizlock and newlock both block login attempts to MooseHead Sled. Wizlock locks\nout all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who\nare returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically\nused for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,\nand newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to Rusty and Creators.\n\nA god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.\n~\n\n59 DENY~\nSyntax: deny <name>\n\nDeny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character\nname unusable.  It may only be removed by having a 59 pload the character, so\nfreeze is usually preferred.\n~\n\n57 DISCONNECT~\nSyntax: disconnect <name>\n\nDisconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet\nprompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying\nplayers.\n~\n\n57 FREEZE~\nSyntax: freeze <name>\n\nFREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any\ncommands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a \ntroublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.\n~\n\n55 CTALK~\nSyntax: ctalk <clan> <message>\n\nCtalk lets an immortal speak on a clan channel without the need\nto guild themself into and out of the clan in question.  It also\nautomatically turns on LISTEN if it's off, so that you will hear\nany responses to your message.\n\nSEE ALSO:  listen\n~\n\n55 LISTEN~\nsyntax: listen\n\nListen is a toggle that allows you to turn on or off the ability\nto listen in on clan channels.  If on, any communication done over\na clan channel is also printed out to you, along with a header\ndenoting the clan channel it came across.\n~\n\n53 FORCE~\nSyntax: force <character> <command>\nSyntax: force all <command>\n\nFORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.\n\nBelow level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is\nunavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. \n\nFORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.\nThis is typically used for 'force all save'.\n~\n\n57 FUCK~\n'Fuck' is a command that starts a Zmodem download on that players side,\nthereby dumping him/her, and basically 'fuck'ing up their connection and\nterminal.  Sometimes, it will have devestating affects, sometimes, it will\nonly be as good as a 'disconnect'.\n~\n\n56 SOCKETS~\nSyntax: sockets\n\tsockets <name> \n\nSOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including \nusers in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the \nchannel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in \nmerc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.\n\nThe optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used\nto identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched\ninto an orc).\n~\n58 HOSTMASK~\nSyntax: hostmask <password> <string> <character>\n\nNOTE:  THE CHARACTER YOU ARE HOSTMASKING *MUST* BE CONNECTED!!!\n       If you try to hostmask a ploaded or link dead character\n       you WILL crash the game.\n\nHostmask allows you to mask the ip address of the socket you are coming \nin on.  This can be usefull if you do not want others to know who your \nmorts are.\n\n~\n56 LOAD~\nSyntax: load mob <vnum>\n\tload obj <vnum> <level>\n\nThe load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to \nduplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum\ncommand, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.\n\nLoad puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are\nput in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old\nformat objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new\nformat objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.\n(see also clone, vnum, stat)\n~\n55 FLAG~\nFLAG is used to set mob and character flags\nSyntax:\nflag mob  <name> <field> <flags>\n     mob  flags: act,aff,off,imm,res,vuln,form,part\n\nflag char <name> <field> <flags>\n     char flags: plr,comm,aff,imm,res,vuln,mhs\n\n+: add flag, -: remove flag, = set equal to otherwise flag toggles the flags\nlisted.\n\nPlayer Flags ( plr )\nnpc           autoassist     autoexit        autoloot,\nautosac       autogold       autosplit       honor\ncircle        demise         balance         loner\nholylight     can_loot       nosummon        nofollow\npermit        dweeb          log             deny\nfreeze        thief          killer\n\nCommunication flags ( comm )\nquiet         deaf           nowiz           noclangossip\nnogossip      noooc          noquestion      nomusic\nnoclan        noquest        nograts         noemote\nnoshout       noshout        notell          nochannels\nnonotes       snoop_proof    afk\n\nAffect Flags ( aff )\nTo add a flag:    flag char <name> plr +: <flag> \nTo remove a flag: flag char <name> plr -: <flag> \nblind         invisible      detect_evil     detect_invis\ndetect_magic  detect_hidden  detect_good     sanctuary\nfaerie_fire   infrared       curse           poison\nprotect_evil  protect_good   sneak           hide\nsleep         charm          flying          pass_door\nhaste         calm\n\nImmunityFlags ( imm ) ResistanceFlags (res) VulnFlags (vuln)\nThese flags are all used to set immunities, resistances and \nvulns.\nsummon        charm          magic           weapon\nbash          pierce         slash           fire\ncold          lightning      acid            poison\nnegative      holy           energy          mental\ndisease       drowning       light           sound\nwood          silver         iron      \n~\n\n58 SET~\nSyntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>\n\tset obj   <object> <field> <value>\n\tset room  <number> <field> <value>\n\tset skill <char>   <name>  <rating>\n\tset skill <char>   all     <rating>\n\nThe set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data\nstructures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.\nSet skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value\ngiven.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.\n(see also string, stat)\n~\n\n55 STRING~\nSyntax: string obj <field> <string>\n\tstring mob <field> <string>\n\nThe string command changes the various strings associated with an object or\nmobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string\nmob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.\nWhen doing a restring here are some rules:\n*You may not restring an item so that it's name, short, or long\nmatch an existing item in the game.  Always vnum what they are\nasking for to see if it is an item in the game.\n\nExample of  Bad Restrings:\nan assassin's quiver restrung to a pair of black dragon scale leggings\na portable hole restrung to a gnomish sword\n\nExample of Ok Restrings:\nan assassin's quiver restrung to a dragon scale pouch\na portable hole restrung to a vat of gumbo\n\nThe assassin's quiver is a container, a dragon scale pouch leads \npeople to believe it is a container.  Hence, that would be an ok\nrestring.\n*All words in the name must appear in the short and long descriptions\n\nGenerally, morts will say \"i want this to be called joes big gun\"\nIt is up to you to make sure that \"joes big gun\" appears in the short\nand long description.\n\nExample of a Bad Restring:\nOrigional Item:  rangers backpack\nNew Name:        my secret hidey hole bag\nNew Short:       rangers backpack\nNew Long:        A rangers backpack lies here.\n\nThe above would be a very very very bad restring.  \n\nExample of a Good Restring:\nOrigional Item:  rangers backpack\nwhat the mort wants:  my secret hidey hole bag\nNew Name:        my secret hidey hole bag his\nNew Short:       his serect hidey hole bag\nNew Long:        My secret hidey hole bag lies here.\n\nThe short is different so it looks \"cool\" when they take things\nout of the bag they say.  So, it is up to you to make sure that\n\"my\" appears in the name of the item.\n----------\n*Always get permission before putting other people's names in \na restring.\n\nIf you have any questions about this, please ask an admin\n\n~\n\n55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~\nSyntax: nochannel <character>\n\tnoemote   <character>\n\tnoshout   <character>\n\tnotell    <character>\n\nNoemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by\npreventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.\nCharacters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those\nforms of communication.\n\nThe nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim\nfrom using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.\nNochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.\n~\n\n57 PARDON~\nSyntax: pardon <character> killer\n\tpardon <character> thief\n\nPardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you\nare sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic\npardon.\n~\n\n56 PURGE~\nSyntax: purge\n\tpurge <character>\n\nPurge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the\nNPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one\ncharacter from anywhere in the world.\n\nPurge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag\nset (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be\npurged if they are called directly by name.\n~\n\n56 RESTORE~\nSyntax: restore <character>\n\trestore room\n\trestore all\n\trestore nonclan\n\nRestore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the\ntarget character.

Best not to use this\ncommand on players if you enjoy being a god.\n~\n\n55 TRANSFER TELEPORT~\nSyntax: transfer <character>\n\ttransfer all\n\ttransfer <character> <location>\n\ttransfer all         <location>\n\nTransfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,\nto your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all \nshould almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have\nhorrible effects on slow links.

The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of\na mobile, or as the name of an object.\n\nAt works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the\ncommand, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your\nlocation).\n~\n\n54 ECHO GECHO PECHO ZECHO~\nSyntax: echo  <message>\n\tgecho <message>\n\tpecho <character> <message>\n\nThese commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to\nall characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent\nit.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho\nsends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level\ngod will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it\nis an echo.  Zecho is an echo throughout the entire current area.\n~\n\n52 GOTO~\nSyntax: goto <location>\n\nGoto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,\nas the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.\n\nYou may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters\nalready present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters\nalready present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain\ngod level.\n\nImplementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.\n~\n52 SKSTAT~\nSyntax: skstat <player>\n\nSkstat will show you the targets skills and the percents they are at.\n\n~\n\n52 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~\nSyntax: holylight\n\twiznvis <level>\n\nHolylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and\nmobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more\neasily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.\n\nWizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of\na lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum\n(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally \ninvisible.\n~\n\n52 INCOGNITO~\nToggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the\nroom you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes\na level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see\nyou regarless of location.\n~ \n\n52 MEMORY~\nSyntax: memory\n\nMemory reports the size of your sled.\n\nThe 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,\nnot the number of instances currently in the game.\n\nThe 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.

Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is\nvery useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and\nthe slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.\n(see also load)\n~\n\n53 STAT~\nSyntax: stat <name>\n\tstat mob  <name>\n\tstat obj  <name>\n\tstat room <number>\n\nThe stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room\nwithin the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object\n(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room \n(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are\nstanding in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.\n(see also goto, transfer)\n~\n\n53 MWHERE~\nSyntax: mwhere <name>\n\nMwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.\n~\n\n55 PEACE~\nSyntax: peace\n\nPeace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the\nAGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.\n~\n\n52 POOFIN POOFOUT~\nSyntax: poofin  <message>\nSyntax: pooffout <message>\n\nThe standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and\n'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of\nyour own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.

Removing \nprotected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.\n~\n\n58 REWARD~\nSyntax: reward <character> <amount of XP>\n\nThe reward command is used to give experience points to players in\ninstances where they either win it through a quest, or you feel they\nare owed it due to an IMM mistake.  Please use sparingly.\n\n~\n\n55 LOG SNOOP~\nSyntax: log   <character>\n\tlog   all\n\tsnoop <character>\n\nLog <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into\nthe server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.\nLogs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied\nby mail to Rusty.  \n\nCertain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain\ncommands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.\n\nLog all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not\npersist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell Rusty.\n\n\nSnoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.\nThe character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one\ncharacter at a time. Try to respect privacy.\n\nSnoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.\n~\n\n54 SWITCH RETURN~\nSyntax: switch <character>\n\treturn\n\nSwitch switches you into the body of another character (who must not\nalready have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC).

You will be asked to provide the short\ndescription and long description (and in some cases the keywords, or name)\nof the item. The keywords you choose must be in both the long and short\ndescriptions you provide.\n\nA short description is what you see when and item is in a shop, being worn,\nor in your inventory.  A long description is what you see when an item is\neither examined/looked at, or on the ground.\n\nFor example:\nshort description: a sub issue shield\nlong description: You see a sub issue shield here.\nkeywors: sub issue shield   \n\n\n1)    The keywords you choose *MUST* exist in both the long and short\n      descriptions.  If there is more than one key, you may have one\n      key in the short description, and a different one in the long\n      description, so long both long and short have a keyword in them.\n\n2)    Several different objects may not be restrung with the exact same\n      name.  This means at the same time or over time.  Objects found to\n      be intentionally restrung with duplicate names will be confiscated.\n\n3)    You may not include the name of another character in the restring\n      of an item without the express consent of that character.\n\n4)    Containers must be restrung to something that resembles a container\n      in some fashion.  Be creative, but no restringing \"a bag\" into \"a\n      shoe\".\n\n5)    There is no discount for multiple restrings at the same time.  The\n      pricing listed above is very reasonable. \n\nWhen an Immortal does a restring for you it is polite to pay attention to\nwhat they are saying and it is always a good idea to know what you want\nbefore you ask for a restring (unless you have prior arrangements with that\nimmortal), to avoid causing an Immortal unnecessary trouble.  If you follow\nthe directions given above your experiences with recieving restrings should\nbe wonderful, memorable experiences.\n~\n52 STARTGLAD~\nStartglad is used to start Gladiator events.\nSyntax:\nstartglad <type> <min level> <max level> <ticks till start> <blind/noblind> <ticks till end>\n\nType has to be one of the following:\n     1 - Singles Event\n     2 - Random Teams Event  \n     3 - Assigned Teams Event \n\nLevels have to be between one and sixty.\nTicks till start has to be at least three.\nBlind will hide the names of the other gladiators.\nNoblind will show the gladiators thier opponents Names.\n~\n52 ENDGLAD~\nEndglad is used to end Gladiator events.\nSyntax:\nendglad <victor's name/none>\n\nYou may have the victor of the event announed by passing it to endglad\nor you may say none if no one won.\n~\n52 REMOVEGLAD~\nRemoveglad is used to remove a player from the event.

It is a process by which all\ncurrent player files (the file that contains the data about your character in\nfixed storage) and updated to the current MHS game code.\n\nQ. How often will we do this?\nA. If we do it right and make changes correectly, once and once only.\n\nQ. How will I know when I am being prefreshed?\nA. You will be given a 10-day advanced warning before we do it.  We will also\nrun a handful of tests that players can volunteer to put themselves through\nto make sure there are no bugs.\n\nQ. What will happen to my character when I prefresh?\nA. When the day arrives you will log in and the game will detect that your\ncharacter is not marked as being prefreshed already.  You'll be put into a\nsort of secondary creation mode.  You will be told that you need to prefresh\nand an image of your player file will be backed up to a special directory just\nin case something goes wrong.  The game will store in a special data structure\na copy of your important data, and then you'll have to select which method of\nprefresh you want to use.  You'll be guided through the process from there.\n\nQ. What are my options?\nA. Option #1 is the Standard Prefresh.  What happens is that your character\nis set to level 1 and you go to the alignment selection screen.  You pick your\nalignment, and then you to the stat customization screen.  Once that is done,\nyou are put back into the game at level 1, and your skills will all default\nback to their original values.  When you type \"score\", you'll see that you\nhave an item called \"debit levels\".  You may use these at any time to level.","description":"-1 DIKU","race":".

All you\nneed to do, is:\n1.  Announce intent with the support of 1 /4.  (If you are\na /4, thats fine, support of any other member is acceptable.\n2.  A vote will be held, winner takes all.  If there is a tie\nthen it is settled by dual.\n3.  Anyone guilded within 2 weeks of the Mutiny is NOT permitted\na vote.\n4.  The loser will be required to leave all EQ behind.  This is\nso the leader (Whom may be holding clan funds) doesn't make\nit out the door and screw the clan.  It will be up to the\nwinner to return any other gear.  (which would follow charter)\n\nDEMISE:\n\nTo mutiny in Demise, you need to have five supporters who\nare different characters, and you must organize the mutiny\nin seret, posting the mutiny note to Demise and the immortals\nonce the supporters, one of which must be a /4, have been\narranged.  Otherwise, the current leader is entitled to \noutcast you at any time prior to the public posting.\nIn addition, you yourself must have been in Demise for\na period of two months, not necessairly consecutive months\nprovided you didn't join any other clan if you were a loner\nat some point.  Once these requirements have been satisified,\na duel will take place in which each side may declare a champion\nto fight in their place.  The winning side becomes the leader.\n\nHONOR:\n\nAny Mutineer must have attained the rank of /2 or above and have at\nleast 5 supporters, those of rank /3 only require 4 supporers, and\nthose of rank /4 only require 3 supporters. He must then post a note \ndeclaring the mutiny that includes character info, mutiny reasons and \nthe names of his supporters.  If this is done, and the supporters are \nverified,1 week of voting will commence. An immortal will count the \nvotes. No recruiting will take place during the week of voting.  Voting \nwith alts will disqualify a person's votes.  The mutineer and /5's may \nnot vote.The loser of the mutiny will be ranked /1 and will hand over all\nvaluables to the victor.\n\nPOSSE:\n\nIf you wish to challenge for leadership, it works as a simple\nmajority vote. In order to be elligible you must first gain \nsupport from at least 3 other posse members.Once you have \nnecessary support, the election begins. Majority wins.\nThe parties involved (being the Leader challenged and the \nchallenger) can not vote.\n\nWARLOCK:\n\nMajority Vote was method used in past, so as it stands that \nis the policy. An Imm would be asked to tally votes.\nMutineer would post cnote to 'Warlock Immortal' declaring mutiny\nand giving name of IMM to post your vote to.\n(so votes can be anonymous) 7 days from post date, vote is tallied, \nwinner is /5 looser is outcast.\n\nZEALOT:\n\nTo mutiny in Zealot, the mutineer must be a rank /4, and have the\nsupport of at least 5 other members who have been ranked above /0\nand who have been in the clan for at least one month's time.\nThe Anointed then has the choice to either settle the dispute\nvia a duel, or a clan vote.\nIf a duel is called for, an IMM will supervise on a preset date which\nwill be at least one week after the mutiny was called. The duel will\nbe to the death, with no charmies. Cheaters will lose automatically.\nIf the Anointed does not wish to duel, he or she may call for a\nclan vote, which shall last for a period of one week. During that\ntime, all /4s shall be reduced to /0 until the vote is decided, or\none of the contesting parties withdraws.\n\nThe loser of either contest will be at the winner's discretion.\n\n~\n\n\n-1 hlab~\n\nThe Infamous Prefresh\n\nQ. What is it?\nA. The prefresh is short for \"player refresh\".  It is a process by which all\ncurrent player files (the file that contains the data about your character in\nfixed storage) and updated to the current MHS game code.\n\nQ. How often will we do this?\nA. If we do it right and make changes correectly, once and once only.\n\nQ. How will I know when I am being prefreshed?\nA. You will be given a 10-day advanced warning before we do it.  We will also\nrun a handful of tests that players can volunteer to put themselves through\nto make sure there are no bugs.\n\nQ. What will happen to my character when I prefresh?\nA. When the day arrives you will log in and the game will detect that your\ncharacter is not marked as being prefreshed already.  You'll be put into a\nsort of secondary creation mode.  You will be told that you need to prefresh\nand an image of your player file will be backed up to a special directory just\nin case something goes wrong.  The game will store in a special data structure\na copy of your important data, and then you'll have to select which method of\nprefresh you want to use.  You'll be guided through the process from there.\n\nQ. What are my options?\nA. Option #1 is the Standard Prefresh.  What happens is that your character\nis set to level 1 and you go to the alignment selection screen.  You pick your\nalignment, and then you to the stat customization screen.  Once that is done,\nyou are put back into the game at level 1, and your skills will all default\nback to their original values.  When you type \"score\", you'll see that you\nhave an item called \"debit levels\".  You may use these at any time to level.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 DIKU~\n.

Gold coins are worth\n100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as \nopposed to 100 to the pound for silver).  For your sledding convenience, a\nmoney changer can be found in northern Midgaard on clan road, he charges a\n5% fee for his services.  Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems\nfrom the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.\n10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for\nthe highest quality stones.\n~\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n \n\n0 BRIEF COMPACT~\n\nBrief and compact help set your display options for the game. \n\nTyping brief without any arguments toggles combat failed attack messages..\nBrief can also be used with the following options:\n\n  room           - toggles long room descriptions\n  longeq         - displays full equipment slot list\n  wholist        - short version of the wholist (IMM only)\n  combat         - supress failed attack messages \n  chardesc       - toggles character descriptions\n  surname\t - show surnames in the who list\n  titles\t - show player titles in the who list\n\nCompact toggles the presence/absence of the blank line before your prompt.\n~\n\n-1 DEAF~\nThe deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded\nby messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to\nreply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you\ncannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly \nuseful for sending a quick \"I'm being spammed so I went deaf\" message to\na person).\n~\n\n-1 AFK~\nTyping AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell\nto you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing\nrecall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,\nbut don't want to miss tells.

Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,\ntogether with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you (IMMs want \nyou to have your gold).\n\nAny spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.\n\nFollowing and groups are not affected by death.\n\nYou lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of \nthe way back to the beginning of your level.\n\nCorpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.\nPlayer corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).\nOnly the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects\nfrom a player's corpse, unless that person who died was clanned, in which case\ntheir corpse is free for the looting by another clanned player.\n\n~\n\n\n\n0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~\nYour character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set \namount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.\n\nYou gain experience by:\n    \n    killing a player or creature\n    being part of a group that kills a monster\n    participating in a quest that gives experience as a reward\n\nYou lose experience by:\n\n    fleeing from combat\n    recalling out of combat\n    being the target of certain spells\n    dying\n\nThe experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players\nare in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment\nversus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed\nlately; and some random variation.\n~\n\n\n\n0 PET PETS~\nYou can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after \nthe old one dies you may purchase a replacement.  \n\nbuy <pet type> <name>\n\n~\n\n\n\n0 TICK~\nMany of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,\nmost autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,\nweather, and area resetting.\n\nOf these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the\n'tick'.  Ticks on this sled average 45 seconds of real time, but the actual\namount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.\n\nArea resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less\noften (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground\nwill not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.\n~\n\n\n\n0 !~\nSyntax: !\n\n! repeats the last command you typed.\n~\n\n0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~\nSyntax: north\nSyntax: south\nSyntax: east\nSyntax: west\nSyntax: up\nSyntax: down\n\nUse these commands to walk in a particular direction.\n~\n\n0 CAST~\nSyntax: cast <spell> <target>\n\nBefore you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,\nthe higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.\nThe mana cost decreases as your level increases.\n\nThe <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an\nappropriate default target, especially during combat.\n\nIf the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.\nExample: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.\nYou can abbreviate the spell name.\n\nWhen you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.\nThe effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the\nsaving throw successfully.\n\nSee also the help sections for individual spells.\n~\n\n0 EXITS~\nSyntax: exits\n\nTells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.\nYou can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.

TAKE is a synonym for get.\n\nGIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.\n\nPUT puts an object into a container.\n\nDROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and\n'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.\n~\n\n0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~\nSyntax: equipment\nSyntax: inventory\n\nEQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).\nINVENTORY lists your inventory.\n~\n\n0 COMPARE~\nSyntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>\nSyntax: compare <object>\n \nCOMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,\nit will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are\narmor, it will report the one with the better armor class.\n \nCOMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object\nyou are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.\n \nCOMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.\n~\n\n0 FLEE~\nSyntax: flee\nSyntax: rescue   <character>\n\nOnce you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight\nis not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can\nRESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,\nand costs more experience points, then fleeing).\n\nIf you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep\nfighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances\nof making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.\n~\n\n0 EXAMINE LOOK~\nSyntax: look\nSyntax: look    <object>\nSyntax: look    <character>\nSyntax: look    <direction>\nSyntax: look    <keyword>\nSyntax: look in <container>\nSyntax: look in <corpse>\nSyntax: examine <container>\nSyntax: examine <corpse>\n\nLOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.\n\nEXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.\n~\n\n0 ORDER~\nSyntax: order <character> command\nSyntax: order all command\n\nORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to\nperform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible\nfor the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers\nwill incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.\n\nMost charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).\n\nIf your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.\n~\n\n0 SLEEP~\nSyntax: cast 'sleep' <victim>\n\nThis spell puts its victim to sleep.\n~\n\n0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~\nSyntax: rest\nSyntax: sleep\nSyntax: stand\nSyntax: wake\n\nThese commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you \nregenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.\nHowever, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,\nyou won't hear many things happen.\n\nUse STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can\nalso WAKE other sleeping characters.\n~\n\n0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~\nSyntax: gtell <message>\nSyntax: say   <message>\nSyntax: tell  <character> <message>\n\nAll of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to\nall of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are\nsleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.\n\nSAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''\nis a synonym for SAY.\n\nTELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.\n\nREPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work\neven if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.

Type\nnote read to scroll through them one at a time.\n\nFour other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, and \npenalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example\nidea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards is\nrestricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on\nall the note spools.\n\n~\n0 GOSSIP CGOSSIP . SHOUT YELL~\nSyntax: gossip  <message>\nSyntax: cgossip <message>\nSyntax: yell    <message>\n\nGOSSIP and CGOSSIP send messages to all plays who are listening to the \nchannel.  The '.' is a shortened version of the GOSSIP command. \n\nYELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.\n\nType a channel name by itself to turn it off.\n~\n\n0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~\nSyntax: emote <action>\nSyntax: pose\n\nEMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are\nseveral dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK\n(type socials or help socials for a listing).\n\nPMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's\nname (i.e. pmote bonks Rusty will be read as bonks you by Rusty, and as \nbonks Rusty by everyone else).\n\nPOSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.\n~\n\n52 SMOTE~\nSyntax: smote <action>\n\nSmote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in\nthe string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.\n~\n\n0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~\nSyntax: hold   <object>\nSyntax: remove <object>\nSyntax: wear   <object>\nSyntax: wear   all\nSyntax: wield  <object>\n\nThree of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using\nit as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for\narmor.  WIELD is for weapons.\n\nWEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your\ninventory.\n\nYou may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not\nmatch yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough\nto use it properly.\n\nREMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your\ninventory.\n~\n\n\n0 BUG TYPO~\nSyntax: bug <message>\nSyntax: idea <message>\nSyntax: typo <message>\n\nThese commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback\nto the sled implementors.\n~\n\n0 CREDITS~\nSyntax: credits\n\nThis command shows the list of the original Diku Mud implementors.\n~\n\n0 AREAS COMMANDS REPORT SCORE TIME~\nSyntax: areas\nSyntax: commands\nSyntax: report\nSyntax: score\nSyntax: time\nSyntax: weather\n\nAREAS shows you a list of areas in the game.\n\nCOMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game.\n\nREPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other\nplayers in the room.  SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.\nYour ability scores are shown as true value(current value), so for example\nStr: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength\nfrom other factors (spells or items).\n\nTIME shows the game time, as well as the time the sled was last started,\nand the current local time for the host computer.\n\nWEATHER shows the current game weather.\n~\n\n-1 WHO~\nSyntax: who\nSyntax: who <level-range>\nSyntax: who <class or race>\nSyntax: who <clan or nonclan>\nSyntax: who <clan name>\nSyntax: who <class or race> <level-range> <clan name>\n\nWHO shows the people currently in the game.  Some people may choose to\nremain unseen and won't appear on the WHO\n \nWHO without any arguments shows all of the (visible) people currently playing.\n\nWith arguments, WHO can show players of certain classes or levels.\nFor example:\n \nwho 10          lists all players of level 10 or above\nwho 15 20       lists all players between level 15 and 20\nwho cleric      lists all clerics playing\nwho immortal    lists all immortals playing\nwho cleric 1 5  lists all clerics between levels 1 and 5\nwho elf cleric  lists all elven clerics\nwho demise e m  lists all elven mages in Demise \nwho clan        lists all the clanners\nwho nonclan     lists all the nonclanners\n\nClasses and races may be abbreviated.\n~\n\n-1 WHOIS~\nSyntax: whois <name>\nThe whois command identifies any user who matches the name given. For\nexample, 'whois a' shows all characters whose name begins with A.\n~\n\n0 WHERE SCAN~\nSyntax: scan\nSyntax: where\nSyntax: scan <character>\nSyntax: where <character>\n\nWHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same\narea as you are.\n\nWHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name\nwithin your area, including monsters.\n\nSCAN is a synonym for WHERE.\n~\n\n0 HELP~\nSyntax: help\nSyntax: help <keyword>\n\nHELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.\n\nHELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include\nall the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.\n~\n\n0 DESCRIPTION DESC~\nSyntax: description <string>\nSyntax: description + <string>\nSyntax: description - \n\nSets your long description to the given string.  If the description string\nstarts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current\ndescription, so that you can make multi-line descriptions. You can delete\nlines by uses description -.\n~\n\n0 PASSWORD~\nSyntax: password <old-password> <new-password>\n\nPASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be\nyour old password.  The second argument is your new password.\n\nThe PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.\n~\n\n0 TITLE~\nSyntax: title <string>\n\nSets your title to a given string.\n\nThe game supplies a title when your character is created.  Note that if\nyou include color codes, your title will be artificially shortened.\n~\n\n0 WIMPY~\nSyntax: wimpy\nSyntax: wimpy <number>\n\nWIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces\nyour hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.\nYou will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not\nbeen using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been\ntripped or bash by an enemy.\n\nWIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.\n\nSome monsters are wimpy.\n~\n\n0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~\nSyntax: open   <object|direction>\nSyntax: close  <object|direction>\nSyntax: lock   <object|direction>\nSyntax: unlock <object|direction>\nSyntax: pick   <object|direction>\n\nOPEN and CLOSE open and close an object or a door.\n\nLOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have\nthe requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.\n\nPICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,\nyou must practice the appropriate skill.\n~\n\n0 DRINK EAT FILL POUR~\nSyntax: drink <object>\nSyntax: eat   <object>\nSyntax: fill  <object> <fountain>\nSyntax: pour  <object> out\nSyntax: pour  <object> <object>\nSyntax: pour  <object> <character>\n\nWhen you are thirsty, DRINK something.\n\nWhen you are hungry, EAT something.\n\nFILL fills a drink container with liquid from a fountain.\n\nPOUR transfers a liquid to a container, or empties one.\nYou can also pour from an object into something a character is holding.\n~\n\n0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~\nSyntax: buy   <object>\nSyntax: list\nSyntax: sell  <object>\nSyntax: value <object>\n\nBUY buys an object from a shop keeper.\nWhen multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n\nis the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two\nswords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of\nan item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into\n(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  \n\nBe careful!  Type carefully when buyign things.  If the shopkeeper thinks\nyou are trying to cheat him out of his wares by feeding him weird information,\nhe'll confiscate all your money.  Know the 'buy' command inside and out.\n\nLIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.\nList <name> shows you only objects of that name.\n\nSELL sells an object to a shop keeper.\n\nVALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.\n~\n\n0 SACRIFICE~\nSyntax: sacrifice <object>\n\nSACRIFICE offers an object to your deity, who may reward you.\nThe nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.\n~\n\n0 SCROLL~\nSyntax: scroll\nSyntax: scroll <number>\n\nThis command changes the number of lines the sled sends you in a page (the \ndefault is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen\nsizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.\n~\n\n0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~\nSyntax: brandish\nSyntax: quaff    <potion>\nSyntax: recite   <scroll> <target>\nSyntax: zap      <target>\nSyntax: zap\n\nBRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed\nto DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the\n<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a\nmagical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting\nsomeone, then that character is used for a target.\n\nYou must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.\n\nAll of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single\ncharge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no\nmore charges, it will be consumed.\n\nThese commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries\non the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.\n~\n\n0 CONSIDER~\nSyntax: consider <character>\n\nCONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.\nOf course, it's only a rough estimate.\n~\n\n0 FOLLOW GROUP~\nSyntax: follow <character>\nSyntax: group\nSyntax: group <character>\n\nFOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,\njust FOLLOW <yourself>.\n\nGROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.\nGroup members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and\nSPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically\njoin the fight.\n\nIf the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will\nkick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your\ngroup by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.\n\nGROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.\n\nYou may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of\nyour own.\n~\n\n0 VISIBLE~\nVISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,\nmaking you visible again.\n~\n\n0 QUIT RENT SAVE~\nSyntax: QUIT\nSyntax: RENT ... not!\nSyntax: SAVE\n\nSAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every\n15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save\nwill block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.\n(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)\n\nSome objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.\n\nQUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game \nyou will be back in the same room.\n\nQUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one\ncommand.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into\nthe habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other sled that\ndoesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.\n\nThere is no RENT in this sled.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.\n~\n\n0 RECALL /~\nSyntax: RECALL\n\nRECALL prays to your deity for miraculous transportation from where you are\nback to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.\n\nIf you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),\nand you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This\nchance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not \ninsure success.\n\nRECALL costs half of your movement points.\n\nRECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a\ncurse may not recall at all.\n~\n\n-1 SPLIT~\nSyntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>\n\nSPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your\ngroup who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT\nthe loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver\nthe split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).\nExamples:\nsplit 30 \t--> split 30 silver\nsplit 20 50\t--> split 20 silver, 50 gold\nsplit  0 10\t--> split 10 gold\n~\n\n-1 SNATCH~\nSyntax:  SNATCH <floating object> <character>\n\nSNATCH attempts to steal a character or mobs floating object.\nOnly those in the clan system may steal from other characters.\nIf you are caught snatching from another character, you will receive the\nTHIEF flag.  If you are caught snatching from a mob, they will attack\nyou.\n~\n-1 STEAL~\nSyntax: STEAL coins <character>\nSyntax: STEAL <object> <character>\n\nSTEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character or mob.\nObjects must be in the inventory of the target, you are not able to\nsteal items they are wearing (no one is that good).  Only those in the\nclan system may steal from other characters.\nIf you are caught stealing from another character, you will receive the\nTHIEF flag.  If you are caught stealing from a mob, they will attack\nyou.\n\n~\n\n0 PRACTICE~\nSyntax: PRACTICE\nSyntax: PRACTICE <-new|-skill|-spell|-old|-skip> <skill/spell name>\n\nPRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all\nthe skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.\n\nPRACTICE with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell. \nYour learning percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a maximum of 100%\nYou must be at a guild master to practice.\n\nPRACTICE -new will display your skills/spells less then 75%.\n\nPRACTICE -skills will display only your skills.\n\nPRACTICE -spells will display only your spells.\n\nPRACTICE -old with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up\nto your old skill % prior to Pfresh for a cost of 1 practice. If you are\nnot a pfresh character then this option is not useable.\n\nPRACTICE -skip with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up\nregularly, ignoring any old skill % prior to Pfresh.\n\nThe higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice\nsession.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will\nhave each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you\ndo use them.\n~\n\n0 TRAIN~\nSyntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana moves>\n\nTRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your\ncharacter has standard attributes based on your class, and several\ninitial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by\nusing these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).\n\nIt takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase\nmoves,mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.\n\nThe best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more\npractice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.\nIn the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train\nWIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.\n~\n57 FUCK~\nSyntax: fuck <character>\n\nFUCK is used on the more annoying players, and those that are spamming\nincessently.  The technicalities of the command will be spared, but it\ndoes basically what it says.  It is similar to the DISCONNECT command,\nbut has it's special twist.  Use this command to bide time or annoy an\nannoying user.  It should, in most cases, take them a bit to relog.\n~\n\n59 ADVANCE~\nSyntax: advance <character> <level>\n\nADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the\nonly way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE\nmay also be used to demote characters.\n~\n\n60 TRUST~\nSyntax: trust <character> <level>\n\nTRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to\nadvancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect\non combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or\nimmortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up\nthe character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their\nnatural level.\n\nA trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.\n~\n\n57 DNS UNDNS~\nSyntax: dns <IP or IP block>\n        undns <listed IP or IP block>\n\tdns\n\nDNS <IP or IP block> adds to a linked list of strings that are\nchecked against the IP of an incoming socket to see if it should\nbe looked up for an IP to name record (PTR).  The check uses a\nstr_prefix() comparison so partial blocks will work as well\nas full dotted quad IP's.\n\nRunning the command with no arguments shows the current list.\nThe 'undns' command removes the exact matching string from the list.\n\nTypos containing non-IP strings simply get skipped since they never\nmatch an IP or block.  But, typos should be removed.\n~\n\n58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~\nSyntax: allow   <site>\n\tban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>\n\tban\n\nBAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with\nno arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from\nthe ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.\n\nA site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set\nby editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.\n*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or \ncontent (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many\nsites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.\n~\n\n59 EQLIST~\nSyntax: eqlist <all|armor|weapons>\n\nEQLIST generates a flat file in /mud/moosehead/src called eqlist.eql (all),\narmor.eql (armor) or weapons.eql (weapons). The file contains a listing of\nthe equipment in a designated way for a PERL Script to parse into an online\nequipment list.\n~\n\n59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~\nSyntax: reboot\n\tshutdown\n\nReboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used\nto control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow\nold connections to die), followed by a reboot.\n\nShutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script\nfrom restarting it.\n\nNever, ever, shutdown the sled without consulting Rusty.\n~\n\n\n56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~\nSyntax: wizlock\n\tnewlock\n\nWizlock and newlock both block login attempts to MooseHead Sled. Wizlock locks\nout all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who\nare returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically\nused for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,\nand newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to Rusty and Creators.\n\nA god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.\n~\n\n59 DENY~\nSyntax: deny <name>\n\nDeny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character\nname unusable.  It may only be removed by having a 59 pload the character, so\nfreeze is usually preferred.\n~\n\n57 DISCONNECT~\nSyntax: disconnect <name>\n\nDisconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet\nprompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying\nplayers.\n~\n\n57 FREEZE~\nSyntax: freeze <name>\n\nFREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any\ncommands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a \ntroublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.\n~\n\n55 CTALK~\nSyntax: ctalk <clan> <message>\n\nCtalk lets an immortal speak on a clan channel without the need\nto guild themself into and out of the clan in question.  It also\nautomatically turns on LISTEN if it's off, so that you will hear\nany responses to your message.\n\nSEE ALSO:  listen\n~\n\n55 LISTEN~\nsyntax: listen\n\nListen is a toggle that allows you to turn on or off the ability\nto listen in on clan channels.  If on, any communication done over\na clan channel is also printed out to you, along with a header\ndenoting the clan channel it came across.\n~\n\n53 FORCE~\nSyntax: force <character> <command>\nSyntax: force all <command>\n\nFORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.\n\nBelow level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is\nunavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. \n\nFORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.\nThis is typically used for 'force all save'.\n~\n\n57 FUCK~\n'Fuck' is a command that starts a Zmodem download on that players side,\nthereby dumping him/her, and basically 'fuck'ing up their connection and\nterminal.  Sometimes, it will have devestating affects, sometimes, it will\nonly be as good as a 'disconnect'.\n~\n\n56 SOCKETS~\nSyntax: sockets\n\tsockets <name> \n\nSOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including \nusers in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the \nchannel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in \nmerc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.\n\nThe optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used\nto identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched\ninto an orc).\n~\n58 HOSTMASK~\nSyntax: hostmask <password> <string> <character>\n\nNOTE:  THE CHARACTER YOU ARE HOSTMASKING *MUST* BE CONNECTED!!!\n       If you try to hostmask a ploaded or link dead character\n       you WILL crash the game.\n\nHostmask allows you to mask the ip address of the socket you are coming \nin on.  This can be usefull if you do not want others to know who your \nmorts are.\n\n~\n56 LOAD~\nSyntax: load mob <vnum>\n\tload obj <vnum> <level>\n\nThe load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to \nduplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum\ncommand, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.\n\nLoad puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are\nput in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old\nformat objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new\nformat objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.\n(see also clone, vnum, stat)\n~\n55 FLAG~\nFLAG is used to set mob and character flags\nSyntax:\nflag mob  <name> <field> <flags>\n     mob  flags: act,aff,off,imm,res,vuln,form,part\n\nflag char <name> <field> <flags>\n     char flags: plr,comm,aff,imm,res,vuln,mhs\n\n+: add flag, -: remove flag, = set equal to otherwise flag toggles the flags\nlisted.\n\nPlayer Flags ( plr )\nnpc           autoassist     autoexit        autoloot,\nautosac       autogold       autosplit       honor\ncircle        demise         balance         loner\nholylight     can_loot       nosummon        nofollow\npermit        dweeb          log             deny\nfreeze        thief          killer\n\nCommunication flags ( comm )\nquiet         deaf           nowiz           noclangossip\nnogossip      noooc          noquestion      nomusic\nnoclan        noquest        nograts         noemote\nnoshout       noshout        notell          nochannels\nnonotes       snoop_proof    afk\n\nAffect Flags ( aff )\nTo add a flag:    flag char <name> plr +: <flag> \nTo remove a flag: flag char <name> plr -: <flag> \nblind         invisible      detect_evil     detect_invis\ndetect_magic  detect_hidden  detect_good     sanctuary\nfaerie_fire   infrared       curse           poison\nprotect_evil  protect_good   sneak           hide\nsleep         charm          flying          pass_door\nhaste         calm\n\nImmunityFlags ( imm ) ResistanceFlags (res) VulnFlags (vuln)\nThese flags are all used to set immunities, resistances and \nvulns.\nsummon        charm          magic           weapon\nbash          pierce         slash           fire\ncold          lightning      acid            poison\nnegative      holy           energy          mental\ndisease       drowning       light           sound\nwood          silver         iron      \n~\n\n58 SET~\nSyntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>\n\tset obj   <object> <field> <value>\n\tset room  <number> <field> <value>\n\tset skill <char>   <name>  <rating>\n\tset skill <char>   all     <rating>\n\nThe set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data\nstructures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.\nSet skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value\ngiven.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.\n(see also string, stat)\n~\n\n55 STRING~\nSyntax: string obj <field> <string>\n\tstring mob <field> <string>\n\nThe string command changes the various strings associated with an object or\nmobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string\nmob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.\nWhen doing a restring here are some rules:\n*You may not restring an item so that it's name, short, or long\nmatch an existing item in the game.  Always vnum what they are\nasking for to see if it is an item in the game.\n\nExample of  Bad Restrings:\nan assassin's quiver restrung to a pair of black dragon scale leggings\na portable hole restrung to a gnomish sword\n\nExample of Ok Restrings:\nan assassin's quiver restrung to a dragon scale pouch\na portable hole restrung to a vat of gumbo\n\nThe assassin's quiver is a container, a dragon scale pouch leads \npeople to believe it is a container.  Hence, that would be an ok\nrestring.\n*All words in the name must appear in the short and long descriptions\n\nGenerally, morts will say \"i want this to be called joes big gun\"\nIt is up to you to make sure that \"joes big gun\" appears in the short\nand long description.\n\nExample of a Bad Restring:\nOrigional Item:  rangers backpack\nNew Name:        my secret hidey hole bag\nNew Short:       rangers backpack\nNew Long:        A rangers backpack lies here.\n\nThe above would be a very very very bad restring.  \n\nExample of a Good Restring:\nOrigional Item:  rangers backpack\nwhat the mort wants:  my secret hidey hole bag\nNew Name:        my secret hidey hole bag his\nNew Short:       his serect hidey hole bag\nNew Long:        My secret hidey hole bag lies here.\n\nThe short is different so it looks \"cool\" when they take things\nout of the bag they say.  So, it is up to you to make sure that\n\"my\" appears in the name of the item.\n----------\n*Always get permission before putting other people's names in \na restring.\n\nIf you have any questions about this, please ask an admin\n\n~\n\n55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~\nSyntax: nochannel <character>\n\tnoemote   <character>\n\tnoshout   <character>\n\tnotell    <character>\n\nNoemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by\npreventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.\nCharacters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those\nforms of communication.\n\nThe nochannel command is similar, but more drastic.

You can replace these messages with messages of\nyour own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages\nmust include your name somewhere in the string.\n\nPoofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.\n(see also goto)\n~\n\n59 PROTECT~\nSyntax: protect <character>\n\nProtect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing \nprotected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.\n~\n\n58 REWARD~\nSyntax: reward <character> <amount of XP>\n\nThe reward command is used to give experience points to players in\ninstances where they either win it through a quest, or you feel they\nare owed it due to an IMM mistake.

Conversely, certain\ncommands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.\n\nLog all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not\npersist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell Rusty.\n\n\nSnoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.\nThe character must have an open channel.

You will be asked to provide the short\ndescription and long description (and in some cases the keywords, or name)\nof the item. The keywords you choose must be in both the long and short\ndescriptions you provide.\n\nA short description is what you see when and item is in a shop, being worn,\nor in your inventory.  A long description is what you see when an item is\neither examined/looked at, or on the ground.\n\nFor example:\nshort description: a sub issue shield\nlong description: You see a sub issue shield here.\nkeywors: sub issue shield   \n\n\n1)    The keywords you choose *MUST* exist in both the long and short\n      descriptions.  If there is more than one key, you may have one\n      key in the short description, and a different one in the long\n      description, so long both long and short have a keyword in them.\n\n2)    Several different objects may not be restrung with the exact same\n      name.  This means at the same time or over time.  Objects found to\n      be intentionally restrung with duplicate names will be confiscated.\n\n3)    You may not include the name of another character in the restring\n      of an item without the express consent of that character.\n\n4)    Containers must be restrung to something that resembles a container\n      in some fashion.  Be creative, but no restringing \"a bag\" into \"a\n      shoe\".\n\n5)    There is no discount for multiple restrings at the same time.  The\n      pricing listed above is very reasonable. \n\nWhen an Immortal does a restring for you it is polite to pay attention to\nwhat they are saying and it is always a good idea to know what you want\nbefore you ask for a restring (unless you have prior arrangements with that\nimmortal), to avoid causing an Immortal unnecessary trouble.  If you follow\nthe directions given above your experiences with recieving restrings should\nbe wonderful, memorable experiences.\n~\n52 STARTGLAD~\nStartglad is used to start Gladiator events.\nSyntax:\nstartglad <type> <min level> <max level> <ticks till start> <blind/noblind> <ticks till end>\n\nType has to be one of the following:\n     1 - Singles Event\n     2 - Random Teams Event  \n     3 - Assigned Teams Event \n\nLevels have to be between one and sixty.\nTicks till start has to be at least three.\nBlind will hide the names of the other gladiators.\nNoblind will show the gladiators thier opponents Names.\n~\n52 ENDGLAD~\nEndglad is used to end Gladiator events.\nSyntax:\nendglad <victor's name/none>\n\nYou may have the victor of the event announed by passing it to endglad\nor you may say none if no one won.\n~\n52 REMOVEGLAD~\nRemoveglad is used to remove a player from the event.

All you\nneed to do, is:\n1.  Announce intent with the support of 1 /4.  (If you are\na /4, thats fine, support of any other member is acceptable.\n2.  A vote will be held, winner takes all.  If there is a tie\nthen it is settled by dual.\n3.  Anyone guilded within 2 weeks of the Mutiny is NOT permitted\na vote.\n4.  The loser will be required to leave all EQ behind.  This is\nso the leader (Whom may be holding clan funds) doesn't make\nit out the door and screw the clan.  It will be up to the\nwinner to return any other gear.  (which would follow charter)\n\nDEMISE:\n\nTo mutiny in Demise, you need to have five supporters who\nare different characters, and you must organize the mutiny\nin seret, posting the mutiny note to Demise and the immortals\nonce the supporters, one of which must be a /4, have been\narranged.  Otherwise, the current leader is entitled to \noutcast you at any time prior to the public posting.\nIn addition, you yourself must have been in Demise for\na period of two months, not necessairly consecutive months\nprovided you didn't join any other clan if you were a loner\nat some point.  Once these requirements have been satisified,\na duel will take place in which each side may declare a champion\nto fight in their place.  The winning side becomes the leader.\n\nHONOR:\n\nAny Mutineer must have attained the rank of /2 or above and have at\nleast 5 supporters, those of rank /3 only require 4 supporers, and\nthose of rank /4 only require 3 supporters. He must then post a note \ndeclaring the mutiny that includes character info, mutiny reasons and \nthe names of his supporters.  If this is done, and the supporters are \nverified,1 week of voting will commence. An immortal will count the \nvotes. No recruiting will take place during the week of voting.  Voting \nwith alts will disqualify a person's votes.  The mutineer and /5's may \nnot vote.The loser of the mutiny will be ranked /1 and will hand over all\nvaluables to the victor.\n\nPOSSE:\n\nIf you wish to challenge for leadership, it works as a simple\nmajority vote. In order to be elligible you must first gain \nsupport from at least 3 other posse members.Once you have \nnecessary support, the election begins. Majority wins.\nThe parties involved (being the Leader challenged and the \nchallenger) can not vote.\n\nWARLOCK:\n\nMajority Vote was method used in past, so as it stands that \nis the policy. An Imm would be asked to tally votes.\nMutineer would post cnote to 'Warlock Immortal' declaring mutiny\nand giving name of IMM to post your vote to.\n(so votes can be anonymous) 7 days from post date, vote is tallied, \nwinner is /5 looser is outcast.\n\nZEALOT:\n\nTo mutiny in Zealot, the mutineer must be a rank /4, and have the\nsupport of at least 5 other members who have been ranked above /0\nand who have been in the clan for at least one month's time.\nThe Anointed then has the choice to either settle the dispute\nvia a duel, or a clan vote.\nIf a duel is called for, an IMM will supervise on a preset date which\nwill be at least one week after the mutiny was called. The duel will\nbe to the death, with no charmies. Cheaters will lose automatically.\nIf the Anointed does not wish to duel, he or she may call for a\nclan vote, which shall last for a period of one week. During that\ntime, all /4s shall be reduced to /0 until the vote is decided, or\none of the contesting parties withdraws.\n\nThe loser of either contest will be at the winner's discretion.\n\n~\n\n\n-1 hlab~\n\nThe Infamous Prefresh\n\nQ. What is it?\nA. The prefresh is short for \"player refresh\".  It is a process by which all\ncurrent player files (the file that contains the data about your character in\nfixed storage) and updated to the current MHS game code.\n\nQ. How often will we do this?\nA. If we do it right and make changes correectly, once and once only.\n\nQ. How will I know when I am being prefreshed?\nA. You will be given a 10-day advanced warning before we do it.  We will also\nrun a handful of tests that players can volunteer to put themselves through\nto make sure there are no bugs.\n\nQ. What will happen to my character when I prefresh?\nA. When the day arrives you will log in and the game will detect that your\ncharacter is not marked as being prefreshed already.  You'll be put into a\nsort of secondary creation mode.  You will be told that you need to prefresh\nand an image of your player file will be backed up to a special directory just\nin case something goes wrong.  The game will store in a special data structure\na copy of your important data, and then you'll have to select which method of\nprefresh you want to use.  You'll be guided through the process from there.\n\nQ. What are my options?\nA. Option #1 is the Standard Prefresh.  What happens is that your character\nis set to level 1 and you go to the alignment selection screen.  You pick your\nalignment, and then you to the stat customization screen.  Once that is done,\nyou are put back into the game at level 1, and your skills will all default\nback to their original values.  When you type \"score\", you'll see that you\nhave an item called \"debit levels\".  You may use these at any time to level.\n\n\n~\n\n-1 DIKU~\n.

Here are all the damage verbs listed from\nleast damage to most damage:\n\nclumsy/miss            skillful/harm               OBLITERATES\nclumsy/bruise          skillful/devastating        MASSACRES\nwobbly/scrape          cunning/shredding flesh     ERADICATES\namateur/scratch        strong/spurt blood\namateur/light wds      calculated/GAPING hole\namateur/bleeds         DISEMBOWELS\ncompetent/organ        DISMEMBERS\ncompetent/gasp         ANNIHILATES\n\nAnd, at the far reaches of damaging power, you can do unspeakable things.\n\nThe keywords for spells are slightly different:\n\n    miss        wound           MUTILATE        DEMOLISH\n    scratch     maul            DISEMBOWEL      DEVASTATE\n    graze       decimate        DISMEMBER\tOBLITERATE\n    hit         devastate       MASSACRE\tANNIHILATE\n    injure      maim  \t\tMANGLE\t\tERADICATE\n\nAnd, of course, the unspeakable.\n~\n\n0 TOASTS~\nToast messages now give an indicator as to how badly the victim was creamed\nby his killer, based on the percentage of remaining hitpoints of the killer.\n\nToast Message  \t\t\t    Killer's HP\n----------                          -----------\nSlodhian got slaughtered by Boogums.  \t( 100% +  )\nNightdagger got crushed by a snail.

( < 10%   )\n~\n\n0 DEATH~\nWhen your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple\nof Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,\ntogether with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you (IMMs want \nyou to have your gold).\n\nAny spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.\n\nFollowing and groups are not affected by death.\n\nYou lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of \nthe way back to the beginning of your level.\n\nCorpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.\nPlayer corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).\nOnly the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects\nfrom a player's corpse, unless that person who died was clanned, in which case\ntheir corpse is free for the looting by another clanned player.\n\n~\n\n\n\n0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~\nYour character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set \namount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.\n\nYou gain experience by:\n    \n    killing a player or creature\n    being part of a group that kills a monster\n    participating in a quest that gives experience as a reward\n\nYou lose experience by:\n\n    fleeing from combat\n    recalling out of combat\n    being the target of certain spells\n    dying\n\nThe experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players\nare in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment\nversus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed\nlately; and some random variation.\n~\n\n\n\n0 PET PETS~\nYou can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after \nthe old one dies you may purchase a replacement.  \n\nbuy <pet type> <name>\n\n~\n\n\n\n0 TICK~\nMany of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,\nmost autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,\nweather, and area resetting.\n\nOf these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the\n'tick'.  Ticks on this sled average 45 seconds of real time, but the actual\namount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.\n\nArea resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less\noften (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground\nwill not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.\n~\n\n\n\n0 !~\nSyntax: !\n\n! repeats the last command you typed.\n~\n\n0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~\nSyntax: north\nSyntax: south\nSyntax: east\nSyntax: west\nSyntax: up\nSyntax: down\n\nUse these commands to walk in a particular direction.\n~\n\n0 CAST~\nSyntax: cast <spell> <target>\n\nBefore you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,\nthe higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.\nThe mana cost decreases as your level increases.\n\nThe <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an\nappropriate default target, especially during combat.\n\nIf the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.\nExample: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.\nYou can abbreviate the spell name.\n\nWhen you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.\nThe effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the\nsaving throw successfully.\n\nSee also the help sections for individual spells.\n~\n\n0 EXITS~\nSyntax: exits\n\nTells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.\nYou can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a\ncertain direction and see what you bump into).\n~\n\n0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~\nSyntax: drop <object>\nSyntax: drop <amount> coins\nSyntax: get  <object>\nSyntax: get  <object> <container>\nSyntax: give <object> <character>\nSyntax: give <amount> coins <character>\nSyntax: put  <object> <container>\n\nDROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.\n\nGET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even\nfrom a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.\n\nGIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.\n\nPUT puts an object into a container.\n\nDROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and\n'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.\n~\n\n0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~\nSyntax: equipment\nSyntax: inventory\n\nEQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).\nINVENTORY lists your inventory.\n~\n\n0 COMPARE~\nSyntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>\nSyntax: compare <object>\n \nCOMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,\nit will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are\narmor, it will report the one with the better armor class.\n \nCOMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object\nyou are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.\n \nCOMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.\n~\n\n0 FLEE~\nSyntax: flee\nSyntax: rescue   <character>\n\nOnce you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight\nis not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can\nRESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,\nand costs more experience points, then fleeing).\n\nIf you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep\nfighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances\nof making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.\n~\n\n0 EXAMINE LOOK~\nSyntax: look\nSyntax: look    <object>\nSyntax: look    <character>\nSyntax: look    <direction>\nSyntax: look    <keyword>\nSyntax: look in <container>\nSyntax: look in <corpse>\nSyntax: examine <container>\nSyntax: examine <corpse>\n\nLOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.\n\nEXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.\n~\n\n0 ORDER~\nSyntax: order <character> command\nSyntax: order all command\n\nORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to\nperform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible\nfor the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers\nwill incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.\n\nMost charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).\n\nIf your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.\n~\n\n0 SLEEP~\nSyntax: cast 'sleep' <victim>\n\nThis spell puts its victim to sleep.\n~\n\n0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~\nSyntax: rest\nSyntax: sleep\nSyntax: stand\nSyntax: wake\n\nThese commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you \nregenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.\nHowever, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,\nyou won't hear many things happen.\n\nUse STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can\nalso WAKE other sleeping characters.\n~\n\n0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~\nSyntax: gtell <message>\nSyntax: say   <message>\nSyntax: tell  <character> <message>\n\nAll of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to\nall of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are\nsleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.\n\nSAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''\nis a synonym for SAY.\n\nTELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.\n\nREPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work\neven if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This\nis handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.\n~\n-1 SLED~\nA SLED is a Slightly Liquid Earthy Dementia.\n~\n\n-1 NOTE NOTES SPOOL BUG CHANGE NEWS INOTE ONOTE CNOTE GNOTE IDEA QNOTE~\nThe notes on MHS replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many\nother sleds.  There are several types of notes including In-Character notes \n(inotes), Out-of-Character Notes(onotes), Bug Notes (bug), Quest Notes (qnotes) \nand God Notes (gnote). \nThe following options are usable(in this case, an inote is used as an example, for other types of notes, simply replace inote with the appropriate type of note):\n\nreading notes:\ninote list\t: show all inotes (unread notes are marked with an N)\ninote read\t: either by number, or read next to read unread inotes\ninote remove\t: removes an inote that you wrote or are the target of\ninote catchup\t: markes all inotes as read\nspool           : Catches up all notes of all types\nunread          : Lists notes that have not been read by this character\n\nwriting new notes:\ninote to\t: sets the to line (name, clanname, 'clans', immortal, or all)\ninote subject\t: sets the subject for a new inote\ninote +\t\t: adds a line to a new inote (i.e. inote + hi guys!)\ninote -\t\t: remove a line from an inote in progress\ninote clear\t: erase an inote in progress\nnote show\t: shows the inote you are working on\ninote post\t: posts a new inote. This MUST be done to post an inote.\n\nWhen you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type\nnote read to scroll through them one at a time.\n\nFour other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, and \npenalties (gods only).  They are used the exact same way, for example\nidea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards is\nrestricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on\nall the note spools.\n\n~\n0 GOSSIP CGOSSIP . SHOUT YELL~\nSyntax: gossip  <message>\nSyntax: cgossip <message>\nSyntax: yell    <message>\n\nGOSSIP and CGOSSIP send messages to all plays who are listening to the \nchannel.  The '.' is a shortened version of the GOSSIP command. \n\nYELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.\n\nType a channel name by itself to turn it off.\n~\n\n0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~\nSyntax: emote <action>\nSyntax: pose\n\nEMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are\nseveral dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK\n(type socials or help socials for a listing).\n\nPMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's\nname (i.e. pmote bonks Rusty will be read as bonks you by Rusty, and as \nbonks Rusty by everyone else).\n\nPOSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.\n~\n\n52 SMOTE~\nSyntax: smote <action>\n\nSmote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in\nthe string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.\n~\n\n0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~\nSyntax: hold   <object>\nSyntax: remove <object>\nSyntax: wear   <object>\nSyntax: wear   all\nSyntax: wield  <object>\n\nThree of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using\nit as equipment.

So if there are two\nswords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of\nan item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into\n(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.  \n\nBe careful!  Type carefully when buyign things.  If the shopkeeper thinks\nyou are trying to cheat him out of his wares by feeding him weird information,\nhe'll confiscate all your money.  Know the 'buy' command inside and out.\n\nLIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.\nList <name> shows you only objects of that name.\n\nSELL sells an object to a shop keeper.\n\nVALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.\n~\n\n0 SACRIFICE~\nSyntax: sacrifice <object>\n\nSACRIFICE offers an object to your deity, who may reward you.\nThe nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.\n~\n\n0 SCROLL~\nSyntax: scroll\nSyntax: scroll <number>\n\nThis command changes the number of lines the sled sends you in a page (the \ndefault is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen\nsizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.\n~\n\n0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~\nSyntax: brandish\nSyntax: quaff    <potion>\nSyntax: recite   <scroll> <target>\nSyntax: zap      <target>\nSyntax: zap\n\nBRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed\nto DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the\n<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a\nmagical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting\nsomeone, then that character is used for a target.\n\nYou must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.\n\nAll of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single\ncharge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no\nmore charges, it will be consumed.\n\nThese commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries\non the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.\n~\n\n0 CONSIDER~\nSyntax: consider <character>\n\nCONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.\nOf course, it's only a rough estimate.\n~\n\n0 FOLLOW GROUP~\nSyntax: follow <character>\nSyntax: group\nSyntax: group <character>\n\nFOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,\njust FOLLOW <yourself>.\n\nGROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.\nGroup members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and\nSPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically\njoin the fight.\n\nIf the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will\nkick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your\ngroup by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.\n\nGROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.\n\nYou may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of\nyour own.\n~\n\n0 VISIBLE~\nVISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,\nmaking you visible again.\n~\n\n0 QUIT RENT SAVE~\nSyntax: QUIT\nSyntax: RENT ... not!\nSyntax: SAVE\n\nSAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every\n15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save\nwill block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.\n(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)\n\nSome objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.\n\nQUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game \nyou will be back in the same room.\n\nQUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one\ncommand.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into\nthe habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other sled that\ndoesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.\n\nThere is no RENT in this sled.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.\n~\n\n0 RECALL /~\nSyntax: RECALL\n\nRECALL prays to your deity for miraculous transportation from where you are\nback to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.\n\nIf you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),\nand you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This\nchance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not \ninsure success.\n\nRECALL costs half of your movement points.\n\nRECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a\ncurse may not recall at all.\n~\n\n-1 SPLIT~\nSyntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>\n\nSPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your\ngroup who are in the same room as you.

Only those in the\nclan system may steal from other characters.\nIf you are caught stealing from another character, you will receive the\nTHIEF flag.  If you are caught stealing from a mob, they will attack\nyou.\n\n~\n\n0 PRACTICE~\nSyntax: PRACTICE\nSyntax: PRACTICE <-new|-skill|-spell|-old|-skip> <skill/spell name>\n\nPRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all\nthe skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.\n\nPRACTICE with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell. \nYour learning percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a maximum of 100%\nYou must be at a guild master to practice.\n\nPRACTICE -new will display your skills/spells less then 75%.\n\nPRACTICE -skills will display only your skills.\n\nPRACTICE -spells will display only your spells.\n\nPRACTICE -old with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up\nto your old skill % prior to Pfresh for a cost of 1 practice. If you are\nnot a pfresh character then this option is not useable.\n\nPRACTICE -skip with a skill/spell name practices that skill or spell up\nregularly, ignoring any old skill % prior to Pfresh.\n\nThe higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice\nsession.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will\nhave each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you\ndo use them.\n~\n\n0 TRAIN~\nSyntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana moves>\n\nTRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your\ncharacter has standard attributes based on your class, and several\ninitial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by\nusing these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).\n\nIt takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase\nmoves,mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.\n\nThe best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more\npractice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.\nIn the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train\nWIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.\n~\n57 FUCK~\nSyntax: fuck <character>\n\nFUCK is used on the more annoying players, and those that are spamming\nincessently.  The technicalities of the command will be spared, but it\ndoes basically what it says.  It is similar to the DISCONNECT command,\nbut has it's special twist.  Use this command to bide time or annoy an\nannoying user.  It should, in most cases, take them a bit to relog.\n~\n\n59 ADVANCE~\nSyntax: advance <character> <level>\n\nADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the\nonly way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE\nmay also be used to demote characters.\n~\n\n60 TRUST~\nSyntax: trust <character> <level>\n\nTRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to\nadvancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect\non combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or\nimmortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up\nthe character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their\nnatural level.\n\nA trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.\n~\n\n57 DNS UNDNS~\nSyntax: dns <IP or IP block>\n        undns <listed IP or IP block>\n\tdns\n\nDNS <IP or IP block> adds to a linked list of strings that are\nchecked against the IP of an incoming socket to see if it should\nbe looked up for an IP to name record (PTR).  The check uses a\nstr_prefix() comparison so partial blocks will work as well\nas full dotted quad IP's.\n\nRunning the command with no arguments shows the current list.\nThe 'undns' command removes the exact matching string from the list.\n\nTypos containing non-IP strings simply get skipped since they never\nmatch an IP or block.  But, typos should be removed.\n~\n\n58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~\nSyntax: allow   <site>\n\tban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>\n\tban\n\nBAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with\nno arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from\nthe ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.\n\nA site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set\nby editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.\n*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or \ncontent (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many\nsites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.\n~\n\n59 EQLIST~\nSyntax: eqlist <all|armor|weapons>\n\nEQLIST generates a flat file in /mud/moosehead/src called eqlist.eql (all),\narmor.eql (armor) or weapons.eql (weapons). The file contains a listing of\nthe equipment in a designated way for a PERL Script to parse into an online\nequipment list.\n~\n\n59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~\nSyntax: reboot\n\tshutdown\n\nReboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used\nto control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow\nold connections to die), followed by a reboot.\n\nShutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script\nfrom restarting it.\n\nNever, ever, shutdown the sled without consulting Rusty.\n~\n\n\n56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~\nSyntax: wizlock\n\tnewlock\n\nWizlock and newlock both block login attempts to MooseHead Sled. Wizlock locks\nout all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who\nare returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically\nused for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,\nand newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to Rusty and Creators.\n\nA god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.\n~\n\n59 DENY~\nSyntax: deny <name>\n\nDeny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character\nname unusable.  It may only be removed by having a 59 pload the character, so\nfreeze is usually preferred.\n~\n\n57 DISCONNECT~\nSyntax: disconnect <name>\n\nDisconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet\nprompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying\nplayers.\n~\n\n57 FREEZE~\nSyntax: freeze <name>\n\nFREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any\ncommands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a \ntroublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.\n~\n\n55 CTALK~\nSyntax: ctalk <clan> <message>\n\nCtalk lets an immortal speak on a clan channel without the need\nto guild themself into and out of the clan in question.  It also\nautomatically turns on LISTEN if it's off, so that you will hear\nany responses to your message.\n\nSEE ALSO:  listen\n~\n\n55 LISTEN~\nsyntax: listen\n\nListen is a toggle that allows you to turn on or off the ability\nto listen in on clan channels.  If on, any communication done over\na clan channel is also printed out to you, along with a header\ndenoting the clan channel it came across.\n~\n\n53 FORCE~\nSyntax: force <character> <command>\nSyntax: force all <command>\n\nFORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.\n\nBelow level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is\nunavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. \n\nFORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.\nThis is typically used for 'force all save'.\n~\n\n57 FUCK~\n'Fuck' is a command that starts a Zmodem download on that players side,\nthereby dumping him/her, and basically 'fuck'ing up their connection and\nterminal.  Sometimes, it will have devestating affects, sometimes, it will\nonly be as good as a 'disconnect'.\n~\n\n56 SOCKETS~\nSyntax: sockets\n\tsockets <name> \n\nSOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including \nusers in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the \nchannel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in \nmerc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.\n\nThe optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used\nto identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched\ninto an orc).\n~\n58 HOSTMASK~\nSyntax: hostmask <password> <string> <character>\n\nNOTE:  THE CHARACTER YOU ARE HOSTMASKING *MUST* BE CONNECTED!!!\n       If you try to hostmask a ploaded or link dead character\n       you WILL crash the game.\n\nHostmask allows you to mask the ip address of the socket you are coming \nin on.  This can be usefull if you do not want others to know who your \nmorts are.\n\n~\n56 LOAD~\nSyntax: load mob <vnum>\n\tload obj <vnum> <level>\n\nThe load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to \nduplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum\ncommand, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.\n\nLoad puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are\nput in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old\nformat objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new\nformat objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.\n(see also clone, vnum, stat)\n~\n55 FLAG~\nFLAG is used to set mob and character flags\nSyntax:\nflag mob  <name> <field> <flags>\n     mob  flags: act,aff,off,imm,res,vuln,form,part\n\nflag char <name> <field> <flags>\n     char flags: plr,comm,aff,imm,res,vuln,mhs\n\n+: add flag, -: remove flag, = set equal to otherwise flag toggles the flags\nlisted.\n\nPlayer Flags ( plr )\nnpc           autoassist     autoexit        autoloot,\nautosac       autogold       autosplit       honor\ncircle        demise         balance         loner\nholylight     can_loot       nosummon        nofollow\npermit        dweeb          log             deny\nfreeze        thief          killer\n\nCommunication flags ( comm )\nquiet         deaf           nowiz           noclangossip\nnogossip      noooc          noquestion      nomusic\nnoclan        noquest        nograts         noemote\nnoshout       noshout        notell          nochannels\nnonotes       snoop_proof    afk\n\nAffect Flags ( aff )\nTo add a flag:    flag char <name> plr +: <flag> \nTo remove a flag: flag char <name> plr -: <flag> \nblind         invisible      detect_evil     detect_invis\ndetect_magic  detect_hidden  detect_good     sanctuary\nfaerie_fire   infrared       curse           poison\nprotect_evil  protect_good   sneak           hide\nsleep         charm          flying          pass_door\nhaste         calm\n\nImmunityFlags ( imm ) ResistanceFlags (res) VulnFlags (vuln)\nThese flags are all used to set immunities, resistances and \nvulns.\nsummon        charm          magic           weapon\nbash          pierce         slash           fire\ncold          lightning      acid            poison\nnegative      holy           energy          mental\ndisease       drowning       light           sound\nwood          silver         iron      \n~\n\n58 SET~\nSyntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>\n\tset obj   <object> <field> <value>\n\tset room  <number> <field> <value>\n\tset skill <char>   <name>  <rating>\n\tset skill <char>   all     <rating>\n\nThe set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data\nstructures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.\nSet skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value\ngiven.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.\n(see also string, stat)\n~\n\n55 STRING~\nSyntax: string obj <field> <string>\n\tstring mob <field> <string>\n\nThe string command changes the various strings associated with an object or\nmobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string\nmob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.\nWhen doing a restring here are some rules:\n*You may not restring an item so that it's name, short, or long\nmatch an existing item in the game.  Always vnum what they are\nasking for to see if it is an item in the game.\n\nExample of  Bad Restrings:\nan assassin's quiver restrung to a pair of black dragon scale leggings\na portable hole restrung to a gnomish sword\n\nExample of Ok Restrings:\nan assassin's quiver restrung to a dragon scale pouch\na portable hole restrung to a vat of gumbo\n\nThe assassin's quiver is a container, a dragon scale pouch leads \npeople to believe it is a container.  Hence, that would be an ok\nrestring.\n*All words in the name must appear in the short and long descriptions\n\nGenerally, morts will say \"i want this to be called joes big gun\"\nIt is up to you to make sure that \"joes big gun\" appears in the short\nand long description.\n\nExample of a Bad Restring:\nOrigional Item:  rangers backpack\nNew Name:        my secret hidey hole bag\nNew Short:       rangers backpack\nNew Long:        A rangers backpack lies here.\n\nThe above would be a very very very bad restring.  \n\nExample of a Good Restring:\nOrigional Item:  rangers backpack\nwhat the mort wants:  my secret hidey hole bag\nNew Name:        my secret hidey hole bag his\nNew Short:       his serect hidey hole bag\nNew Long:        My secret hidey hole bag lies here.\n\nThe short is different so it looks \"cool\" when they take things\nout of the bag they say.  So, it is up to you to make sure that\n\"my\" appears in the name of the item.\n----------\n*Always get permission before putting other people's names in \na restring.\n\nIf you have any questions about this, please ask an admin\n\n~\n\n55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~\nSyntax: nochannel <character>\n\tnoemote   <character>\n\tnoshout   <character>\n\tnotell    <character>\n\nNoemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by\npreventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.\nCharacters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those\nforms of communication.\n\nThe nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim\nfrom using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.\nNochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.\n~\n\n57 PARDON~\nSyntax: pardon <character> killer\n\tpardon <character> thief\n\nPardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you\nare sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic\npardon.\n~\n\n56 PURGE~\nSyntax: purge\n\tpurge <character>\n\nPurge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the\nNPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one\ncharacter from anywhere in the world.\n\nPurge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag\nset (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be\npurged if they are called directly by name.\n~\n\n56 RESTORE~\nSyntax: restore <character>\n\trestore room\n\trestore all\n\trestore nonclan\n\nRestore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the\ntarget character.

Best not to use this\ncommand on players if you enjoy being a god.\n~\n\n55 TRANSFER TELEPORT~\nSyntax: transfer <character>\n\ttransfer all\n\ttransfer <character> <location>\n\ttransfer all         <location>\n\nTransfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,\nto your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all \nshould almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have\nhorrible effects on slow links.

The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of\na mobile, or as the name of an object.\n\nAt works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the\ncommand, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your\nlocation).\n~\n\n54 ECHO GECHO PECHO ZECHO~\nSyntax: echo  <message>\n\tgecho <message>\n\tpecho <character> <message>\n\nThese commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to\nall characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent\nit.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho\nsends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level\ngod will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it\nis an echo.  Zecho is an echo throughout the entire current area.\n~\n\n52 GOTO~\nSyntax: goto <location>\n\nGoto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,\nas the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.\n\nYou may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters\nalready present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters\nalready present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain\ngod level.\n\nImplementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.\n~\n52 SKSTAT~\nSyntax: skstat <player>\n\nSkstat will show you the targets skills and the percents they are at.\n\n~\n\n52 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~\nSyntax: holylight\n\twiznvis <level>\n\nHolylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and\nmobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more\neasily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.\n\nWizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of\na lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum\n(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally \ninvisible.\n~\n\n52 INCOGNITO~\nToggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the\nroom you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes\na level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see\nyou regarless of location.\n~ \n\n52 MEMORY~\nSyntax: memory\n\nMemory reports the size of your sled.\n\nThe 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,\nnot the number of instances currently in the game.\n\nThe 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.

Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is\nvery useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and\nthe slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.\n(see also load)\n~\n\n53 STAT~\nSyntax: stat <name>\n\tstat mob  <name>\n\tstat obj  <name>\n\tstat room <number>\n\nThe stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room\nwithin the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object\n(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room \n(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are\nstanding in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.\n(see also goto, transfer)\n~\n\n53 MWHERE~\nSyntax: mwhere <name>\n\nMwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.\n~\n\n55 PEACE~\nSyntax: peace\n\nPeace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the\nAGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.\n~\n\n52 POOFIN POOFOUT~\nSyntax: poofin  <message>\nSyntax: pooffout <message>\n\nThe standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and\n'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of\nyour own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.

Removing \nprotected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.\n~\n\n58 REWARD~\nSyntax: reward <character> <amount of XP>\n\nThe reward command is used to give experience points to players in\ninstances where they either win it through a quest, or you feel they\nare owed it due to an IMM mistake.  Please use sparingly.\n\n~\n\n55 LOG SNOOP~\nSyntax: log   <character>\n\tlog   all\n\tsnoop <character>\n\nLog <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into\nthe server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.\nLogs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied\nby mail to Rusty.  \n\nCertain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain\ncommands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.\n\nLog all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not\npersist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell Rusty.\n\n\nSnoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.\nThe character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one\ncharacter at a time. Try to respect privacy.\n\nSnoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.\n~\n\n54 SWITCH RETURN~\nSyntax: switch <character>\n\treturn\n\nSwitch switches you into the body of another character (who must not\nalready have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC).

You will be asked to provide the short\ndescription and long description (and in some cases the keywords, or name)\nof the item. The keywords you choose must be in both the long and short\ndescriptions you provide.\n\nA short description is what you see when and item is in a shop, being worn,\nor in your inventory.  A long description is what you see when an item is\neither examined/looked at, or on the ground.\n\nFor example:\nshort description: a sub issue shield\nlong description: You see a sub issue shield here.\nkeywors: sub issue shield   \n\n\n1)    The keywords you choose *MUST* exist in both the long and short\n      descriptions.  If there is more than one key, you may have one\n      key in the short description, and a different one in the long\n      description, so long both long and short have a keyword in them.\n\n2)    Several different objects may not be restrung with the exact same\n      name.  This means at the same time or over time.  Objects found to\n      be intentionally restrung with duplicate names will be confiscated.\n\n3)    You may not include the name of another character in the restring\n      of an item without the express consent of that character.\n\n4)    Containers must be restrung to something that resembles a container\n      in some fashion.  Be creative, but no restringing \"a bag\" into \"a\n      shoe\".\n\n5)    There is no discount for multiple restrings at the same time.  The\n      pricing listed above is very reasonable. \n\nWhen an Immortal does a restring for you it is polite to pay attention to\nwhat they are saying and it is always a good idea to know what you want\nbefore you ask for a restring (unless you have prior arrangements with that\nimmortal), to avoid causing an Immortal unnecessary trouble.  If you follow\nthe directions given above your experiences with recieving restrings should\nbe wonderful, memorable experiences.\n~\n52 STARTGLAD~\nStartglad is used to start Gladiator events.\nSyntax:\nstartglad <type> <min level> <max level> <ticks till start> <blind/noblind> <ticks till end>\n\nType has to be one of the following:\n     1 - Singles Event\n     2 - Random Teams Event  \n     3 - Assigned Teams Event \n\nLevels have to be between one and sixty.\nTicks till start has to be at least three.\nBlind will hide the names of the other gladiators.\nNoblind will show the gladiators thier opponents Names.\n~\n52 ENDGLAD~\nEndglad is used to end Gladiator events.\nSyntax:\nendglad <victor's name/none>\n\nYou may have the victor of the event announed by passing it to endglad\nor you may say none if no one won.\n~\n52 REMOVEGLAD~\nRemoveglad is used to remove a player from the event.

Who ever cared for this garden was a master,\nbecause even those with the blackest of hearts could easily find peace\nhere.  You can hear the singing of birds and the buzzing of bees as they\ngather pollen from the flowers.  This seems to be one of the few places\nthat the Posse has left untouched since their arrival.

Although all the\nbedding has been thrown about the room,  this looks like a nice place to\nsleep and heal your wounds.  There are cots, beds, and bunks all over\nthe room.  Some of the Posse seem to be a bit sloppy, as there are\nclothes and bloody weapons strewn all over the place.  For some\nstrange reason there seems to be something magical about the bunk\nhouse.  It feels as if you just heal faster in here than anywhere else.\nThis room just gives you a feeling of  goodness, for some that makes\nyou feel quite at home, but for those members of the Posse that are\nmore evil, this room tends to make you queasy.\n~\n0 DK 0\nH 200 M 200\nC posse~\nD2\nExit ~\ndoor~\n16384 0 4703\nS\n#4705\nThe West Wing~\nThis room appears to be an art gallery.

I guess the store owner has friends in high places in the\nPosse.  You can buy all kinds of things here.

The walls\nare hewn out of solid pyrite, and the floor gleams where it has been worn\nfrom the tread of many feet.  A short ivory pillar rises from the floor,\nebony writing inscribed upon it.
